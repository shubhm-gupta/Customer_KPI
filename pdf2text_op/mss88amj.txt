 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 AND FIRM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

 Using Fortune magazine's ratings of corporate reputations, we analyzed
 the relationships between perceptions of firms' corporate social responsi-
 bility and measures of their financial performance. Results show that a
 firm's prior performance, assessed by both stock-market returns and
 accounting-based measures, is more closely related to corporate social
 responsibility than is subsequent performance. Results also show that
 measures of risk are more closely associated with social responsibility
 than previous studies have suggested.

 The management literature has acknowledged social responsibility as an
 important corporate duty (Quinn, Mintzberg, & James, 1987). Given the
 significance of corporate social responsibility in corporate decision making,
 the relationship between a firm's social and ethical policies or actions and
 its financial performance (Arlow & Gannon, 1982; Ullmann, 1985) is an
 important topic.

 Various arguments have been made regarding the relationship between
 firms' social responsibility and their financial performance. One view is that
 firms face a trade-off between social responsibility and financial performance.
 Those holding this view propose that firms incur costs from socially respon-
 sible actions that put them at an economic disadvantage comipared to other,
 less responsible, firms (Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Ullmann, 1985;
 Vance, 1975). A second, contrasting viewpoint is that the explicit costs of
 corporate social responsibility are minimal and that firms may actually bene-
 fit from socially responsible actions in terms of employee morale and pro-
 ductivity (Moskowitz, 1972; Parket & Eibert, 1975; Soloman & Hansen,
 1985). A third perspective is that the costs of socially responsible actions are
 significant but are offset by a reduction in other firm costs. For instance, stake-
 holder theory (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987) suggests that a firm must satisfy not
 only stockholders and bondholders, but also those with less explicit, or
 implicit, claims. Stakeholder theory further suggests that implicit claims like

 product quality are less costly to a firm than explicit claims like wage con-
 tracts or stockholder or bondholder demands. Low social responsibility, how-
 ever, may encourage some stakeholders to doubt the ability of a firm to honor
 implicit claims and may increase the number of a firm's more costly explicit
 claims.

 In addition, Alexander and Bucholtz (1978) and Bowman and Haire
 (1975) have suggested that stakeholders and stock- and bondholders may see
 corporate social responsibility as indicating management skill. In short, a
 firm has an investment in reputation, including its reputation for being
 socially responsible. An increase in perceived social responsibility may im-
 prove the image of the firm's management and permit it to exchange costly
 explicit claims for less costly implicit charges. In contrast, a decline in the
 level of stakeholders' view of a firm's social responsibility may reduce its
 reputation and result in an increase in costly explicit claims.

 In this study, we used data from the Fortune survey of corporate reputa-
 tions to examine two aspects of the relationship between corporate social
 responsibility and firm financial performance that previous research has
 ignored. First, we not only measured performance in terms of accounting-
 and stock-market-based measures but also in terms of risk. Second, we
 examined not only the extent to which social responsibility predicted finan-
 cial performance but also whether prior financial performance predicted
 social responsibility. This study also improved on the the methodology used
 in previous studies by using evaluations of social responsibility made by
 knowledgeable external sources.

 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

 Research into the relationship between corporate social responsibility
 and financial performance has been based on several theoretical arguments.
 Those who have suggested a negative relation between social responsibility
 and financial performance have argued that high responsibility results in
 additional costs that put a firm at an economic disadvantage compared to
 other, less socially responsible firms (Bragdon & Marlin, 1985; Vance, 1975).
 These added costs may result from actions like making extensive charitable
 contributions, promoting community development plans, maintaining plants
 in economically depressed locations, and establishing environmental protec-
 tion procedures. In addition, concern for social responsibility may limit a
 firm's strategic alternatives. For example, a firm may forgo certain product
 lines, such as weapons or pesticides, and avoid plant relocations and invest-
 ment opportunities in certain locations (e.g., South Africa).

 In contrast, other scholars investigating corporate social responsibility
 and performance have argued for a positive association. Several authors
 have cited improved employee and customer goodwill as an important out-
 come of social responsibility (Davis, 1975; Soloman & Hansen, 1985). For
 example, a firm perceived as high in social responsibility may face relatively
 few labor problems, and customers may be favorably disposed to its products.
 Socially responsible activities may also improve a firm's standing with such

 important constituencies as bankers, investors, and government officials.
 Improved relationships with these constituencies may bring economic bene-
 fits (Moussavi & Evans, 1986). Indeed, banks and other institutional invest-
 ors have reported social considerations to be a factor in their investment
 decisions (Spicer, 1978). High corporate social responsibility may therefore
 improve a firm's access to sources of capital.

 Lastly, modern corporate stakeholder theory (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987)
 contends that the value of a firm depends on the cost not only of explicit
 claims but also of implicit claims. From this viewpoint, the set of claimants
 on a firm's resources goes beyond the stockholders and bondholders to in-
 clude stakeholders who have explicit claims on the firm like wage contracts
 and others with whom the firm has made implicit contracts, involving, for
 instance, quality service and social responsibility. If a firm does not act in a
 socially responsible manner, parties to implicit contracts concerning the
 social responsibility of the firm may attempt to transform those implicit
 agreements into explicit agreements that will be more costly to it. For example,
 if a firm fails to meet promises to government officials in regard to actions
 that affect the environment (dumping, etc.), government agencies may find
 it necessary to pass more stringent regulations, constituting explicit contracts,
 to force the firm to act in a socially responsible manner. Moreover, socially,
 irresponsible actions may spill over to other implicit stakeholders, who may
 doubt whether the firm would lhonor their claims. Thus, firms with an image
 of high corporate social responsibility may find that they have more low-cost
 implicit claims than other firms and thus have higher financial performiance
 (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987).

 Although theory and research have focused primarily on the relation-
 ship between corporate social responsibility and measures of financial
 performance, an argument for a relationship between social responsibility
 and such measures of financial risk as variance in earnings and in stock
 returns can also be made (Spicer, 1978; Ullmann, 1985). First, low levels of
 social responsibility may increase a firm's financial risk. Investors may
 consider less socially responsible firms to be riskier investments because
 they see inanagement skills at the firm as low (Alexander & Bucholtz, 1978;
 Spicer, 1978). Investors and other constituencies may also anticipate an
 increase in firm costs owing to lack of social responsibility. For example, the
 government may levy fines, and law suits, such as those recently filed against
 pharmaceutical, chemical, and asbestos firms, that may threaten a firm's
 very existence. Perceptions of low social responsibility may also decrease a
 firm's ability to obtain capital at consistent rates.

 In contrast, a high degree of corporate social responsibility may permit a
 firm to have relatively low financial risk as the result of more stable relations
 with the government and the financial community. In addition, to the degree
 that a firm has high social responsibility, it may also have a low percentage of
 total debt to total assets. A low total debt ensures that a firm can easily
 continue to satisfy implicit claims. Thus, compared to other firms, firms

 with high social responsibility may have lower market- and accounting-
 based total risk because they are less sensitive to certain external events, like
 governmental actions, and have a lower debt. The impact of social responsibil-
 ity on measures of a firm's systematic risk may, however, be minimal, since
 most events affecting a firm's level of social responsibility do not system-
 atically affect all other firms in the marketplace (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987).
 Most studies have related social responsibility and concurrent financial
 performance. We also explored the effects of prior and subsequent perfor-
 mance on subsequent and prior evaluations of corporate social responsibility.
 The theoretical arguments suggested regarding the concurrent relationship
 between corporate social responsibility and financial performance also apply
 to the relationship with subsequent financial performance. The benefits of
 social responsibility cited earlier (e.g., employee motivation, customer good-
 will) may carry over into later periods. To the degree that a firm with
 relatively high social responsibility can implement implicit contracts, its
 financial performance may improve and variability in market- and
 accounting-based performance measures may decline.

 Corporate social responsibility may also be linked to past firm perfor-
 mance. Its financial performance may influence a firm's evolving social pol-
 icy and actions (Ullmann, 1985). Policies and expenditures, particularly in
 discretionary areas suclh as social programs, may be especially sensitive to
 the existence of slack resources (Cyert & March, 1963). If corporate social
 responsibility is viewed as a significant cost, firms with relatively high past
 financial performance may be more willing to absorb these costs in the
 future (Parket & Eibert, 1975; Ullmann, 1985). In contrast, less profitable
 firms may be less willing to undertake socially responsible actions.

 PREVIOUS RESEARCH

 Previous research has yielded mixed results regarding the relationships
 between corporate social responsibility and measures of firm performance.
 Reviews by Aupperle and colleagues (1985), Cochran and Wood (1984), and
 Ullmann (1985) have all found mixed results concerning the concurrent
 relationship between social responsibility and firm performance. Ullmann
 suggested that those conflicting results may derive, in part, from differences
 in research methodologies and measures of financial performance.

 Studies using stock-market-based measures of return have reported mixed
 results regarding the relationship between social responsibility and perfor-
 mance. Moskowitz (1972) ranked 67 selected firms in terms of his evaluation
 of their level of social responsibility and reported higher than average stock
 returns for highly ranked firms. Vance (1975), however, found a subset of the
 firms rated by Moskowitz had lower stock-market performance than a com-
 parison sample of firms listed in the New York Stock Exchange Composite
 Index, Dow Jones Industrials, and Standard and Poor's Industrials. The stud-
 ies by Vance and Moskowitz, however, both failed to adjust for risk. Other
 studies that have attempted to adjust stock-return performance measures for
 risk have found little relationship between social responsibility and market

 performance. Alexander and Bucholtz (1978), using the firms listed in
 Moskowitz's study, found little association between social responsibility
 and risk-adjusted return on securities.1

 Studies examining the relationship between social responsibility and
 accounting-based performance measures have generally found positive results.
 Bragdon and Marlin (1972), Bowman and Haire (1975), and Parket and Eibert
 (1975) found generally positive associations between corporate social
 responsibility and accounting-based measures of performance. However, those
 studies did not control for the possible effects of other variables. Later studies
 that have attempted to control for differences in risk have offered more
 cautious support for the relationship between social responsibility and
 accounting-based performance measures. Cochran and Wood (1984) found a
 positive correlation between social responsibility and accounting perfor-
 mance after controlling for the age of assets. In contrast, Aupperle and col-
 leagues (1985) found no significant relationships between social responsibil-
 ity and a firm's ROA adjusted by its ranking in the Value Line Safety Index.
 Since financial risk and performance vary with industry, Sturdivant and
 Ginter (1977) compared accounting-based measures of performance for a
 subsample of the firms rated by Moskowitz to industry averages. They catego-
 rized firms as best, honorably mentioned, and worst in terms of social
 responsibility. Firms given an honorable mention had higher accounting-
 based performance than the other firms.

 Previous studies on the relationship between social responsibility and risk
 have also produced mixed results. Spicer (1978) found that firms rated high
 on social performance, as measured by pollution control activities, had lower
 total and systematic risk than less socially responsible firms. Aupperle and
 colleagues also (1985) found a negative association between corporate social
 responsibility and accounting-based risk but found that the association be-
 tween market-based risk and social responsibility was insignificant.

 Previous studies have also employed varying measures of corporate so-
 cial responsibility. Three methods have commonly been used. The first uses
 expert evaluations of corporate policies. The validity of this methodology, of
 course, depends on the skill and qualifications of those making the assess-
 ments (Abbott & Monsen, 1979). Previous studies have used an index from
 the Council of Concerned Businessmen (Sturdivant & Ginter, 1977) and two
 rankings from Business and Society (Moskowitz, 1972, 1975). The validity of
 these indexes is subject to criticism. Moskowitz's ratings were based on his
 own evaluation. In the case of the ratings published in 1975, done on sam-
 ples of businessmen and M.B.A. students, the expertise of the evaluators and
 the accuracy of the information are questionable (Bowman & Haire, 1975).
 Other researchers have used content analysis of corporate annual reports
 or other corporate documents (Ab'bot & Monsen, 1979; Anderson & Frankel,

 I Adjusting for beta adjusts for systematic or general market risk. Lubatkin and Shrieves
 (1986) and Aaker and Jacobson (1987) discuss the adjustment of market-based performance
 measures for risk.

 1980; Bowman & Haire, 1975; Preston, 1978). Such measures, however, con-
 fuse social orientation with corporate actions (Arlow & Gannon, 1982;
 Ullmann, 1985). Moreover, such documents often have more public rela-
 tions value than informational value. The relationship between such public
 statements and actual corporate actions is uncertain. Bowman and Haire
 found a positive association between emphasis on corporate social responsi-
 bility in annual reports and the Moskowitz ratings. Preston, however, found
 no relation between these variables. Parket and Eibert (1975) used a
 corporation's willingness to respond to a questionnaire on social responsibility
 as an indicator of the firm's concern with the issue.

 The third method of measuring corporate social responsibility uses per-
 formance in controlling pollution as a proxy measure. The Council of Con-
 cerned Businessmen Pollution Performance Index is frequently used (Bragdon
 & Marlin, 1972; Folger & Nutt, 1975; Spicer, 1978). Pollution control, however,
 reflects only one aspect of social responsibility and is only valid for certain
 industries (Bragdon & Marlin, 1972).

 The types of measures previous studies have used influence results be-
 cause accounting- and stock-market-based performance measures focus on
 different aspects of performance, and each is subject to particular biases
 (McGuire, Schneeweis, & Hill, 1986). Accounting-based measures tap only
 historical aspects of firm performance (McGuire, Schneeweis, & Hill, 1986).
 Moreover, they are subject to bias from managerial manipulation and differ-
 ences in accounting procedures (Branch, 1983; Brilloff, 1972, 1976). Account-
 ing performance should also be adjusted for risk, industry characteristics,
 and other variables (Aaker & Jacobson, 1987; Arlow & Gannon, 1982;
 Davidson, Worrell, & Gilberton, 1986; Michel & Shaked, 1984; Ullmann,
 1985).

 To avoid the problems of accounting-based measures, some authors have
 used stock-market-based measures of performance. Market returns have sev-
 eral advantages over accounting-based measures: they are (1) less suscepti-
 ble to differential accounting procedures and managerial manipulation and
 (2) represent investors' evaluations of a firm's ability to generate future eco-
 nomic earnings rather than past performance.

 Problems also exist, however, with the use of stock-market-based mea-
 sures of performance (McGuire, Schneeweis, & Branch, 1986). Ullmann (1985)
 suggested that the use of market measures implies that investors' valuation
 of firm performance is a proper performance measure. Since firms face
 multiple constituencies (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), sole concentration on
 investors' evaluations may not be sufficient.

 Given the debate over the proper measure of financial performance, in
 this study we used both accounting- and stock-market-based measures to
 investigate the relationships between concurrently, previously, and sub-
 sequently measured firm performance and corporate social responsibility.
 We also improved upon the methodology used in previous studies by using

 evaluations of corporate social responsibility from knowledgeable external
 sources.

 Data

 METHODS

 Data on corporate social responsibility were obtained from Fortune
 magazine's annual survey of corporate reputations. Fortune has conducted
 the survey each fall since 1982 and published summary results each January.
 The survey covers the largest firms in 20-25 industry groups (the number of
 industry groups varies from year to year). Over 8,000 executives, outside
 directors, and corporate analysts are asked to rate the ten largest companies
 in their industry on eight attributes: financial soundness, long-term invest-
 ment value, use of corporate assets, quality of management, innovativeness,
 quality of products or services, use of corporate talent, and community and
 environmental responsibility. Ratings are on a scale of 0 (poor) to 10
 (excellent). The response rate of those surveyed has averaged almost 50
 percent for each year of the survey (Fortune, 1983, 1986). Chakravarthy (1986)
 and Wartick (1987) have also used this data set.

 The Fortune magazine survey was chosen for several reasons. First, it
 provides comparable data over an extended period. Second, the number of
 respondents is comparable or superior to those of other ratings. Third, re-
 spondents rate only firms in an industry with which they are familiar. They
 have direct access to internal firm and industry information that is particu-
 larly critical in the area of corporate social responsibility, where annual
 reports and other official documents provide incomplete and inconsistent
 information (Bowman & Haire, 1979).Z

 Evidence for the validity of the evaluations comes from empirical stud-
 ies using other dimensions of the Fortune survey (Chakravarthy, 1986;
 McGuire, Schneeweis, & Branch, 1987). Those studies have found that the
 Fortune evaluations of firms' financial performance are highly correlated
 with accounting- and stock-market-based performance measures. Major
 changes in a firm's ranking often correspond to specific events, such as
 product changes or lawsuits, or to changes in performance (Fortune, 1986).
 The Fortune ratings differ from those of other evaluators of social responsibil-
 ity in that the respondents are selected for their knowledge of a particular
 industry rather than for their specific knowledge of or interest in corporate
 social responsibility. Thus, their interpretation and evaluation of social re-
 sponsibility may differ from those of others who are specifically interested in
 the issue. Wartick (1987), however, found the Fortune ratings to be associ-
 ated with membership in the Issues Management Association, which sug-

 2 Industry analysts follow firms in a particular industry and advise investment houses and
 other institutional investors. Their livelihood, and that of their employers and investors, de-
 pends on their knowledge of firms in an industry. Since corporate social responsibility is one
 consideration in analysts' investment decisions (Spicer, 1978), they would be knowledgeable in
 this aspect of firm performance.

 gests that the ratings do indicate an orientation toward corporate social
 responsibility.3

 To evaluate the reliability of the ratings, we checked for consistency
 between the 1985 and 1986 evaluations. Although some modification of the
 ratings could be expected because of changing conditions and firm actions,
 major modifications would suggest lack of reliability. It should also be noted
 that the respondents Fortune uses change slightly each year. The correlation
 between the two sets of evaluations was .899.

 Measures of Financial Performance

 Data on accounting- and stock-market-based measures of firm perfor-
 mance and risk were obtained from the COMPUSTAT data base. The Appen-
 dix defines the measures of firm performance and risk we used. Market
 performance was measured by risk-adjusted return, or alpha, and total return.
 Market risk measures were beta, a measure of systematic risk, and the stan-
 dard deviation of total return. Accounting-based performance measures were
 return on assets (ROA), total assets, sales growth, asset growth, and operating
 income growth. The ratio of debt to assets, operating leverage, and the stan-
 dard deviation of operating income were our accounting-based measures of
 risk.

 Periods of Analysis

 Two sets of ratings of corporate social responsibility were used in this
 analysis. First, we computed average rankings for the period 1983-85, includ-
 ing the 98 firms and industries that appeared in all the yearly surveys and for
 which financial performance data were available. Second, to permit analysis
 of the relationship between corporate social responsibility and previous and
 subsequent firm financial performance, we used ratings of social responsibility
 for one year, 1983. Fortune produced these ratings in late 1982 and pub-
 lished them in January 1983. All the 131 firms rated by Fortune and for
 which financial performance data were available were included in this
 analysis.4

 3 To further validate the ratings, we compared the Fortune ratings to a rating of corporate
 social responsibility produced by the Council on Economic Priorities (1987). The council evalu-
 ated consumer products firms on charitable contributions, representation of women and minori-
 ties on their boards of directors and in executive positions, social disclosure, South Africa
 involvement, and nuclear and nonnuclear arms production. Ratings of the 58 firms by both
 sources were compared by summing the number of "positive" or "socially responsible" evalua-
 tions given by the Council of Economic Priorities. The correlation between the two sets of
 evaluations was .47. Although the correlation is not as strong as would have been hoped, it is of
 interest. The Council of Economic Priorities ratings covered only consumer products, thus
 excluding many of the industries surveyed by Fortune. Moreover, differing definitions of corpo-
 rate social responsibility likely influenced the correlation. For example, the council considered
 holding contracts for arms production to indicate lack of corporate social responsibility and it is
 unlikely that the Fortune evaluators did so.

 4 The mean social responsibility rating for the 1983 survey was 6.01, with a standard
 deviation of .774. The mean 1983-85 rating was 6.31, with a standard deviation of .688. The
 means and standard deviations of the other variables are available from the authors.

 Financial performance variables were averaged over two periods: 1982-84
 and 1977-81. Tables 1 and 2 show correlations among the financial variables
 for the periods studied. The financial performance variables for 1982-84 are
 contemporaneous with the 1983-85 social responsibility ratings and subse-
 quent to the 1983 ratings. Thus, by comparing the 1982-84 financial perfor-
 mance ratings to the average Fortune rating for 1983-85, we could examine
 the concurrent relationship between corporate social responsibility and fi-
 nancial performance. Analysis of 1983 ratings in relation to the 1977-81 and
 1982-84 financial performance variables permitted us to evaluate the relation
 between prior financial performance and corporate social responsibility us-
 ing the 1977-81 measures and to evaluate subsequent financial performance
 using the 1982-84 data.

 Correlational Analysis

 RESULTS

 Concurrent performance. Table 3 presents the correlations between
 contemperaneous evaluations of corporate social performance (1983-85) and
 accounting- and market-based performance measures (1982-84). Correlations
 between social responsibility and stock-market-based measures of perfor-
 mance are insignificant (.04 and -.07), suggesting that there is little contem-
 poraneous association. Three of the accounting-based measures of perfor-
 mance, however, are significantly correlated with corporate social responsi-

 bility. ROA and total assets show positive relationships (.47 and .20,
 respectively), and operating income growth has a negative correlation (-.21).
 The positive association between ROA, an accounting-based measure of con-
 temporaneous performance, and corporate social responsibility supports the
 view that, through its effects on stakeholders, social responsibility affects
 financial performance (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987). The negative association
 with operating income growth might be due to the high social responsibility
 ratings of several mature firms such as IBM (Fortune, 1983, 1986) that may
 tend to have more stable earnings than other firms. The other accounting
 measures have little association with corporate social responsibility.

 The accounting- and stock-market-based risk measures tend to be nega-
 tively associated with social responsibility. Both beta and the standard devia-
 tion of total return show negative correlations (-.27 and -.45, respectively).
 One accounting-based risk measure, the ratio of debt to assets, has a signifi-
 cant negative association with corporate social responsibility. These results
 are also consistent with the view (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987) that firms with
 many implicit contracts with stakeholders may have lower debt than other
 firms.

 Pre- and post-survey analysis. Analysis of the concurrently measured
 relationship between social responsibility and financial performance does
 not address the question of whether prior high financial performance allows
 a firm to engage in future socially responsible activities or if significant
 associations between current social responsibility and performance are arti-
 facts of previous high performance. Table 3 presents results of the correla-
 tion analysis between prior firm financial performance and corporate social
 responsibility. The level of correlation for two measures of market return,
 total return and alpha, provides little support for the relationship between
 prior stock-market performance and subsequent social responsibility: the
 correlations are positive but significant only for alpha. Of the accounting-
 based performance measures, ROA, sales growth, and asset growth are
 associated with high perceived social responsibility (.52, .15, and .35), but
 correlations for the other accounting performance measures are insignificant.
 Corporate social responsibility is negatively associated with risk as measured
 by the ratio of debt to assets (-.49), beta (-.32), and the standard devia-
 tion of total return (-.44) and positively associated with operating leverage.
 These results suggest that low-risk firms and firms with a high return on assets
 will later have an image of high social responsibility.

 Table 3 also shows the correlations between corporate social responsibil-
 ity and performance measured at a later time. ROA is again highly correlated
 with social responsibility; measures of stock-market performance, however,
 show little association with it. However, both stock-market and accounting-
 based risk measures are negatively correlated with previous social responsi-
 bility (debt to assets -.44, beta, -.32; standard deviation of total return,
 -.44).

 Regression Analysis

 To test the multivariate relationship between corporate social responsi-
 bility and firm performance, we also conducted regression analyses. Since
 measures of financial performance tend to be correlated (McGuire, Schnee-
 weis, & Branch, 1986), care must be taken in interpreting individual regres-
 sion coefficients. Table 4 presents the results of stepwise regression analyses
 using perceived corporate social responsibility in 1983 as the independent
 variable.

 Prior stock-market and accounting-based performance measures were
 used separately to predict social responsibility. Accounting-based perfor-
 mance had a higher explanatory value than stock-market performance (R2 =
 .294 and .129, respectively.) Accounting risk variables also appeared to pro-
 duce a better explanatory model than stock-market risk variables (R 2 = .287

 868 Academy of Management Journal December

 and .211, respectively). One possible reason for these results is that two
 market-based measures, total return and beta, are related primarily to system-
 atic movements among all firms. In contrast, accounting measures are more
 likely to capture unique, or unsystematic, firm attributes. Since actions lead-
 ing to high or low perceived corporate social responsibility may be pre-
 dominately unsystematic, accounting performance may better capture social
 responsibility.

 Subsequently measured accounting-based performance appeared to be a
 better predictor of social responsibility than subsequent stock-market perfor-
 mance (R2 = .195 and .052, respectively). In contrast, subsequent stock-
 market risk produced a better explanatory model than subsequent account-
 ing risk (R2 = .193 and .287).

 A comparison of equations using performance measured before and after
 1983 thus suggests that perceptions of social responsibility are more closely
 associated with prior financial performance than with subsequent financial
 performance. With only one exception, prior performance and risk were
 better predictors than were subsequent performance and risk. The results of
 regression equations in which both market- and accounting-based risk and
 return are used to explain social responsibility offer further support. In all
 cases, the equations using prior accounting- and stock-market-based
 measures of risk and return had a higher predictive value than those using
 subsequent measures.

 DISCUSSION

 The correlation and regression results presented in this study suggest
 several conclusions. First, although performance tended to predict corporate
 social responsibility better than risk, measures of risk also explained a
 significant portion of the variability in social responsibility across firms. We
 noted earlier that theoretical arguments can be made for a relationship be-
 tween social responsibility and firm risk. Lack of social responsibility may
 expose a firm to significant additional risk from lawsuits and fines and may
 limit its strategic options. Rather than looking for increased profitability
 from socially responsible actions, managers and those interested in the finan-
 cial impact of social responsibility might look toward reduced risk. Since
 high risk must be balanced by high returns, firms with low social responsibil-
 ity should earn high returns to justify the increased risk. Our data, however,
 suggest that firms low in social responsibility also experience lower ROA
 and stock-market returns than do firms high in social responsibility.

 Second, accounting-based measures, particularly ROA, proved to be bet-
 ter predictors of corporate social responsbility than market measures. There
 may be several reasons for this trend. If perceptions of social responsibility
 are firm-specific (unsystematic), accounting measures of return should be
 more sensitive to them than stock-market measures, which reflect systematic
 market trends. Moreover, indexes are subject to managerial manipulation
 (Branch, 1983; Briloff, 1972, 1976) and tend to be stable over time (McGuire,

 1988 McGuire, Sundgren, and Schneeweis 869

 Schneeweis, & Hill, 1986). Stock-market returns are more variable over time
 since they primarily respond to unexpected changes in information.

 Perhaps most interesting is that prior performance is generally a better
 predictor of corporate social responsibility than subsequent performance.
 Thus, associations found between concurrent social responsibility and per-
 formance may partially be artifacts of previous high financial performance.
 Firms with high performance and low risk may be better able to afford to act
 in a socially responsible manner. Links between responsibility and subse-
 quent financial performance may also be artifacts of prior high performance
 and the stability of accounting return data. Subsequent studies should at-
 tempt to separate the effects of prior, current, and future firm performance
 on the relationship between financial performance and corporate social
 responsibility.

 CONCLUSIONS

 The results of this study suggest several conclusions and avenues for
 future research. First, rather than examining the relationship between corpo-
 rate social responsibility and a firm's subsequent financial performance,
 future research should investigate the influence of prior firm performance.
 In essence, it may be more fruitful to consider financial performance as a
 variable influencing social responsibility than the reverse. Previous studies
 have emphasized management preferences, industry, and organizational char-
 acteristics as influencing social responsibility (Arlow & Gannon, 1982;
 Sturdivant & Ginter, 1977). Second, the results suggest reduction of firm risk
 as an important benefit of social responsibility, one that previous research
 focusing on firm profitability and stock-market return has overlooked. Inves-
 tigation of those two areas would do more to move research on social respon-
 sibility into theoretically and empirically fruitful areas than does investiga-
 tion of concurrent measures (Ullmann, 1985).

 This study also suggests that researchers give increased attention to the
 measure of firm performance used in studies of corporate social responsibility.
 Davidson, Worrell, and Gilberton (1986) noted that researchers have viewed
 the choice of performance variables as relatively straightforward compared
 to the problems of measuring corporate social responsibility. They further
 suggested that social responsibility may influence various aspects of firm
 performance in different ways. The inconsistency of results obtained using
 various financial performance variables supports that suggestion. Thus, this
 study adds to the growing body of literature indicating that the choice of
 performance variable can have substantive implications for the results of
 research and that researchers must carefully choose performance measures
 that are appropriate to the particular research question they are investigating.
 The results reported here also support the importance of controlling for risk
 in studies of social responsibility because adjusting for risk affects perfor-
 mance measures.

 Although the Fortune data have provided a measure of corporate social
 responsibility new to the literature, the validity and appropriateness of this

 measure require further examination. As do other measures of social
 responsibility, the Fortune ratings may reflect the biases of the evaluators,
 who may not have defined or evaluated corporate social responsibility as
 other, less financially oriented evaluators might have. In addition, the con-
 text and purposes of the Fortune evaluation, which differ from those of other
 evaluations, may have influenced results.

 However, major shortcomings in current research in corporate social
 responsibility have been the difficulty of measuring that concept (Abbott &
 Monsen, 1979; Ullmann, 1985) and consequent reliance on a limited set of
 measures. The introduction of a new measure of social responsibility helps
 reduce the mono-measure bias that has plagued the current body of research.

 Alpha ((x) was defined as return in excess of that due to general market movements, derived

 from the following market model:

 APPENDIX

 RT I &i + biRMt

 where Rit = return on firm i in period t,

 Mt = return on index M (Standard and Poor's 500 Industrials) in period t,

 & =1R- bRm, and

 Cov (Ri. RM)

 Var (RM)

 Assets growth was the percent change in total assets (change in total assets/total assets).
 Average assets were beginning assets less ending assets divided by 2. Beta (,) was the covari-
 ance of a firm's stock-market return relative to the return of the stock market, standardized by
 stock-market return variance derived from the market model equation. Systematic, nondiversi-
 fiable risk. Ratio of debt to assets was total debt divided by total assets. Operating income
 growth was the percent change in operating income. Operating income is net sales less cost of
 goods sold and operating expenses before deducting depreciation, amortization, and depletion.
 Operating leverage was the extent to which fixed costs were used in a firm's operation. We
 used break-even analysis to measure the extent to which operating leverage was employed.
 Operating leverage = (sales-variable costs)/(sales-variable costs-fixed costs). Return on assets
 (ROA) is a measure of operating performance of how well assets have been employed since
 being received by a firm. Measured as (net income + interest expense)/average total assets. Sales
 growth was the percent change in gross sales and other operating revenue less discounts,
 returns, and allowances (change in sales/sales). Standard deviation in operating income growth,
 a measure of the variability in operating income growth (OIG), was defined as

 n

 E (OIG - OIG)2/n,

 where n = number of years.

 Standard deviation in total return (SDTR), a measure of the variability in stock-market return,
 was defined as

 n
 X (TR - TR)2/n.

 Total return was the percent change in stock-market valuation in year t, measured as [(pricet +
 dividendt) - price t-_)]/ pricet-1.
