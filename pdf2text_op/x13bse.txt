ABSTRACT
Research interest in examining corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developing economies
is on the rise; however, our knowledge of the role of government in CSR remains limited.
The aim of this paper is therefore to bridge this gap with an investigation into the speciﬁc
CSR strategies that global ﬁrms have developed in the world’s largest emerging economy
and a nominally communist country, namely China. Drawing on institutional theory and a
relational governance perspective, we posit that rather than adopting a canonical holistic CSR
stakeholder model as typically observed in Western countries, these ﬁrms adopt a preferential
stakeholder model using government-aimed and consumer-aimed CSR strategically. Our em-
pirical study sampled 17 global retailers operating in China, with a dataset compiled to include
their CSR web announcement data and ﬁrm performance data. The results of partial least
squares modelling suggest that only government-aimed CSR plays a salient role in enhancing
retailers’ performance. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

Introduction

T HE NOTION OF MAINSTREAM CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) RELATES TO A COMPANY’S PERCEIVED SOCIETAL

or stakeholder obligations (Brown and Dacin, 1997), and aims to improve social conditions (Godfrey
et al., 2009). But it is not difﬁcult to observe that CSR appears to be a Western-deﬁned concept, because
its origin is deeply rooted in the democratic capitalist countries (Habisch et al., 2005; Carroll, 2008;
Moon et al., 2010). Therefore, such ‘responsibilities’ are typically associated with American and European perceived
societal or stakeholder obligations (Ramasamy and Yeung, 2009). Indeed, central to the spirit of CSR is its
stakeholder doctrine, in which a ﬁrm holds its employees, customers, community and government together as
stakeholders (Lockett et al., 2006); CSR can be used to signal management acumen to stakeholders and investors
(Alexander and Buchholz, 1978).

Recently, there has been much debate about the paucity of literature examining CSR in developing countries:
their economic, social and legal institutions are undergoing unprecedented changes, creating severe challenges
for the Western-deﬁned CSR paradigm. Kolk et al. (2010), for instance, found that Chinese domestic and foreign
retailers have different dimensions for reporting their CSR. Idemudia (2011) point out the urgency of readdressing

CSR from a South-centred/developing agenda, in which concerns and priorities are invariably different from those
of Western countries. Further, they ﬁnd an examination of the role of government to be particularly lacking for
developing countries. Moon and Shen (2010) agree that CSR in a developing, non-democratic country such as China
is in a rather different situation from CSR in Western countries: ‘CSR [. . .] the concept traditionally associated with
discretionary activity beyond that required by government, is now endorsed and encouraged by a government still,
symbolically, at least, inﬂuenced by Marxism-Leninism, and a Communist Party’ (Moon and Shen, 2010, p. 615).
Indeed, as China has become the world’s second largest economy after the USA (Financial Times, 20101), the
possible differences in CSR that may arise from China’s unique market and institutional environment (Li et al.,
2009; Kolk et al., 2010; Sheng et al., 2011) are yet to be detailed, and there has been little research in this area. It appears
that, the very nature of CSR – predominantly a Western-bounded concept – may weaken its general applicability.

The aim of this paper is to understand the development of CSR theory from the point of view of the contempo-
rary Chinese environment, and in particular to shed some light on the role of the government in CSR – an area
which has very little coverage in the existing literature. Motivated by the aim of ﬁlling this gap, this study addresses
the following two speciﬁc research questions. As the emerging Chinese economy has its own distinctive economic,
social, and legal institutions: (1) who are the crucial stakeholders for CSR of foreign ﬁrm in China and (2) what
are the effects of CSR on the ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms? To date, it remains unclear whether foreign ﬁrms
in China adopt the stakeholder viewpoint of CSR in which ﬁrms target its employees, customers, community and
government together as stakeholders (Lockett et al., 2006) in a systematic manner.

We selected foreign retailers in China for our empirical investigation, for four reasons. First, current academic
research on CSR in China is biased towards manufacturing industry (Cheung et al., 2010; Li and Zhang, 2010).
We therefore choose to draw samples from global retailers in a more service-oriented industry. Second, retailing
is one of the few industries that have a high negative impact on the environment – the various possible externalities
from its supply chain, packaging and employment. Third, after China’s accession into the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO) where foreign direct investments are permitted, major global retailers are now operating in China,
and they are usually one of the few major employers (Jones et al., 2005). Fourth, most global retail ﬁrms have set
up dedicated and ever-more sophisticated CSR sections and update their CSR announcements on their corporate
website regularly. This has offered rich data sources for earlier studies of CSR in China (Kolk et al., 2010).
Therefore, our choice of the retail industry has a better foundation to build on and to create a degree of continuity
for this stream of research.

The paper is set out as follows: we began with a conceptual development of the types and effects of foreign
retailers’ CSR in China, drawing on institutional theory and relational governance theory. We then propose a
theoretical framework with hypotheses based on our conceptual development. Data were collected from 93 ﬁrm-year
observations based on 17 leading global retailers’ corporate CSR web announcements and secondary datasets on
ﬁrm performance in China from 2001–2009. A partial least squares (PLS) modelling technique was employed to
test the hypothesised relationships. Finally, we conclude our paper by discussing our results, contributions to the
literature and managerial implications.

Theory and Hypotheses

In a developed Western society, CSR is broadly deﬁned as an ‘organisation’s status and activities with respect to its
perceived societal obligations’ (Brown and Dacin, 1997, p. 68). Nevertheless, there is no strong consensus on a
deﬁnition for CSR (McWilliams et al., 2006). For one thing, as per Brown and Dacin’s (1997) deﬁnition, CSR is
for fulﬁlling societal obligations. Yet societal obligations as largely perceived are also constantly changing, and
particularly so in cross-border and cross-cultural contexts. Ethically, what is perceived as acceptable or pro-social
may not be so in all countries, or at may least appear less effective from a ﬁrm’s strategic perspective. As Davis puts:
‘social responsibility begins where the law ends. . .. It is a ﬁrm’s acceptance of a social obligation beyond the require-
ment of the law’. This criterion implies a certain standard of legal system in the country in which the company is

operating. In a developing country such as China, which has becomes the world’s fastest growing market, the social,
legal, and economic institutions are all undergoing considerable change. However, when the environment is chang-
ing, corporate orientation and strategy are also changing, particularly for global retailers (Alexander and Doherty,
2010).

We therefore theorise that global retailers in China do not adopt a typical mainstream canonical Western CSR
format aiming at their employees, customers, community and government as equally important stakeholders
(Lockett et al., 2006) in a systematic manner. Instead, an actor-speciﬁc, preferential stakeholder CSR model is adopted
in China with two types of CSR, at least at the current stage: government-aimed CSR and consumer-aimed CSR.

First, according to institutional theory (Scott, 2004), we posit that after entering the Chinese market, foreign
ﬁrms quickly learn the deeper and more resilient aspects of Chinese social structure and become acclimatised
to Chinese schemas, rules, norms and routines. This learning is accelerated for those retailers who have merged
with or acquired local Chinese retail chains (Kearney, 2010). In Western societies, ﬁrm leaders from Fortune
500 companies, for example, regard CSR as a dual-purpose tool both to contribute to society and to boost the ﬁrm’s
performances when used properly and wisely. Thus, large ﬁrms operating in China have the capability to re-deﬁne
and re-implement their CSR for the host market.

In China, facing the dual pressures of making their expected contribution to the welfare of Chinese society and a
good business performance in the emerging Chinese economy, foreign retailers have to strategically redeﬁne and
optimise their Western CSR agenda to suit the Chinese context. Institutional pressures have been suggested to
be a key factor driving ﬁrms’ proactive environmental strategies (Sangle, 2010). Despite the fact that CSR has been
institutionalised in the Chinese legal system, there is a large amount of ‘ambiguity and unpredictability in rules and
deﬁciency in implementation’. Debate on the nature of CSR, therefore, as either an exhortatory provision or a
ﬁduciary duty under company law, is heated (Qu, 2007, p. 96). Under the unique Chinese political economy,
current Chinese domestic companies are reported to be reluctant to devote themselves to CSR activities (Li and
Zhang, 2010; Moon and Shen, 2010). Therefore, the ‘foreignness’ of global retailers in China inevitably bears costs
arising from the Chinese government’s expectations and legal requirements that foreign retailers fulﬁl their CSR
duties, given their institutional pressures, their ﬁnancial resources and ambitions in China. Being ‘foreign’ actually
translates into having a responsibility to promote CSR in China.

Second, we also draw on a relational governance perspective (Rindﬂeisch and Heide, 1997): building relational
ties with the government and consumers beneﬁts a ﬁrm by way of an informal means of governance for coordinat-
ing exchanges. This is particularly relevant for the retail industry which serves as the last link in the supply chain
that interacts directly with consumers on a daily basis.

In modern China, a stable and uniﬁed legal framework has not yet been established (Luo, 2007) and marked
differences in the market and institutional environment are present (Li et al., 2009; Sheng et al., 2011). There is
no nationally enforced labour contract law (Luo, 2007), thus rendering employees as less crucial stakeholders.
Neither is the community a key stakeholder: Chinese communities are organised into ‘Jie-dao’ (a sub-district ofﬁce
equivalent to the British borough), ‘Li-long’ (literally meaning households in the lanes and alleys) and ‘Xiao-qu’
(meaning neighbourhood), subunits of the local authorities where the Party leads. These Jie-dao and Li-long are
communities that are organised political subunits and sometimes have considerable inﬂuences. Internally, this
organisational structure is concerned with job creation and stability; externally, its political function reaches the
deepest social domain such as organizing residents to carry out regular cultural, entertainment, sports activities
and helping people with disabilities ﬁnd employment. Yet, some literature does argue that the role of the Jie-dao
has evolved to focus more on improving resource allocation and urban development (Zhang, 2002) and probably
less on inﬂuencing the public’s behaviour as strongly as before. This can be found especially in economically
advantaged Chinese cities where business orientation appears more valued than political orientation.2 Overall, how-
ever, as communities are highly embedded in the multiple levels of Chinese political governance structures, i.e.
state and municipal governments, municipal and district governments, and district and sub-district governments,
we would argue that elements relating to Chinese social behaviour are adopted, and consequently adapted after
being mediated by these levels of governance structure.

2The author thanks one of the reviewers for his/her insight on the political system of China, particularly relating to the role of Jie-dao which does
not have obvious effect on the behaviour of the public at the current stage.

In addition, in China there is effectively no independent ‘third sector’. This is an important issue, and Lin
(2010, p. 95) clearly explains the relationship between non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in China and the
Chinese government as follows: ‘NGO[s] [are] still controlled by the governmental authority and NGOs’ CSR agenda
should play out within the political environment permitted by the government’ and ‘state-led CSR initiatives in
China consequently take on a more inﬂuential role than in many other countries worldwide’. In a sense, there is
not really a third-sector in China. NGOs work together with the government to provide public goods or services.
Elements of CSR, such as philanthropic donations, could be very instrumental to and welcomed by government
if they alleviate some of the burden of the government’s social duties.

Overall, in line with relational governance perspective (Rindﬂeisch and Heide, 1997) and institutional perspec-
tives (North 1990), we theorise that foreign retailers adopt a selective CSR agenda that purposefully targets
speciﬁc stakeholders as preferential parties for exchange of CSR activity. Foreign retailers’ CSR divisions, functions
and their CSR announcements either online or ofﬂine form institutions to support the effective functioning of
their retail trading in China. Below, we elaborate on the two speciﬁc types of CSR adopted by foreign retailers
and offer justiﬁcations.

Government-aimed CSR
In the canonical Western holistic CSR stakeholder model, stakeholders are deﬁned as a ﬁrm’s full repertoire of
employees, customers, community and government (Lockett et al., 2006). In China, government-aimed CSR is
the ﬁrst and foremost type of CSR adopted by foreign retailers. Research shows that good relational exchanges with
government enhance a ﬁrm’s performance (Peng and Luo, 2000; Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006). This is because of
the crucial institutional environment that surrounds foreign retailers. First, the Chinese government plays a consid-
erable role in regulating and even interfering with national economic activities, regulations and laws (Luo, 2007).
For instance, the American government has expressed its concern about the Chinese government’s role in foreign
businesses in China:

[. . .] we are troubled when American investors are prohibited from having wholly owned, fully owned
subsidiaries of their own company in many sectors in China and excluded from sectors, entirely excluded from
competing in other sectors; restrictions that no other major economy in the world imposes on us or anyone else
so broadly (Vice President Joseph Biden, Ofﬁce of the Vice President, The White House, 21 August 2011)

Second, the Chinese government has exclusive control over the management of national resources and industrial
regulation. The role of the Chinese government has been suggested to ‘still control a signiﬁcant portion of scarce
resources, such as land, bank loans, subsidies, and tax breaks’ (Sheng et al., 2011, p. 3). The need for resources
for retail expansion is heightened as China has become the world’s premiere destination for international retailers,
with most of the leading global retail ﬁrms operating in China (Kearney, 2010). These government-controlled
resources are vital for foreign retailers’ deeper penetration into China in further retail development stages rather
than the initial market-entry stage. For global retailers, China has now entered a maturing stage that is typically
characterised by ‘difﬁculty in securing desirable real estate; consumer spending has expanded signiﬁcantly; local
competition has become more sophisticated’ (Global Retail Development Index, AT Kearney). Market saturation
in Chinese ﬁrst-tier cities determines inevitable industry-wide extended competition into second- and third-tier
cities for market entry.

Unlike the expansion method of using mergers and acquisitions in ﬁrst-tier cities, entry into second- and third-
tier cities is typically organic (Kearney, 2010). In other words, ‘greenﬁeld store’ constructions need signiﬁcant
backing from local government on various issues on such as land acquisitions, bank loans, tax breaks etc. The
following are some examples from retailers’ ofﬁcial strategy statements: ‘In China, the Group is aiming for a regular
rate of organic growth by opening some 20 hypermarkets per year’ (Carrefour Annual Report, 2007); ‘New store
openings and strong comparable store sales led Wal-Mart China to improve its market position’ Wal-Mart Annual
Reports, 2008); ‘In China, having studied the market carefully and developed our long-term strategy, we have begun
to accelerate store and infrastructure development in the economically important and populous coastal provinces’

(Tesco PLC Annual Reports, 2005-2010). Foreign retailers intrinsically and strategically require the government’s
backing in retail expansions and operation (e.g. food safety etc.) and to gain competitive advantages.

Therefore, foreign retailers purposefully foster a government-aimed CSR agenda. Although foreign retailers,
among other multinationals in China, have a history of working with the government, the Ministry of Commerce
of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (MOFCOM) declared in 2008 that the authorisation of retail store openings
was to be deregulated from central to local authorities. This decentralisation improved local government’s appropri-
ation of public investment funds and land allocation in terms of urban development. At the sub-district and
neighbourhood level, ofﬁces like the Property Owners Association, the Business Owners Association, and property
management companies are increasingly instrumental in shaping the community’s landscape (Zhang, 2002).
Carrefour, for instance, had a tough 1-year business negotiation with Millennium Group, Taiyuan in Shanxi
Province vis-à-vis a new store opening in the group’s Central Plaza but ended up making no progress. Eventually,
by approaching and under the mediation of the leader from the ‘Xiaodian Qu’ (i.e. the Xiaodian neighbourhood
committee), where the Central Plaza was located, the contracting process was accelerated and ﬁnally signed between
the Millennium Group and Carrefour. The success of introducing Carrefour into the neighbourhood was later
reported to be the district leader’s achievement in contributing to one of the ‘Key 22 projects in modernizing the
service sector in the area’.3

The local mechanism for resource allocation propels foreign retailers and local government into a tighter relation-
ship. Clearly, retailers’ connections with government ‘offers shortcuts to these resources’ (Sheng et al., 2011, p. 3).
Indeed, in an interview with China’s prominent news group Xinhua News (Xinhua, WTO-Law, 20024) a ‘heavy-
weight’ public relations manager from one of the top Western retailers, pointedly admitted that ‘only when what
we foreign retailers promised to government becomes the government’s political achievements, will we then have
a much more relaxed environment for such as preferential policy treatment’. These ‘achievements’ objectively sat-
isfy and enhance government, particularly local ofﬁcials’ political careers (Du et al., 2008). For retailers, these suc-
cesses in relational exchanges with government turn into an institutional advantage in the market place.

On operational terms, global retailers donate cash or products or services in-kind to the Chinese government
at proper times (e.g. natural disaster relief, government social projects etc.) for rapport building and fostering a
‘reciprocal’ relational exchange mechanism. CSR activities that stress the role of government or its associated
agencies are categorised as ‘government-aimed CSR’ (see Table 1).

Therefore, we hypothesise that:

H1: Global retailers’ government-aimed CSR leads to a positive effect on their retail performance in China.

Consumer-aimed CSR
Another pivotal stakeholder for foreign retailers’ CSR model is the Chinese consumer. Consumer-aimed CSR is
deﬁned as cash or in-kind products or services donated to Chinese consumers directly without mediation by local
government. This type of CSR occurs typically for philanthropic activities e.g. natural disaster relief or community
projects for building consumer rapport. At the outset, Chinese consumers have a unique conceptualisation and
distinct expectations from their Western counterparts in the developed world. As with the pace of Chinese urbani-
sation, a larger middle class means growing consumer power (Ho, 2001) and at the same time a stronger sense of
Chinese nationalism that should particularly concern global retailers regarding impact on ﬁrm performance. We
summarise some consumer-aimed CSR examples in Table 2.

In contrast to Ramasamy and Yeung (2008), who maintain that Chinese consumers rely more on the govern-
ment to regulate the social responsibility of businesses rather than leveraging on their own buying power, the role
of retail consumers in China can sometimes be extremely powerful. First, it would seem that Chinese consumers
appear to show a universal value, i.e. show no discrimination between domestic and foreign ﬁrms regarding their
CSR contributions. For instance, according to Darigan and Post (2009), during the relief effort for the Sichuan

Government-aimed CSR

All Carrefour stores in China collectively donated RMB 1 million to Sichuan
Youth Development Foundation for building new schools to support primary
school pupils who lost school in the Sichuan earthquake (29 August 2008)

President of RT-Mart, Yin Yanliang donated 10 million New Taiwanese yuan
through the Taiwan–China Charity Foundation ‘Gushan donation’ and also
NT 10 million yuan donation to support the disaster areas through the Red
Cross Society of Taiwan (14 May 2008)

The spokesperson of Taiwan Affairs Ofﬁce of the State Council Yangyi declared
that Trust-Mart (Guangzhou) donated RMB 1 million to the ofﬁce (Trust-
Mart archive)

author from selected global retailers’ CSR web pages in Chinese)

earthquake, China’s largest property developer, Vanke, donated 2 million RMB (about GB£189,000) while
Wang-Lao-Ji, a much smaller iced tea manufacturer, donated 100 million RMB. Chinese bloggers called on
Vanke to be penalised by asking shareholders to dump Vanke’s stock. This resulted in Vanke’s share valuation
dropping from 25 RMB to 19.58 RMB in just 1 day. Chinese consumers vowed to buy Wang-Lao-Ji’s iced tea
even though they do not consume that much. Chinese consumers use their buying power, in contrast to
Ramasamy and Yeung’s (2008) ﬁndings, in a self-initiated way to regulate, or exert a normative pressure on,
ﬁrms rather than relying on government.

However, this self-initiated consumer force could be even more devastating against foreign ﬁrms’ overall
business prospects, particularly their ﬁnancial performance in China, partly because of the emerging Chinese
nationalism associated with the growing power of the nation. Irritated Chinese consumers appear to lack cool-
headedness, sophistication and balance, and are perhaps somewhat paranoid. Examples include a boycott of
the fashion house Dior that Sharon Stone represented after she made unfriendly comments on the Chinese
Sichuan earthquake being a result of ‘karma for Tibet’ (FT, 2008).5 Similarly, an organised larger-scale boycott
in 2008 towards the French retailer Carrefour, as a way to register Chinese public’s displeasure over
disruptions of Beijing’s Olympic torch relay in Paris, resulted a sales slump of 20%6 (BBC 20087). Chinese
consumers’ possible accumulated emotional ‘anti-foreignism’ (Deng, 2008) and grudge-holding arising from
perceived foreign and often Western assaults and humiliations is clearly detrimental to any global ﬁrm’s
Chinese ambitions.

To this end, consumer-aimed CSR will highlight global retailers’ perceived social responsibility, reducing
negative perceptions toward world politics and implications for China, and thus possibly enhance customer
satisfaction and ﬁnally leverage the ﬁrm’s performance (Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006). Therefore, we hypothesise
that:

H2: Global retailers’ consumer-aimed CSR leads to a positive effect on their retail performance in China.

As per our discussions, we integrate our theory into a model (see Figure 1).

Methodology

We deﬁne all CSR in the following as only that related to ‘donated cash or in-kind products or services’ (Luo and
Bhattacharya, 2006). These are CSR initiatives that can be quantiﬁable on a monetary basis and are what is

announced by global retailers explicitly on their CSR webpages or CSR reports. This is an objective measure for
CSR. Internet-based CSR reports are increasingly adopted by ﬁrms and are becoming an important source for
researchers studying sustainability issues systematically (Morhardt, 2010). It allows for easier data collection, and
the disaggregation of CSR measures to different types would provide managerially actionable guidance for
retail managers.

The data used involve four stage of data collection. First, it was necessary to identify for this study the target global
retailers operating in China. A list of member retailers in China was downloaded from the China Chain Store and
Franchise Association’s (CCFA) freely accessible online database. This database is commonly used when quantita-
tive researchers draw samples of foreign retailers in China for their studies (e.g. Kolk et al., 2010; Sternquist et al.,
2010). Speciﬁcally, from its series reports on ‘Top 100 retailers in China’, according to ownership structure, 19
foreign retailers were selected. Two foreign fast-food restaurants (i.e. McDonald and Yum) were removed for their
low relevance to the intended focus on retailers. This resulted in 17 foreign retailers (and head ofﬁce locations) as
follows (in order of sales from largest to smallest in 2008): Carrefour (France), RT-Mart (Taiwan), Wal-Mart
(US), Trust-Mart (Taiwan), New World Department Store (NWDS) (Hong Kong), Tesco (UK), Lotus (Thailand),
Metro (Germany), Parkson (Malaysia), Auchan (France), B&Q (UK), Aeon (Japan), PARKnSHOP (Hong Kong),
e-Mart (South Korea), ItoYokado (Japan), IKEA (Sweden) and Home Depot (USA).

The second stage of data collection involved web content analyses of the 17 foreign retailers’ dedicated CSR
websites or CSR reports from the corporate ofﬁcial websites in China. Prior CSR research typically measured
CSR by a single composite score (i.e. a unidimensional construct). However, it is expected that the disaggregation
of the CSR measure to some possible different types would allow for more ﬁne-grained CSR theory development

and provide managerially actionable guidance to retail managers. Thus, unlike a subjective unidimensional CSR
score used in previous CSR research (Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006; Cheung et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010), this
study adopts an objective measurement of CSR, for two reasons. First, despite the warning about ﬁrm’s possible
over-reporting of their CSR using objective measures in their web announcements, web-based CSR announcement
is comparatively more transparent and easier for the public to access and monitor. In China, consumer self-
organised third-party blogs are increasingly validating foreign ﬁrm’s actual fulﬁlment of their CSR against
their donation commitments. Several high-proﬁle foreign ﬁrms have been forced to top-up donation fees as
they received consumer-organised boycotts as a result of dishonest and exaggerated CSR claims. In this sense,
foreign ﬁrms in China are vigilant in reporting their CSR donations on their websites. Second, unlike developed
economies where there are high-quality secondary CSR data sources (e.g. Fortune America’s Most Admired
Corporations), a deﬁciency of high-quality data is a problem in research in China (Cooke, 2008). Considering
the focus of this study is only on global retailers, a purposefully built CSR dataset is actionable for this small
set of retailers.

Following the methods recommended by Lee et al. (2009) in their content analysis of the top 100 US retailers,
the criteria for categorising CSR are simple and straightforward. Primary data collection is also straightforward in
nature by content analysis following the set criteria. As a bilingual researcher (Chinese–English), the author
conducted content analysis, coding, and tracking between proposed theory of 224 web pages for the 17 selected
foreign retailers. CSR scores were collected in monetary terms (i.e. in Chinese RMB). The single-rater method is
advocated particularly for studying social processes when the criteria are simple and research resources are limited
(Humphreys, 2010).

The third stage was to collect ﬁrm performance indicators for the 17 global retailers retrieved from CCFA’s series
of publicly accessible PDF reports on ‘Top 100 retailers in China’ from 2001 to 2009. There are four measures:
store number, store growth rate, sales volume and sales growth rate. In line with the guidance from Diamantopou-
los and Winklhofer (2001), we note that the four measures for retail ﬁrms’ performance do not necessarily co-vary
(e.g. ﬁrms that expand store numbers may not simultaneously achieve sales growth in a short time); we therefore
use formative measures for ﬁrm performance using store number, store growth rate, sales volume and sales growth
rate as four indicators. These four measures were readily available from the CCFA reports. The performance
measures were matched to the 93 ﬁrm-year observations in which global retailers announced government-aimed
and consumer-aimed CSR.

Fourth, two control variables were considered: ﬁrm size and ﬁrm age. According to recommendations of Sheng
et al. (2011), the age of retail ﬁrms was measured by the number of years the ﬁrm has been in operation in China.
Firm size is measured by the natural logarithm of the number of employees of the ﬁrm to prevent skewness. Retail
ﬁrm age were collected from retailers’ ofﬁcial websites in China.

Altogether 93 ﬁrm-year observations from 2001–2009 were collected, matched and compiled. Missing data
occurred in seven cases when retailers only reported either just the government-aimed CSR or the consumer-aimed
CSR. Missing data analysis in PASW statistics 18 (formerly SPSS) was conducted and no signiﬁcant differences on
the dependent variable (i.e. ﬁrm performance) were found. Reporting only one type of CSR is perhaps a signal of
inactive CSR. Thus, these missing data were replaced by ‘mean of nearby points’ rather than ‘average mean’ to
minimize the possible inﬂated scores from CSR active retailers.

Partial Least Squares (PLS) Structural Modelling

PLS was employed in this study in preference to other structural models (e.g. structural equation modelling)
because its advantages ﬁtted this research best. First, in deﬁning government-aimed CSR and consumer-aimed
CSR, single-item formative constructs are used. This is because the direction of causality is from measure (i.e. cash
donation or quantiﬁable product or service donations to government or consumers) to construct (i.e. government-
aimed CSR and consumer-aimed CSR). In addition, as the nature of this study is to explore government-aimed
CSR and consumer-aimed CSR at the current stage in China, the scale scores may not fully and adequately represent
the construct. It is admitted that the measures are not deemed to be exhaustive or complete. It is possible that other
forms of CSR will emerge in the future. These two qualities satisfy the conditions of using formative measures as

suggested by Jarvis et al. (2003). Overall, the use of operationally deﬁned constructs in structural modelling is most
frequently applied in marketing (Bagozzi, 1984).

Analyses

SmartPLS 2.0 M3 (Ringle et al., 2005) was used to conduct the PLS statistical analysis. Reliability for this PLS study
was assessed by means of composite scale reliability (CR) (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Chin, 1998) and average var-
iance extracted (AVE) (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Chin 1998). Government-aimed CSR and consumer-aimed CSR
were measured by a single formative measure, so their CR and AVE were not reported by PLS. In addition, conver-
gent validity was measured by inspecting the standardised loadings of the measures on their respective constructs
(Chin, 1998). Next, the discriminant validity of the measures was assessed. This follows the rule that a construct
should always share more variance with its measures than with other model constructs (Chin, 1998), the square root
of the AVE should be larger than the intercorrelations of the constructs with the other model constructs (Fornell and
Larcker, 1981). The theta matrix (Y) was also examined, and it was conﬁrmed that no item cross-loads more highly
on another construct than on its associated constructs (Chin, 1998). We report the descriptive statistics in Table 3.

Hypothesis Testing
The structural model and hypotheses were tested computing path coefﬁcients.8 A bootstrapping technique using
500 subsamples were performed as recommended by Chin (1998). Speciﬁcally, t-values and the signiﬁcance of
the structural coefﬁcients were computed for each path. In PLS, a model’s ﬁt is assessed by: (i) the coefﬁcient
signiﬁcance of each path, and (ii) the variance explained (R2) in the endogenous fact. Details are reported in
Table 4.

Findings and Discussion

H1 proposes a positive association between retailers’ government-aimed CSR and their retail performance in China.
This path is signiﬁcant at the P < 0.05 level and shows a strong effect (g = 0.244); therefore, H1 is supported. By con-
trast, H2 which suggests that consumer-aimed CSR will also have a positive and direct impact on retailers’
performance in China, turns out to be insigniﬁcant and even shows some negative direction (g = –0.014, n.s.).
For control variables, ﬁrm age shows no signiﬁcant effects on ﬁrm performance. In contrast, ﬁrm size positively

8We used subscripts gamma (g) to signify the causal relationships between two exogenous latent variables (i.e. consumer-aimed CSR and govern-
ment-aimed CSR) and an endogenous latent variable (i.e. ﬁrm performance).

affects ﬁrm performance, suggesting that large ﬁrms are more likely to devote effort to CSR. This ﬁnding is
consistent with prior ﬁndings from (Orlitzky, 2001). Finally, the R2 value of the key endogenous construct of retail
performance is 0.22, which indicates that the model explains a fair amount of variance for retail performance. Given
the R2 of the endogenous factor, together with the statistical signiﬁcance of one of the two g coefﬁcients, it is thus
concluded that the PLS model ﬁts the data well.

Implications and Conclusions

In addressing the paucity of CSR literature from the perspective of developing countries, and particularly to shed
light on the role of a developing country’s government in shaping the CSR agenda, this study draws on relational
governance and institutional theory and proposes and empirically tests two unique types of retailers’ CSR in China:
government-aimed CSR and consumer-aimed CSR. We ﬁnd that under the unique and changing Chinese
economic, social and legal institutions, together with the dual pressures arising from the urgency of retail expansion
to seize the market potential and the expected role of using CSR to contribute to the overall welfare of Chinese
society, foreign retailers have abandoned the mainstream canonical Western CSR stakeholder model, where
interests of employee, community, government and customers must be addressed as a whole. Rather, foreign
retailers adopt a preferential stakeholder model using an actor-speciﬁc CSR strategy, namely, only the government-
aimed CSR and consumer-aimed CSR, to drive their ﬁrm’s performance in China. Data from 17 leading global retailers
for 2001–2009 show that foreign retailers’ government-aimed CSR has a direct and positive effect on their ﬁrm’s
performance in China. We therefore have reason to believe that CSR is perhaps used as a legitimisation tool and a
discretionary means for engaging in the political process to interact, communicate and exchange with key legitimacy
actors, i.e. the Chinese government, as a way to enhance ﬁrm performance.

In contrast, our hypothesised relationship of consumer-aimed CSR has not proved to have any effects on ﬁrm
performance in this study. There could be several reasons for this. First, for global retailers, the effects of
consumer-aimed CSR may be asymmetrical – where doing good does not enhance performance greatly but doing
bad may immediately jeopardise performance. In other words, consumer-aimed CSR may serve more as signal of
a ﬁrm’s goodwill, principally to soothe or appease Chinese consumers’ easily escalated negativity (i.e. boycotts),
or at most a rapport-building gesture rather than an intended strategy for inviting higher consumer spending.
For instance, ItoYokado is a Japanese retailer in China, and overall the Chinese have a low regard for Japanese ﬁrms
for reasons of historical animosity and mutually hostile popular nationalism (Deng, 2008). One of its Beijing stores,
however, offered a free milk delivery service for a disabled elderly lady which was widely acclaimed among shoppers.
This non-monetary effort created very positive word-of-mouth and enhanced ItoYokado’s reputation (China

Business Herald News Weekly, 20089). Although there is no evidence for such CSR leading to a huge ﬁnancial
reward, consumer-aimed CSR for this Japanese retailer had a positive effect on its retail trading environment that
otherwise may not have been the case.

Second, strategically, it is possible that government support for retail expansions such as land use and resources
is more fundamental to foreign retailers’ overall business performance than consumer patronage in shopping as a
way of rewarding ﬁrms’ good citizen behaviour. Retailing is arguably about scale and market reach, thus for a one
unit of CSR donation, the returns from government backing of store expansion could be far greater than the returns
from increased patronage by individual consumers of a certain store.

Overall, given the current climate of retail expansion in China, time limitations drive foreign retailers to actively
transform their CSR duties to comply with the government CSR agenda by way of a purposive CSR construction.
Tellingly, they take CSR as an effective tool to socially construct a conducive environment for their further reach into
the Chinese market. For CSR managers and consultants, results from this study suggest that under the current
business climate (economic, social and legal institutions) in China, only global retailers’ government-aimed CSR
strongly contributes to retail performance, whilst consumer-aimed CSR does not give a ﬁnancial advantage. Yet
our conclusion is subject to revision when Chinese consumers become more sophisticated in the future – they
can become more objective, long-term and evaluate foreign ﬁrms’ CSR from a global citizenship perspective rather
than from a narrow divide of home versus foreign. Strategically, ﬁrms should not immediately abandon their
consumer-aimed CSR just because it generate less ﬁnancial return at this stage, but must keep exchanging CSR
activities with consumers for non-ﬁnancial beneﬁts that have the potential transform to ﬁnancial returns in the future.

Limitations and Future Research

As this study is explorative by nature it suffers from several shortcomings. First, a small sample of global retailers
may not be representative of all foreign retailers in China. However, this is compensated by drawing from the lists
published by CCFA (top 100 retailers in China). In a sense, the selected samples for this study represent high-
performing global retailers. Second, this research explores what constitutes government-aimed and consumer-
aimed CSR by using a single formative construct. This construct only captures quantiﬁable CSR donations in the
form of cash donations of products/services by retailers. Arguably, some other means of CSR donation that are
not calculated on a monetary basis can still contribute greatly to the welfare of society (e.g. free training services
for suppliers on food safety etc.), and are probably signiﬁcant. Thus, more ﬁne-grained quantitative research could
be carried out in optimising the measurement of the two proposed types of CSR. It should also be noted that some
portions of government-aimed CSR may be reallocated and redistributed by government into the consumer domain
on retailers’ behalf. In addition, as public interest has become divided in China in recent years, a code of ethics is
becoming a relative, comparative and qualitative measure rather than purely a subjective, absolute and quantitative
one. Consumer-aimed CSR could be used to manage Chinese consumers’ emotional and behavioural negativity on a
contingent basis. Equally, it is possible that there is an asymmetrical impact of consumer-aimed CSR on perfor-
mance that may need further empirical investigation. Lastly, this study critically assessed the contextual nature of
CSR in the Introduction, and this study is no exception to that. It is restricted to a particular developing Chinese
context, and therefore, ﬁndings on retailers’ CSR on the basis of the proposed typology and effects should not be
applied to other contexts without prudent examination of their applicability.

To conclude, this research contributes to our knowledge of CSR outside the American and European context: in
an emerging country like China, CSR is not modelled after the canonical Western paradigm that address the needs
of the total stakeholder body. Foreign retailers’ perceived societal and stakeholder obligations (Brown and Dacin,
1997) have been adapted according to the speciﬁc Chinese contexts, their CSR, therefore, has been utilised in the
form of a preferential stakeholder model using an actor-speciﬁc CSR strategy for a marked ﬁnancial return.
Government-aimed CSR plays a predominant role in driving the performance of foreign retail ﬁrms in China. This
ﬁnding addresses a prior literature gap concerning knowledge of CSR from a developing agenda and the role of

government in shaping CSR (Idemudia, 2011). In the CSR literature, the prior Western-deﬁned CSR model
ignored the country contingency and there have been no extensive empirical examinations of effects of CSR on?
ﬁrm performance.

As global multinational ﬁrms (retailers included) are gaining momentum in their expansion into emerging
economies like China, countries which often have unique markets and institutional mechanism and distinctive
social concerns and priorities, the understanding of ﬁrms’ strategies and behaviours in shaping the landscape of
international markets and the welfare of overseas consumers is imperative for optimising their business strategies
to suit the environment surrounding them.
