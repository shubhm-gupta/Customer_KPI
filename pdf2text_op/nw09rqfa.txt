Abstract We examine the causal relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR)
and ﬁnancial performance. Consistent with past studies, we ﬁnd that the two variables
appear to be related when we use traditional statistical techniques. However, using a time
series ﬁxed effects approach, we ﬁnd that the relation between CSR and ﬁnancial per-
formance is much weaker than previously thought. We also ﬁnd little evidence of causality
between ﬁnancial performance and narrower measures of social performance that focus on
stakeholder management. Our results suggest that strong stock market performance leads
to greater ﬁrm investment in aspects of CSR devoted to employee relations, but that CSR
activities do not affect ﬁnancial performance. We conclude that CSR is driven more by
unobservable ﬁrm characteristics than by ﬁnancial performance.

1 Introduction

The area of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a notable topic both in the
business and academic press. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) deﬁne CSR as ‘‘actions that
appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the ﬁrm and that which is
required by law,’’ (p. 17). Examples of CSR include support of local businesses or char-
ities, developing recycling programs, and promoting minority employment. Though these
activities certainly result in societal beneﬁts, opinions differ as to whether a ﬁrm’s CSR
activity enhances ﬁnancial performance. For instance, CSR has been described as being

‘‘little more than a cosmetic treatment,’’ (The Good Company 2005) while an earlier article
in the ﬁnancial press touted the economic advantages for companies practicing CSR
(Fittipaldi 2004).

CSR has attracted the attention of mutual fund investors, including TIAA CREF, and a
number of funds use CSR as a screening device for investment selection. However, any
beneﬁts investors derive from including socially responsible ﬁrms in their portfolios do not
appear to be in form of superior returns. Bello (2005) matches socially responsible mutual
funds to conventional funds in the late 1990s and ﬁnds no signiﬁcant difference in long-run
investment performance or portfolio diversiﬁcation between the two groups. According to
Statman (2000), the Domini Social Index (DSI) did as well as the S&P 500 between 1990
and 1998. He ﬁnds that some socially responsible funds performed worse than the S&P 500
and the DSI, but fared no worse than conventional mutual funds during the time period.
Academic research has examined the causal relation between CSR and ﬁnancial
performance—what is sometimes referred to as the ‘‘virtuous circle’’—to determine if
‘‘doing good’’ socially leads to ‘‘doing well’’ ﬁnancially, and whether ﬁrms exhibiting
superior ﬁnancial performance devote more resources to social activities. Why should a
‘‘virtuous circle’’ exist? Waddock and Graves (1997) suggest that positive stakeholder
relationships can reduce the likelihood of difﬁculty when dealing with groups such as
employees, customers, and the community. In addition, good social performance and
good managerial practice may be related, so this in turn may lead to strong ﬁnancial
performance. For instance, Cheng et al. (2006) ﬁnd that ﬁrms with strong shareholder
rights tend to have a lower cost of equity capital than competing ﬁrms, which supports
the idea that reducing agency problems between stakeholders and management improves
ﬁnancial performance. Ferreira et al. (2008) ﬁnd that large ﬁrms beneﬁt in the form of
positive long-run stock performance following certiﬁcation of quality management. This
suggests that in the case of large companies, good managerial practice does indeed
improve the bottom line.

The empirical evidence suggests that a virtuous circle exists. Waddock and Graves
(1997) and Hillman and Keim (2001) ﬁnd that increased CSR leads to enhanced ﬁnancial
performance and vice versa. McGuire et al. (1988) ﬁnd that prior year’s stock returns and
accounting-based performance measures are related to current measures of CSR, but that a
past record of good social performance does not affect the current ﬁnancial performance of
a ﬁrm.

Despite the extensive body of research on CSR and ﬁnancial performance, we believe
that additional analysis is warranted. In this study, we use alternative statistical techniques
to provide new insights on the causal relationship between ﬁrm performance and CSR. The
studies cited above and others on the topic have typically employed ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions with 1-year lagged values of one variable (e.g., CSR) used as deter-
minants of the other (e.g., ROA). Indeed, we also ﬁnd that CSR and performance are
related when we use standard OLS regression models. However, in a time series ﬁxed
effects approach with over 2,800 ﬁrm-year observations, we ﬁnd that the relation between
CSR and ﬁnancial performance is much weaker than that documented in past studies. We
also ﬁnd little evidence of causality between ﬁnancial performance and narrower measures
of social performance. Overall, we ﬁnd weak evidence that strong stock market perfor-
mance leads to greater levels of CSR that focus speciﬁcally on employee relations.
However, CSR activity does not lead to changes in a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance.

This study contributes to the literature on CSR in several ways. We use a more com-
prehensive time-series of CSR data relative to past studies. Also, previous research
analyzing the link between CSR and ﬁnancial performance does not account for possible

persistence or unobservable characteristics that may play a role in the level of CSR activity
undertaken by a ﬁrm. We examine these important considerations by using Granger
causality and controlling for ﬁrm ﬁxed-effects in our time series. We also use a Tobit
speciﬁcation for models of CSR causality to account for the censored nature of the data.
Finally, our speciﬁcations also include analysis of narrow measures of social performance
such as how the company treats employees, the environment, the community, and diversity
issues. The use of appropriate statistical methods and examination of the components of
CSR yield added insights regarding the relation between CSR and ﬁnancial performance.

2 Data and research methods

To measure CSR, we use the KLD Socrates Database.1 This database rates companies on
the various degrees of social responsibility including community participation, diversity,
employee interests, environmental considerations, and shareholder interests. This index is
superior to alternative measures of CSR because it is compiled by an independent rating
service that focuses on a wide range of ﬁrms over a broad spectrum of CSR screens,
whereas alternative measures of CSR focus on a small sample of ﬁrms or use a narrow
CSR screen. Each screen in the KLD database is summarized in terms of strengths
(positive values) and concerns (negative values). For instance, the community screen is
calculated on the basis of strengths, such as generous giving or support for education in the
area, and concerns, such as investment controversies or negative economic impact on the
community.

We calculate a weighted average of the overall index to represent each ﬁrm’s aggregate
level of CSR, using the weights developed by Waddock and Graves (1997). We use these
weights to facilitate comparison of results, and to highlight the effect of a different esti-
mation methodology on statistical inferences. Waddock and Graves calculate weights
using expert panel evaluations on the relative importance of each CSR attribute. Weigh-
tings are as follows: Employee relations: 0.168; Product: 0.154; Community relations:
0.148; Environment: 0.142; Treatment of women and minorities: 0.136; Nuclear power:
0.089; Military contracts: 0.086; South Africa: 0.076. Our sample extends from 1993 to
2000 and includes data on more than 600 U.S. ﬁrms. We assess ﬁnancial performance
using both accounting (return on assets, or ROA) and market-based (common stock
returns) measures from Compustat.

Table 1 presents summary statistics for our measures of CSR and ﬁnancial performance
and control variables. The variable SCORE, which is the sum of the individual scores for
the various CSR strengths and concerns, ranges from -11 (indicating signiﬁcant concerns)
to +11 (indicating signiﬁcant strengths), with a median value of zero. The minimum
WSCORE, which represents the weighted average measure of CSR for each ﬁrm, is -1.07
with a maximum value of +1.74. We then create narrower CSR scores by summing the
scores in four categories of the KLD index: community, diversity, employee relations, and
environment. The median value for each is zero. The lowest minimum score is for total
environment score at -5 while the highest maximum score is diversity at 7. Panel B
presents data on the values of SCORE by industry. Not surprisingly, signiﬁcantly negative
averages appear in the tobacco industry (average = -2.08), the mining industry (aver-
age = -1.54), and the transportation industry (average = -1.43). The largest positive
average (1.02) exists in the retail trade industry, possibly because these ﬁrms stand to

This table presents data on corporate social responsibility (from the KLD Socrates Database) and ﬁnancial
performance over the period 1993–2000. Panel A represents the whole sample, and Panel B provides
statistics on the social responsibility by industry. CSR SCORE is the sum of the component scores in the
KLD Socrates Database, and WSCORE is the weighted average

beneﬁt the most from the positive association their customers may attribute to the ﬁrm’s
CSR activity.

In Table 2, we report the correlation matrix for the sample of ﬁrms used in this study. In
particular, we are interested in the correlations between WSCORE and measures of
ﬁnancial performance. In the ﬁrst column of Table 2, we see that WSCORE is positively
correlated with contemporaneous ROA and annual stock returns and negatively correlated
with leverage (long-term debt divided by total assets). There is no signiﬁcant correlation
between WSCORE and ﬁrm size, measured by total assets or sales. This simple correlation
analysis does not address issues of causality, but provides initial evidence that CSR and
ﬁnancial performance are directly related. We use traditional regression analysis in our
initial examination of the causal relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance. We
then argue that ordinary least-squares regressions cannot adequately assess causality issues,
and introduce Granger causality models and Tobit regressions to examine the relationship
in greater detail. Furthermore, using a panel dataset of a large cross-section of ﬁrms over a

3 Results

3.1 Results of OLS models

Panel A of Table 3 presents results of OLS regression models similar to those in
Waddock and Graves (1997) with the weighted social responsibility score in year t as the
dependent variable. The primary independent variable is ﬁnancial performance in year
t - 1, measured either by return on assets or the return on the ﬁrm’s common stock.
Sales, total assets, and debt-to-assets in year t - 1 are included as controls for ﬁrm size
and leverage. In general, we ﬁnd that the relationship between social responsibility and
lagged ﬁnancial performance is positive and signiﬁcant, similar to what is reported by
Waddock and Graves (1997). Leverage is negative and signiﬁcant in each model, sug-
gesting that ﬁrms with a higher proportion of debt ﬁnancing exhibit lower levels of CSR.
The coefﬁcients on lagged ROA and lagged stock returns (in Panel A) are all positive
and signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Coefﬁcients on the size control variables (sales and total
assets) are positive, suggesting that larger ﬁrms may have greater resources available to
support CSR efforts.

Panel B of Table 3 presents the results of models with ﬁnancial performance—ROA
and annual stock returns—as the dependent variable. In each of the models (5)–(8) in
Table 3, the coefﬁcient on the lagged weighted CSR score is positive and signiﬁcant. This
result, consistent with that of Waddock and Graves (1997), implies that a ﬁrm’s level of
CSR activity contributes to its ﬁnancial performance.

In summary, the OLS regression results presented in Table 1 suggest that a ‘‘virtuous
circle’’ exists, linking a ﬁrm’s level of CSR with its ﬁnancial performance. In the sections
below, we introduce alternative estimation methods that may be more appropriate than
OLS for the analysis.

3.2 Results of ﬁxed effects models

Previous studies of the relationship between ﬁnancial performance and social responsibility
have failed to control for unobservable characteristics in panel data that differ between
ﬁrms but are constant over time. For example, variables such as corporate culture or
managerial inﬂuence may be signiﬁcant determinants of CSR activity. Using a ﬁxed effects
regression model allows us to estimate the effects of the independent variables on the
dependent variable while controlling for the effect of unobserved variables.

The results of our ﬁxed effects models are presented in Table 4 and they reveal
interesting differences compared to the OLS regression results presented in Table 3. A
ﬁrm’s past ﬁnancial performance as measured by ROA continues to be a signiﬁcant
determinant of CSR score—i.e., ROA and CSR are positively related. However, as
noted in Models (3) and (4), a ﬁrm’s past stock return is no longer a signiﬁcant
determinant of its CSR score. Furthermore, the weighted CSR score is no longer a
signiﬁcant predictor of ﬁnancial performance, as seen in Models (5)–(8) in Panel B of
Table 4. These results suggest that by controlling for ﬁrm ﬁxed effects, the relationship
between CSR and ﬁnancial performance is not as strong as previously reported in the
literature.

3.3 Results of Granger causality models

The regression results presented above in Table 3 suggest a link between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance. An interesting question arises as to the nature of causality, if any,
between doing ‘‘good’’ through greater CSR activity and doing ‘‘well’’ ﬁnancially. Does
good ﬁnancial performance cause a ﬁrm to become more socially responsible, or does a
high level of CSR lead to subsequent superior ﬁnancial performance? Good ﬁnancial
performance may result in more resources being available for the pursuit of CSR goals. A
high level of CSR may attract
the attention of investors or customers or motivate
employees to perform better and reduce costs, boosting ﬁnancial performance. Another
possibility is that a ‘‘virtuous circle’’ exists, and the causality runs in both directions.

We address the link between ﬁnancial performance and CSR in the context of Granger
causality. This approach, developed by Granger (1969), involves regression models of the
form

SCOREt ¼ a0 þ a1SCOREt 1 þ a2PERFt þ a3PERFt 1 þ et
PERFt ¼ b0 þ b1PERFt 1 þ b2SCOREt þ b3SCOREt 1 þ et

where SCOREt, and SCOREt-1 represent a ﬁrm’s CSR score in year t and t - 1, PERFt and
PERFt-1 represent a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance in year t and t - 1, and et is an error term.

E. Nelling, E. Webb

If the coefﬁcients a2 or a3 are signiﬁcantly different from zero, we conclude that
ﬁnancial performance ‘‘Granger causes’’ social responsibility. Similarly, if coefﬁcients b2
or b3 are signiﬁcant, we infer causality from CSR to ﬁnancial performance. (For ease in
exposition, we will omit the word ‘‘Granger’’ from subsequent discussion, reminding the
reader that all uses of the words ‘‘cause’’ or ‘‘causality’’ refer speciﬁcally to ‘‘Granger
causality.’’)

Before discussing our results, a comment on model speciﬁcation is in order. The typical
problem that arises in OLS regression when lagged dependent variables are included as
regressors is serial correlation in the error term, rendering the parameter estimates biased
and inconsistent. We test for this using the method of Maddala (1971) and ﬁnd that serial
correlation is not a problem in our model.

First, we present models of causality using ordinary least squares (without controlling
for ﬁrm ﬁxed effects). The results of these speciﬁcations are presented in Table 5, and
differ widely from those reported in Table 3. The results in Panel A indicate a strong
relationship between past CSR performance and current CSR, but ROA is not a signiﬁcant
determinant of CSR. The signiﬁcance of the relationship between stock returns and CSR is
weaker than reported in Table 3 (with a t-statistic of 1.93 versus 3.74). Results presented in
Panel B indicate that ﬁrms do not ‘‘do well’’ by ‘‘doing good’’—CSR activity is not

causally related to contemporaneous or subsequent ﬁnancial performance. The explanatory
power of these models with the CSR score (R2 = 0.78) or return on assets (R2 = 0.42) is
signiﬁcantly larger than that of the OLS regressions in Table 3. The increase is mainly due
to the inclusion of lagged values of the dependent variable in each model.

3.4 Results of Granger causality models with ﬁxed effects

We next incorporate both ﬁxed effects and Granger causality in our models using the CSR
score and ﬁnancial performance as dependent variables. Speciﬁcally, the model now
includes n intercepts (where n is the number of ﬁrms in the panel dataset) that are rep-
resented by a set of indicator variables, such that:

SCOREt ¼ a0 þ a1SCOREt 1 þ a2PERFt þ a3PERFt 1 þ ai þ et
PERFt ¼ b0 þ b1PERFt 1 þ b2SCOREt þ b3SCOREt 1 þ ai þ et

where ai = b0 + b1Zi, and Zi represents the unobserved variable that varies from one ﬁrm
to another, but does not change over time. The variables a1,…, an are treated as unknown
intercepts to be estimated, one for each ﬁrm. In this model, the errors et are assumed to be
uncorrelated over time, conditional on the independent variables.

The results of the causality speciﬁcations using ﬁrm ﬁxed effects are presented in
Table 6, and corroborate those of our causality models presented earlier. In Panel A, CSR
scores are highly persistent over time. We ﬁnd a positive and signiﬁcant relationship
between CSR score and lagged return on assets, which differs from the causality model
presented without ﬁxed effects in Table 5. However, this causal relationship disappears
when stock returns are used as the measure of ﬁnancial performance.

The results from the causality ﬁxed effects models using ﬁnancial performance as the
dependent variable are presented in Panel B of Table 6. Both the lagged return on assets
and lagged stock returns are signiﬁcantly related to current return on assets and stock
returns, respectively. More importantly, the coefﬁcients on current and lagged WSCORE
are not signiﬁcant. This implies that, using a ﬁxed effects causality model speciﬁcation,
CSR does not contribute to better ﬁnancial performance.

In additional robustness tests, we repeat the analyses in Panel A of Tables 5 and 6
using a Tobit speciﬁcation when WSCORE is the dependent variable to account for its
censored nature. The results, which are not reported here, are very similar to those
reported above.

4 Narrowing the deﬁnition of social responsibility

Harrison and Freeman (1999) note that research on CSR has over time focused more on
speciﬁc measures of social responsibility, and less on the aggregate social performance
measure. For instance, Hillman and Keim (2001) separate social performance into two
components: stakeholder management and social issue participation. Primary stakeholders
include shareholders, employees, and customers, and they ﬁnd that this measure is directly
related to shareholder value creation. However, social issue participation, which refers to
the use of corporate resources for social issues outside ﬁrm strategy such as avoidance of
nuclear energy, refraining from alcohol, tobacco, and gambling industries, etc., is nega-
tively related to changes in shareholder wealth. Fisman et al. (2005) focus speciﬁcally on
CSR that is targeted towards the community in a study on industry variability in CSR.

They justify the use of this measure as it is the most prominent element of CSR, and
suggest that activities directed towards the community can be used as a means of differ-
entiation by ﬁrms in competitive industries. They ﬁnd that the community CSR measure is
positively related to proﬁtability in advertising-intensive industries.

We test the relationship between ﬁnancial performance and speciﬁc aspects of CSR
using individual factors in the KLD database rather than the weighted average CSR score.
The KLD database rates companies on eight different screens of social responsibility. Each
screen focuses on ‘‘strengths’’ and ‘‘concerns’’ of a particular social indicator. We create
separate ‘‘stakeholder management’’ scores for community, diversity, employee relations,
and environment by adding up the number of strengths listed in each category and sub-
tracting out the total number of weaknesses. By doing this, we can analyze the causal
relationship between ﬁnancial performance and speciﬁc indicators of CSR rather than the
overall CSR score.

The results of the causality models with this narrower deﬁnition of social performance
are presented in Tables 7 and 8. Speciﬁcally, we analyze the following regression models
substituting score indicators of community, diversity, employee relations, and environment
for SRPERF:

This table reports the results of ﬁxed effects causality models with Tobit speciﬁcations when the dependent
variable is a ﬁrm’s community (COMM) or diversity (DIV) score. RET is the ﬁrm’s annual common stock
return. T-statistics are in parentheses. *, **, *** indicates signiﬁcance at the .10, .05, .01 levels, respectively

SRPERFt ¼ a0 þ a1SRPERFt 1 þ a2SRPERFt 2 þ a3RETt þ a4RETt 1 þ ai þ et
RETt ¼ b0 þ b1RETt 1 þ b2RETt 2 þ b3SRPERFt þ b4SRPERFt 1 þ ai þ et

where RET represents the ﬁrm’s annual common stock returns. We use Tobit models when
each CSR score is used as the dependent variable. Upper and lower limits on the censored
variable are the maximum and minimum CSR score.2

We present ﬁxed effects causality models for community (COMM) and diversity (DIV)
scores in Table 7. Similar to the broader deﬁnition of CSR used earlier, we ﬁnd strong
persistence in both narrow measures of CSR. The coefﬁcients on lagged community and
diversity score are positive and signiﬁcant. However, current and lagged annual stock
returns are not signiﬁcantly related to these CSR measures. Also, when stock returns are
used as the dependent variable, the coefﬁcients on current and lagged community and
diversity scores are statistically insigniﬁcant, suggesting no evidence of causality running
from these narrow measures of CSR to ﬁnancial performance.

In Table 8 we repeat the procedure using employee relations (EMP) and environment
(ENV) score as the CSR measures. Again, we observe positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcients
on lagged CSR scores, indicating persistence in the employee and environmental dimen-
sions of CSR. We also note that past ﬁnancial performance is a positive and signiﬁcant
determinant of the employee relation score. That is, as stock returns increase, CSR, as
measured by employee relations, also increases. Firms can increase their employee relation
score by, for instance, having strong retirement beneﬁts, employee involvement (in the
form of widespread employee options or cash proﬁt sharing), and having a strong record of
employee safety and general well-being. In contrast, we ﬁnd no evidence of causality
running from stock returns to a ﬁrm’s environmental score. In the models with stock
returns as the dependent variable, the coefﬁcients on current and lagged employee relations
scores are insigniﬁcant, and the coefﬁcient on the current environmental score is signiﬁcant

2 The upper and lower limits for the CSR scores are the following: community (-2, 4), diversity (-2, 7),
employee relations (-3, 4), and environment (-5, 3).

5 Conclusions

A number of studies have examined the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance, and most have found that the two characteristics are directly related. In this paper,
we analyze the existence and direction of causality between CSR and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance by using a more comprehensive data set and an improved statistical methodology.
We use the KLD index as the measure of CSR, and both return on assets and stock
returns to assess ﬁnancial performance. First, we analyze causality using standard OLS
regression analysis, similar to past research. Our results are consistent with the existing
literature in that past ﬁnancial performance is signiﬁcant in explaining variability in CSR,
and that CSR is signiﬁcant in explaining variability in ﬁnancial performance.

However, when we introduce panel ﬁxed effects into the model, the results no longer
suggest a strong relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance. We further examine
the link between CSR and ﬁnancial performance using Granger causality models. Results
here again demonstrate the weakened evidence of a relationship between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance. However, there is some evidence that stock returns cause CSR
performance. We then introduce both panel ﬁxed effects and Tobit models in the causality
model speciﬁcation. We ﬁnd no causality from CSR to ﬁnancial performance, and only
weak evidence of causality running from stock returns to a ﬁrm’s CSR score. Finally, we
examine the relation between ﬁnancial performance and stakeholder-speciﬁc measures of
CSR. We ﬁnd that higher stock returns lead to higher employee relations scores, but ﬁnd no
evidence of causality between stock returns and aspects of CSR related to the community,
diversity, or environment.

In summary, CSR and ﬁnancial performance appear to be related when using traditional
OLS regression models. However, this ‘‘virtuous circle’’ is found to be much weaker when
examined using a ﬁxed effects Granger causality approach. There is no evidence that CSR

affects a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance, and the only aspect of CSR driven by stock market
performance is employee relations. If socially responsible activities provide beneﬁts to the
ﬁrm, they appear to manifest themselves in forms unrelated to ﬁnancial performance.
