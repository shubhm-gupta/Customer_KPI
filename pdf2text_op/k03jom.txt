Abstract

Recent research on total quality management (TQM) has examined the relationships between the practices of quality
management and various levels of organizational performance. These studies have produced mixed results, probably because of
the nature of the research designs used such as measuring TQM or performance as a single construct. Based on a comprehensive
literature review, this study identiﬁes the relationships among TQM practices and examines the direct and indirect effects of
these practices on various performance levels. A proposed research model and hypotheses are tested by using cross-sectional
mail survey data collected from ﬁrms operating in the US. The test of the structural model supports the proposed hypotheses.
The implications of the ﬁndings for researchers and practitioners are discussed and further research directions are offered.

1. Introduction

The barnyard rooster Chanticleer had a theory. He
crowed every morning, putting forth all his energy,
ﬂapped his wings. The sun came up. The connex-
ion was clear: His crowing caused the sun to come
up. There was no question about his importance.
There came a snag. He forgot one morning to crow.
The sun came up anyhow. Crestfallen, he saw his
theory in need of revision.

the competitive edge, companies began to adopt pro-
ductivity improvement programs which had proven
themselves particularly successful in Japan. One of
these “improvement programs” was the total quality
management (TQM) system. In last two decades, both
the popular press and academic journals have pub-
lished a plethora of accounts describing both success-
ful and unsuccessful efforts at implementing TQM.
Like Chanticleer’s theory, theories of quality manage-
ment have been under revision ever since.

The early stages of empirical research in TQM
have been almost exclusively limited to attempts at
constructing instruments capable of measuring TQM
practices as, for example, Saraph et al. (1989) have
done, and with studies such as Garvin’s (1983) that
compare TQM practices in Japanese and US ﬁrms.
More recently, scholars like Mohrman et al. (1995)
have channeled their research efforts into analyzing

the relationship between practices of quality manage-
ment and organizational performance on various lev-
els. Recent studies such as the one conducted by Das
et al. (2000) have started investigating both the rela-
tionships among techniques of quality management
systems and the effects they have on performance.

These studies have produced mixed results. This
failure to obtain consistent results could be due to
three signiﬁcant differences among studies in terms
of research design issues. First, in some studies such
as the one conducted by Douglas and Judge (2001),
TQM is operationalized as a single construct to ana-
lyze the relationship between TQM and ﬁrms’ perfor-
mance, while others, Samson and Terziovski (1999)
for instance, operationalize TQM as a multidimen-
sional construct. Second, the levels of performance
measured vary among the studies. Some studies op-
erationalize performance only at operating levels as
Samson and Terziovski (1999) do, while others like
Douglas and Judge (2001) measure only ﬁnancial
performance; and still others as do Das et al. (2000),
measure performance at multiple levels. Third, the
analytical framework used to investigate the relation
between TQM and performance also differs among
the studies. In other words, when the data analyses
are based on a series of multiple regressions (Adam
et al., 1997; Mohrman et al., 1995; Samson and
Terziovski, 1999) or correlations (Powell, 1995), the
studies fall short of investigating which TQM prac-
tices have direct and/or indirect effects on various
levels of performance. In short, comprehensive stud-
ies trying to identify the direct and indirect effects of
TQM practices on performance at multiple levels are
rather limited and fail to respond conclusively to the
following research questions:
• What are the relationships among TQM practices?
• Which TQM practices are directly related to oper-
• Which TQM practices are indirectly related to op-

ating, market and ﬁnancial performance?

erating, market and ﬁnancial performance?

This study investigates these research questions by
using the data from Kaynak’s (1997) study. This re-
search contributes to the development of TQM theory
by investigating the relationships between seven qual-
ity management practices and their effects on oper-
ating, ﬁnancial, and market performance. While this
study does replicate some earlier research, it is unique

in that the dimensions of the quality management prac-
tices investigated are extensive and ﬁrms’ performance
is measured at multiple levels. Replication research fa-
cilitates the goal of science, which is empirical gener-
alization or knowledge development (Hubbard et al.,
1998), and it is recommended in cases such as this
“where different studies produced inconsistent results”
(Amundson, 1998, p. 355). This research is relevant to
practitioners because the ﬁndings may reveal patterns
in the implementation of TQM practices, which may
provide signiﬁcant information managers can use to
solve implementation challenges and perhaps to im-
prove performance. Moreover, the results of this study
may provide support for continued implementation of
TQM. The unsuccessful attempts have prompted crit-
icisms of TQM in the popular press and caused some
managers who might otherwise have had an interest
in implementing TQM to question the wisdom of uti-
lizing this management approach. But this, to quote
an old but still relevant cliché, is throwing out the
baby with the bath water. The remainder of this pa-
per is organized as follows. A research model and re-
lated hypotheses are offered based on the review of
the literature in the next section. Section 3 describes
the research methodology, including the construction
of the instrument and measures, the survey procedure,
the sample, and the tests for reliability and validity.
Section 4 presents the results of testing the structural
model. The implications of the results for researchers
and practitioners are discussed and validity of ﬁndings
is reevaluated in Section 5. The paper concludes with
further research implications of this study.

2. Theoretical background

TQM can be deﬁned as a holistic management phi-
losophy that strives for continuous improvement in all
functions of an organization, and it can be achieved
only if the total quality concept is utilized from the
acquisition of resources to customer service after the
sale. TQM practices have been documented exten-
sively in measurement studies as well as in the studies
that have investigated the relation of TQM practices to
various dependent variables. The TQM practices iden-
tiﬁed in measurement studies by Saraph et al. (1989)
and those who have followed their example are sum-
marized in Table 1.

A close examination of Table 1 shows that each
instrument has some limitations and some strengths.
As a part of her research, Kaynak (1997) used Saraph
et al.’s (1989) survey instrument for most of the items
to assess the implementation of TQM in 382 man-
ufacturing and service ﬁrms operating in the United
States because the nature of her study was closer
to that of Saraph et al. (1989) than it was to the
other TQM measurement studies available. The re-
sults of reliability tests and factor analysis showed
the same pattern Saraph et al. (1989) found in their
study. (The instrument will be discussed further in
Section 3.) Because the data from Kaynak’s (1997)
study are used in this study, the seven TQM techniques
investigated here are the same as in Saraph et al.’s
(1989) study: management leadership, training, em-
ployee relations, quality data and reporting, supplier
quality management, product/service design, and pro-
cess management. These techniques are described in
Table 1. The scale of Role of the Quality Department
is not included in this study because 105 organiza-
tions of the 382 did not have a quality department.
The summary of studies on the relationship between
TQM techniques and ﬁrms’ performance is presented
in Table 2. A review of TQM techniques investigated
in these studies shows that the seven techniques of
TQM used in this study represent a wide domain of
TQM.

Based on the strategic management, market-
ing, and operations management literature, Kaynak
(1997)
identiﬁed and validated three dimensions
of ﬁrms’ performance relevant to TQM. Financial
and market performance indicators include return
on investment (ROI), sales growth, proﬁt growth,
market share, and market share growth. The indi-
cators for quality performance are product/service
quality, productivity, cost of scrap and rework, de-
livery lead-time of purchased materials, and delivery
lead-time of ﬁnished products/services to customers.
Two indicators of
inventory management perfor-
mance are purchased material
turnover and total
inventory turnover. The same three dimensions of
ﬁrms’ performance Kaynak (1997) used in her pre-
vious study are used in this study, and these are
consistent with the measurement of performance in
the other studies on the relationship between quality
management and ﬁrm performance, as presented in
Table 2.

2.1. The research model and proposed hypotheses

Because of the inconsistent results, the main ﬁnd-
ings of the studies summarized in Table 2 do not really
provide a plausible research model for identifying the
direct and indirect effects of TQM practices on the di-
mensions of performance, though, as Mohrman et al.
(1995) remind us, “Most of the TQM practices are re-
lated to one form of performance improvement or the
other” (p. 39). However, the ﬁndings of the studies
in which TQM has been operationalized as a multidi-
mensional construct and in which indirect and direct
effects of TQM practices on performance are investi-
gated (e.g. Das et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al.,
2001) indicate that the infrastructural TQM practices
such as top management leadership, training, and em-
ployee relations affect performance through core TQM
practices such as quality data and reporting, supplier
quality management, product/service design, and pro-
cess management.

Given the limited amount of literature on the re-
search questions investigated in this study, the hy-
potheses pertaining to the relationships suggested in
the research model (see Fig. 1) are drawn from studies
in the literature on organizational change and opera-
tions management in addition to quality management
literature. Each path in Fig. 1 is labeled with the asso-
ciated hypothesis, and all are discussed in the follow-
ing sections.

2.1.1. Management leadership

As documented by quality gurus (e.g. Deming,
1986; Juran, 1986), and the studies summarized in
Tables 1 and 2, management leadership is an important
factor in TQM implementation because it improves
performance by inﬂuencing other TQM practices
(Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Anderson et al.,
1995; Flynn et al., 1995; Wilson and Collier, 2000).
Successful implementation of TQM requires effective
change in an organization’s culture, and it is almost
impossible to change an organization without a con-
centrated effort by management aimed at continuous
improvement, open communication, and cooperation
throughout the value chain (Abraham et al., 1999;
Adebanjo and Kehoe, 1999; Bell and Burnham, 1989;
Choi, 1995; Daft, 1998; Ettkin et al., 1990; Goodstein
and Burke, 1991; Hamlin et al., 1997; Handﬁeld and
Ghosh, 1994; Ho et al., 1999; Zeitz et al., 1997).

Main ﬁndings

Employee fulﬁllment has a signiﬁcant
direct effect on customer satisfaction. No
signiﬁcant relationship exists between
continuous improvement and customer
satisfaction.

Statistical control/feedback and the product
design process have positive effects on
perceived quality market outcomes while
the process ﬂow management and
statistical control/feedback are signiﬁcantly
related to internal measure of the percent
that passed ﬁnal inspection without
requiring rework. Both perceived quality
market outcomes and percent-passed ﬁnal
inspection with no rework have signiﬁcant
effects on competitive advantage.

There is a signiﬁcant and positive relation
between the extent of TQM adoption and
efﬁciency of employee and capital
utilization. The relationship of TQM to
manufacturing costs and inventory turnover
is not signiﬁcant. Although core TQM
practices and market share are signiﬁcantly
related for manufacturing ﬁrms, no
signiﬁcant relationships are found between
TQM adoption and ﬁnancial performance.

performance. A zero-defects mentality and
closeness to suppliers correlate
signiﬁcantly with TQM performance, but
with total performance only marginally.

Implementing an effective TQM program
improves performance of ﬁrms.

Employee knowledge about quality
improvement, what quality customers
receive and perceive, employee
compensation and recognition and
management involvement are signiﬁcantly
and inversely correlated with total cost of
quality and average per cent of items
defective. Financial performance is
positively correlated with senior
management involvement and employee
compensation and recognition.

The relation between TQM and
performance is stronger when
manufacturing performance measures are
used as a part of managerial evaluation.

Financial performance is a function of
operating performance while operating
performance is a function of continuous
improvement. Customer focus has a
signiﬁcant effect on product/service
quality. Employee fulﬁllment, cooperation
and customer focus positively impact
customer satisfaction.

TQM practices have a stronger effect on
customer satisfaction than they do on plant
performance. The plant performance has no
signiﬁcant effect on customer satisfaction.

Firms with high top management
commitment produce higher quality
products than those with low top
management commitment. Customer focus,
supplier quality management and
empowerment emerge as signiﬁcant
predictors of product quality.

For the ﬁrms adopting TQM, ﬁnancial
performance has increased.

Fig. 1. Theoretical model of the relationship between TQM practices and performance measures.

Management has a complex leadership role when
implementing TQM. It is impossible to improve any
organization’s operations without a well-trained work-
force. It is management that provides the resources
necessary for training employees in the use of new
principles and tools, and creates a work environment
conducive to employee involvement in the process of
change (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Anderson
et al., 1995; Bell and Burnham, 1989; Burack et al.,
1994; Daft, 1998; Flynn et al., 1995; Hamlin et al.,
1997; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Ho et al., 1999; Schroeder
et al., 1989; Wilson and Collier, 2000). And top man-
agement must ensure that the necessary resources
for quality-related training are available (Ahire
and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Anderson et al., 1995;
Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Ho et al.,
1999).

But it takes more than training to guarantee efﬁcient
and successful change. Employees must be involved
in the process of change, a crucial factor according

to Adebanjo and Kehoe (1999), and this involvement
is effected by creating a work environment that en-
courages and facilitates open communication. In such
an environment, workers are apt to work harder and
contribute ideas that both facilitate and enhance the
change process (Anderson et al., 1995; Burack et al.,
1994; Das et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld
et al., 1998; Spector and Beer, 1994). Involving em-
ployees requires communicating a clear strategy for
improving quality to them, and this function can be
enhanced by instituting quality-based incentive and
compensation procedures (Bonito, 1990; Flynn et al.,
1995). Thus, the literature discussed above leads to
the following hypotheses:

H1a. Management leadership is positively related to
training.

H1b. Management leadership is positively related to
employee relations.


H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435

415

Effective leadership is also critical

to effecting
organizational changes—especially in purchasing—
that improve interactions with supply chain members
(Cooper and Ellram, 1993). To promote mutually
beneﬁcial relations with suppliers, management can,
and probably should, privilege quality and delivery
performance over price when selecting suppliers and
certifying suppliers for material quality (Flynn et al.,
1995; Trent and Monczka, 1999). Managing supplier
relationships strategically is essential to the success
of organization–supplier relationships because these
partnerships require both a high level of commitment
and an exchange of proprietary and competitive infor-
mation (Ellram, 1991). Consequently, the following
hypothesis is proposed:

H1c. Management leadership is positively related to
supplier quality management.

Last, but not the least, management must be re-
sponsible for focusing product design on market and
consumer needs (Deming, 1986; Flynn et al., 1995;
Garvin, 1987; Shetty, 1988). This sharp focus is crucial
to developing products that are manufacturable and
meet the needs of the customers (Flynn et al., 1995;
Hackman and Wageman, 1995; Juran, 1981; Leonard
and Sasser, 1982). Thus, we are led to the following
hypothesis:

H1d. Management leadership is positively related to
product design.

2.1.2. Training

In the literature (e.g. Bell and Burnham, 1989;
Choi, 1995; Daft, 1998; Ettkin et al., 1990), employee
training is clearly identiﬁed as a critical component of
workforce management when implementing signiﬁ-
cant changes in an organization. If it is to be effective,
i.e. transform employees into creative problem solvers,
training in quality-related issues should emphasize
problem solving in small groups, effective commu-
nication, and statistical process control (Flynn et al.,
1994). Workforce training in the techniques necessary
for improving processes must be continuous if the
improvement effort is to be sustained, for an ongoing
training program will help employees discover inno-
vative ways to improve the organization (Choi, 1995)
and shoulder more of the responsibility for effecting

improvements (Adebanjo and Kehoe, 1999; Ho et al.,
1999). The authors of several studies (Bonito, 1990;
Daft, 1998; Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Forza and
Flippini, 1998; Hackman and Wageman, 1995; Holpp,
1994) argue forcefully that the number of skills em-
ployees need to be productive workers is correlated
positively with the level of engagement employees
have with their jobs. It would seem reasonable, then,
to expect that an increase in training will produce a
corresponding increase in employee involvement with
their jobs and in increased awareness of quality-related
issues. Thus, we have the following hypothesis:

H2a. Training is positively related to employee rela-
tions.

To manage quality, employees must effectively
measure and make use of quality data in a timely
manner, and to do this they need to be trained in the
use of quality improvement tools (Ahire and Dreyfus,
2000; Ho et al., 1999). Training and employee rela-
tions (the latter is discussed in the following section)
has a positive effect on quality, which is mediated
through quality data and reporting (Ho et al., 2001).
Collecting and using quality data are impossible with-
out training, but training alone will not sustain an
improvement effort: employees must receive quality
data in a timely manner and use it effectively. Thus,
the following hypothesis is suggested:

H2b. Training is positively related to quality data and
reporting.

2.1.3. Employee relations

The employee relations investigated in this study en-
compass a variety of organizational development (OD)
techniques to facilitate changes such as employee
participation in decisions (Bell and Burnham, 1989;
Burack et al., 1994; Choi, 1995; Daft, 1998; Ford and
Fottler, 1995; Holpp, 1994), employee recognition
(Daft, 1998; Ford and Fottler, 1995), teamwork (Bell
and Burnham, 1989; Daft, 1998; Ford and Fottler,
1995; Holpp, 1994), and the use of effective com-
munications to create an awareness of organizational
goals (Bell and Burnham, 1989; Daft, 1998; Ford
and Fottler, 1995). These OD techniques, generally
considered the most relevant human resource prac-
tices in organizations that make effective use of TQM


416

H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435

techniques, are identiﬁed by the studies summarized
in Tables 1 and 2.

Empirical results also support the assertion that em-
ployee relations are directly related to quality data and
reporting (Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al., 1999, 2001).
This result is not surprising because effective mea-
surement, availability, and use of quality data require
continuous awareness of quality-related issues in em-
ployees who have a signiﬁcant role in quality deci-
sions. Generally speaking, these decisions contribute
to improvement only when they are based on accurate
quality data (Ho et al., 1999). Thus, we can suggest
the following hypothesis:

H3. Employee relations is positively related to quality
data and reporting.

2.1.4. Quality data and reporting

Quality data and reporting involve using costs of
poor quality such as rework, scrap and warranty costs,
and control charts to identify quality problems and
provide information on areas of possible improvement
(Choi, 1995; Ho et al., 1999; Lockamy, 1998). The
positive effect of quality data and reporting on ﬁrm
performance is through three other TQM techniques:
supplier quality management, product/service design,
and process management.

Managing supplier quality entails monitoring and
assessing the performance of suppliers through the
creation of a supplier performance measurement
database, a tool crucial to enhancing material quality,
reducing development costs, purchase prices, and im-
proving supplier responsiveness (Krause et al., 1998).
With this database companies can accurately track
such quality measures as parts-per-million defective,
reliability, process capability ratios, and percent parts
rejected (Forza and Flippini, 1998; Krause et al.,
1998; Trent and Monczka, 1999) as well as on-time
delivery performance and percent of incoming ma-
terials acceptable (Tan et al., 1998). In conjunction
with supplier performance databases, availability,
costs of quality, and control charts help employees
and managers identify and solve problems stemming
from supplied materials and parts. Suppliers can be
provided the information they need to improve their
performance (Adebanjo and Kehoe, 1999). Thus, we
can propose the following hypothesis:

H4a. Quality data and reporting is positively related
to supplier quality management.

Companies implementing TQM emphasize building
quality into the product rather than inspecting quality
into the ﬁnished product and removing defective prod-
ucts (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Flynn et al.,
1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Tan, 2001). Because
product design requires such a wide range of informa-
tion, design teams are comprised of people from pur-
chasing, design, production, suppliers and customers
(Flynn et al., 1995; Lockamy, 1998). Design manage-
ment tools—design for manufacturability, concurrent
engineering, quality function deployment, and design
for experiments (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Easton and
Jarrell, 1998; Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Ho et al., 1999)—
can be used effectively only if quality data are col-
lected and disseminated throughout the organization
in a timely manner. Thus, the following hypothesis is
proposed:

H4b. Quality data and reporting is positively related
to product/service design.

Quality data directly affect process management
by informing workers about changes in processes
immediately so they can take corrective actions be-
fore defective products are produced and then check
the results of their improvement efforts (Flynn et al.,
1995; Ho et al., 1999). The effectiveness of using sta-
tistical process control charts and process capability
studies in process improvement is well established in
the literature (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Flynn
et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1999). Therefore, we
can propose the following hypothesis:

H4c. Quality data and reporting is positively related
to process management.

2.1.5. Supplier quality management

Effective supplier quality management is facilitated
by long-term, cooperative relationships with as few
suppliers as possible to obtain quality materials and/or
services. Maintaining a small number of suppliers im-
proves product quality and productivity of buyers by
encouraging enhanced supplier commitment to prod-
uct design and quality (Ansari and Modarress, 1990;
Burt, 1989; Trent and Monczka, 1999). Additionally,


H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435

417

dealing with a small number of suppliers facilitates
the solution of quality and delivery problems because
buyers can pay close attention to each supplier (Burt,
1989; Cooper and Ellram, 1993). Successful relation-
ships encourage suppliers to become involved in the
buying ﬁrm’s design of products/services, and gives
them a chance to offer suggestions regarding product
and/or component simpliﬁcation. They can also help
purchasers procure the materials and parts that can be
used most efﬁciently (Burt, 1989; Flynn et al., 1995;
Forza and Flippini, 1998; Shin et al., 2000; Tan, 2001;
Trent and Monczka, 1999). Thus, we can offer the fol-
lowing hypothesis:

H5a. Supplier quality management is positively re-
lated to product/service design.

A number of researchers have found that improved
supplier relations enhance the performance of both
suppliers and buyers, and this is especially true when
quality and delivery are buyer priorities (Flynn et al.,
1995; Ho et al., 1999; Shin et al., 2000). The produc-
tion of quality products is necessarily dependent on
the timely delivery of quality materials, so it is essen-
tial that materials supplied meet the buyer’s speciﬁ-
cations and standards for quality (Flynn et al., 1995;
Forza and Flippini, 1998; Grieco and Gozzo, 1985;
Trent and Monczka, 1999). Improving the quality of
purchased materials and parts, a main source of pro-
cess variability, will have a positive effect on process
management (Flynn et al., 1995) by eliminating vari-
ance in materials and parts, which makes it possible
to utilize internal controls over such other variables
as machinery and the workforce (Forza and Flippini,
1998). Thus, we are led to the following hypothesis:

that successful customer/supplier cooperation can
result in inventory reduction beneﬁts for both parties.

H5c. Supplier quality management is positively re-
lated to inventory management performance.

2.1.6. Product/service design

Under TQM systems, product/service design efforts
have two objectives: designing manufacturable prod-
ucts and designing quality into the products (Flynn
et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1999). Designing to sim-
plify manufacturing utilizes cross-functional teams to
reduce the number of parts per product and standard-
ize the parts (Chase et al., 2001), which results in more
efﬁcient process management by reducing process
complexity and process variance (Ahire and Dreyfus,
2000; Flynn et al., 1995). The same cross-functional
team that designed the product can also focus on im-
proving manufacturing processes (Ahire and Dreyfus,
2000). Thus, we offer the following hypothesis:

H6a. Product design is positively related to process
management.

Using as few parts as possible and standardizing as
many of these parts per product as is feasible speeds
up the learning curve effect on employees, thereby en-
hancing quality and reducing costs due to decreased
variety and increased volume (Tan, 2001). As the num-
ber of components decreases, the failure rate of a prod-
uct also decreases and its reliability increases (Ahire
and Dreyfus, 2000; Flynn et al., 1995). Quality prob-
lems can be further reduced by including customers’
requirements in new product/service design reviews
prior to production (Forza and Flippini, 1998). Thus,
the following hypothesis is proposed:

H5b. Supplier quality management is positively re-
lated to process management.

H6b. Product design is positively related to quality
performance.

A direct contribution effective supplier manage-
ment makes to ﬁrm performance is inventory reduc-
tion (Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Engelkemeyer, 1990;
Levandoski, 1993; United States General Accounting
Ofﬁce, 1991), which enables ﬁrms to sustain efforts
to reduce waste, eliminate safety stocks, and create a
leaner operation (Choi, 1995; Krajewski and Ritzman,
2001). A study by Chapman and Carter (1990) shows

2.1.7. Process management

Process management entails taking a preventive
approach to quality improvement such as designing
processes that are fool-proof and that provide stable
production schedules and work distribution (Flynn
et al., 1995; Saraph et al., 1989) to reduce process
variation (Flynn et al., 1995) by building quality into
the product during the production stage (Handﬁeld


418

H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435

et al., 1999). Reducing process variation should re-
sult in increased output uniformity as well as reduced
rework and waste (Anderson et al., 1994; Forza and
Flippini, 1998) because quality problems are identi-
ﬁed and corrected immediately (Ahire and Dreyfus,
2000). Regular preventive equipment maintenance
positively contributes to product quality by improv-
ing machine reliability and reducing interruptions
in production (Ho et al., 1999). Flynn et al. (1995)
found that effective process management results in
an increased percent-passed ﬁnal inspection with no
rework. This increased production quality leads to
improved product quality and, in turn, other improve-
ments in competitive priorities such as reduced costs
and fast delivery. Additionally, the empirical ﬁndings
by Ahire and Dreyfus (2000) and Forza and Flippini
(1998) show that process management directly and
positively affects product quality. Thus, the following
hypothesis is offered:

H7. Process management
quality performance.

is positively related to

2.1.8. Firm performance

Companies implementing TQM experience high
inventory turnover, a situation which enables the
identiﬁcation of scheduling and production problems
(Krajewski and Ritzman, 2001; Tan, 2001) and en-
courages continuous improvement of processes and
product quality (Adam et al., 1997). These improve-
ments should result in lower scrap and rework costs
as well as enhanced productivity and lead-time per-
formance. Thus, we can expect that better inventory
management will lead to increased quality perfor-
mance.

H8a. Inventory management performance is posi-
tively related to quality performance.

Quality performance improves ﬁnancial and market
performance, and the literature offers several expla-
nations for these effects. First, as a ﬁrm acquires a
reputation for delivering high quality products and
services, the elasticity of demand can decrease, which,
in turn, can enable the ﬁrm to charge higher prices and
earn higher proﬁts (Shetty, 1988). Second, improving
product quality by reducing waste and improving ef-
ﬁciency will increase the return on assets (Handﬁeld

et al., 1998), which will increase proﬁtability. Third,
reduced rework, less scrap, and improved productivity
will lower the cost structure of a ﬁrm, which enables
the ﬁrm to offer lower prices—if it is motivated to
do so—for products and services without denting the
proﬁt margin. Low prices can increase market share
and sales (Deming, 1986; Maani et al., 1994; Reed
et al., 1996). Last, improvements in quality will re-
sult in more satisﬁed customers with greater loyalty,
increased sales (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Choi and
Eboch, 1998; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Hendricks and
Singhal, 1997), and an enhanced competitive position
(Aaker and Jacobson, 1994; Fornell et al., 1996). The
beneﬁcial effect of product/service quality on mar-
ket share (Buzzell et al., 1975; Craig and Douglas,
1982; Jacobson and Aaker, 1987; Phillips et al., 1983;
Zeithaml and Fry, 1981) and proﬁt when measured
as return on investment (Craig and Douglas, 1982;
Jacobson and Aaker, 1987; MacMillan et al., 1982;
Phillips et al., 1983; Zeithaml and Fry, 1981) is a
consistent ﬁnding of research published in market-
ing literature. Based on the reviewed literature, the
following hypothesis is suggested:

H8b. Quality performance is positively related to
ﬁnancial and market performance.

3. Research methodology

The data for this research were drawn from a
cross-sectional mail study conducted to investigate
TQM, just-in-time purchasing (JITP) and the perfor-
mance of ﬁrms operating in the 48 contiguous states
of the US that have implemented TQM and JITP tech-
niques. Using data collected through cross-sectional
mail survey methodology is appropriate because the
research questions posed in this study lend themselves
to investigating the relationships between multiple
variables. A large sample size is required to obtain
reliable and valid research results. Moreover, it is
relatively inexpensive and has the greatest potential
for reaching a large number of respondents widely
dispersed (Alreck and Settle, 1985). Issues pertaining
to the construction of the instrument and measures,
the survey procedure, the sample, and the tests for
reliability and exploratory factor analysis are brieﬂy
reviewed in the following sections. The discussion of


H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435

419

tests for reliability and validity also includes the re-
sults of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis performed in
the current study in order to reﬁne the resulting scales
in exploratory factor analysis and to establish unidi-
mensionality, convergent validity, and discriminant
validity of the measures used in this study.

3.1. Construction of the instrument and measures

Churchill’s (1979) work provided the basis for the
construction of the instrument and measures utilized in
this study. The domains of constructs were identiﬁed
via a thorough review of the literature. For most of the
items of the TQM construct, Saraph et al.’s (1989) sur-
vey instrument was useful. Saraph et al. (1989) mea-
sured the factors of supplier cooperation and materials
quality as one factor: supplier quality management.
The measurement of these factors in this study, how-
ever, required a more in-depth examination. Therefore,
to measure supplier cooperation and materials quality,
the items pertaining to these two factors from Saraph
et al.’s questionnaire were grouped based on content
analysis. In addition, one item was adapted from Ettlie
and Reza (1992) and the others were originated in the
literature review. The list of scales, items, and their
sources are presented in Appendix A.

Saraph et al.’s (1989) instrument uses a discrete,
Likert-type scale. This study favored the use of a
continuous scale because, as research shows, as the
number of scaling points decreases, the amount of
information lost increases (Martin, 1978; McClelland
and Judd, 1993; Russell and Bobko, 1992). There-
fore, a continuous scale 100 mm long was utilized.
The polar points pertaining to TQM practices were
none = 0 and very high = 100. The use of continu-
ous scales for research (e.g. Taylor et al., 1992) has
become acceptable in the social sciences. The word-
ing of some borrowed items was changed to adapt
them to a continuous scale format.

The items relating to performance variables were
based on a review of the literature on strategic man-
agement, marketing, and operations management (see
Appendix A). Three levels of performance measures
were identiﬁed: ﬁnancial, market, and operating.
These performance measures are consistent with the
performance measurement in the studies presented in
Table 2. The values of the end poles measuring relative
perceived performance are adapted from Venkatraman

and Ramanujam (1987). We asked respondents to
rate performance measures of their ﬁrms from “worse
than competition” to “better than competition” on a
continuous scale (worse than competition = 0, better
than competition = 100) for the last ﬁscal year. The
relative perceived performance is measured for 1 year
because it is the common period for ﬁrms which have
been using TQM practices.

This study was pilot tested at a joint dinner meeting
of the American Production and Inventory Control
Society (APICS) and the Institute for Supply Man-
agement (ISM, formerly the National Association of
Purchasing Management). We tested the study there
because the test sample was similar to our actual sam-
ple. Statistical analyses were performed on the data
obtained from 11 respondents, but our statistical tests
were restricted to Cronbach’s alpha (α) and a few cor-
relations because the sample was small. The values
of Cronbach’s α obtained for each factor were sat-
isfactory, exceeding, as they did, the threshold value
of 0.70 suggested by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994).
Additional interviews with the ISM board members
who participated in the pilot study showed that the
questionnaire needed only a few minor changes in
wording to clarify two questions that were to be used
in the actual study.

3.2. Target population and survey procedure

The pilot study and power analysis determined a
target sample of 1884 business units. The industries
most likely to implement TQM and JITP were iden-
tiﬁed through a literature review. The SIC codes of
the industries from which target respondents would
be selected were submitted to the American Society
for Quality (ASQ) and the ISM, which supplied ad-
dresses for chosen respondents. In addition to indus-
try speciﬁcations, other criteria were relevant to the
selection of target respondents. We preferred that re-
spondents hold a high rank in their companies. An-
other concerned ﬁnding respondents who were likely
to be familiar with the implementation of TQM and
JITP in their companies and knowledgeable about their
ﬁrm’s performance. Job titles provided by ASQ and
ISM such as quality manager, continuous improve-
ment manager, and supplier and quality manager indi-
cated that those organizations had implemented TQM
techniques in some form.

Following the Total Design Methodology sug-
gested by Dillman (1978), we mailed questionnaires;
cover letters; and postage-paid, self-addressed re-
turn envelopes to the 1884 subjects. We followed his
four-step procedure, although our response rate was
sufﬁciently high after the second and third steps that
the fourth step was not pursued. We received 383
replies. One was unusable, so we had 382 usable
surveys, a 20.3% response rate, which is in line with
that of other studies (e.g. Choi and Eboch, 1998; Das
et al., 2000; Madu et al., 1995).

By testing the difference of the interest variables
between early and late respondents, an estimate of
non-response bias was calculated (Armstrong and
Overton, 1977). To test the non-response bias, two
sample t-test procedures were conducted for TQM,
JITP, and three perceived performance factors. None
of the t-test results indicated a signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the two response waves on the means
of these variables. The second test of non-response
bias concerned the ﬁrms’ demographics: number
of employees, annual sales and ownership of the
organization. χ2tests were run to ﬁnd out whether
there was a signiﬁcant difference in the three demo-
graphic variables between early and late respondents.
Results indicated that no signiﬁcant differences on
demographics existed between the two waves of re-
sponses. Fifty-nine respondents either returned the
blank questionnaire in the provided envelope or con-
tacted the researcher by phone to explain why they
chose not
to participate in the study. The results
of statistical tests and qualitative data indicate that
non-respondents did not differ signiﬁcantly from
respondents.

3.3. Sample demographics

Missing values were neither calculated nor substi-
tuted for the performance measures, so the ﬁnal sam-
ple used to test the research model was reduced to
214. Replies came from 42 states, although the tar-
get sample included ﬁrms from all 48 states. No ﬁrms
in Delaware, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada
and Wyoming answered the questionnaire. Moreover,
the ﬁnal sample also lacked responses from Missis-
sippi, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia. Thus, the
non-responses were not clustered geographically. The
38 states that comprised the sample did, however,

provide a fair, representative coverage of geographical
differences in the US.

The majority of respondents ﬁlled positions with
titles such as president, vice president, director, man-
ager, and coordinator. Additionally, the respondents’
functions were concerned with quality practices, gen-
eral management, engineering, and purchasing, thus,
they were likely to pay careful attention to perfor-
mance measures (Germain and Dröge, 1997). We
concluded that
the survey’s respondents did pos-
sess the knowledge required to answer the questions
appropriately.

Although the organizations that make up the sam-
ple represent various manufacturing industries (SIC
codes 20–39) and service industries (e.g. transporta-
tion, wholesale, ﬁnancial, and health care), the sam-
ple is skewed toward manufacturing ﬁrms. Fifteen
percent of the sample is comprised of service ﬁrms.
The most well-represented industries in the manufac-
turing sector are rubber and miscellaneous products
(8.5%); fabricated metal (8.9%); machinery and com-
puter (7.9%); electrical and electronic (11.2%); and
measuring, analyzing and controlling instruments
(9.8%). Our cross-industry sample is appropriate, as
Pannirselvam and Ferguson (2001) suggest, because
distinctions between manufacturing and service have
become blurred as manufacturers have become more
responsive to customers and service organizations
more concerned about quality process and output.

Approximately 30.4% of the ﬁrms had 100 or fewer
employees, 23.4% of the ﬁrms employed between 101
and 250 workers, 12.6% of the ﬁrms had 251–500 on
the payroll, and 33.6% of the ﬁrms had more than 500
employees. About 28.5% of the ﬁrms reported annual
sales of US$ 12.5 million or less, and 25% of the ﬁrms
had annual sales between US$ 12.5 million and 50 mil-
lion. The ﬁrms that had annual sales between US$ 51
million and 100 million comprised about 8% of the ﬁ-
nal sample. Companies with annual sales between US$
101 million and 500 million accounted for 25.2% of
the ﬁnal sample, and approximately another 8% of the
ﬁrms had annual sales of more than US$ 500 million.

3.4. Tests for reliability and validity

This section reports the results of tests for relia-
bility and three components of construct validity—
unidimensionality, convergent validity and discrimi-

nant validity. First, reliability of each scale of TQM
and performance constructs was estimated by calculat-
ing Cronbach’s α (Cronbach, 1951). Several items in
the TQM factors that did not contribute to the α values
of the scales were dropped (see Appendix A). None
of the items in the performance construct was elimi-
nated. All TQM and perceived performance scales had
acceptable reliability levels, values of α equal to 0.70
or higher (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994).

To establish the unidimensionality of factors, an
exploratory factor analysis using principal component
extraction with a varimax rotation was separately
performed for TQM and perceived performance con-
structs. Because a signiﬁcant number of the organiza-
tions did not have quality departments, the questions
relating to a quality department were eliminated
from the exploratory factor analysis of TQM. The
examination of eigenvalues and screen test results re-
vealed eight factors of TQM. What were proposed as
separate scales—supplier cooperation and materials
quality—actually formed a single factor; hence, the
name of the factor “supplier quality management” in
the study by Saraph et al. (1989) is retained. Process
management emerged as two factors, showing the
same pattern Saraph et al. (1989) found in their study.
This study conﬁrms the existence of two separate
scales, which I have called “inspection” and “process
management.” The other items formed the expected
factors. As a result of examining the loadings and
communalities, several items were also dropped in
this step (see Appendix A). The inspection scale was
not included in the additional data analyses discussed
in the following sections because it was deemed to
add little value to the content of quality management.
In the case of the perceived performance construct,
three factors emerged. They were not, however, the
same as the proposed scales: ﬁnancial and market
performance, quality performance, and inventory
management performance. The indicators of these
performance factors are listed in Appendix A and
described in Section 2. (For more details about the
research method and the tests for reliability and factor
analyses, see Kaynak, 1997.) Cronbach’s α for each
ﬁnal scale pertaining to TQM and performance was
recalculated, and the reliability values for each factor
exceeded the threshold value.

Prior to evaluating the structural equation model
(SEM), the validity of the measurement models was

tested (Byrne, 1998; Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993a). In
other words, the resulting scales in exploratory fac-
tor analysis were evaluated and reﬁned by a conﬁr-
matory factor analysis (CFA) before testing the full
latent variable model (Gerbing and Anderson, 1988).
The measurement model for each factor was estimated
separately, then, after combining the factors into pairs,
each pair was estimated separately. After estimating
the measurement model for all factors without con-
straining the covariance matrix of the factors, the SEM
for the factors together with the measurement mod-
els was estimated. At each step, whether or not the
model ﬁts the data was assessed. This assessment of
the model was done by examining the standard errors,
t-values, standardized residuals, modiﬁcation indices,
and a number of goodness-of-ﬁt statistics (Jöreskog
and Sörbom, 1993a).

LISREL 8.14 software (Jöreskog and Sörbom,
1993b) was employed to test the measurement models
and the research model. The ﬁt indices used in this
study to estimate measurement models are the ratio
of χ2 to degree of freedom, Root Mean Square Error
of Approximation (RMSEA), a consistent version of
the Akaike’s Information Criterion (CAIC), the Parsi-
mony Goodness-of-Fit Index (PGFI), the Parsimony
Normed Fit Index (PNFI), and the Comparative Fit
Index (CFI). These ﬁt indices, with the exception of
RMSEA, were chosen because of their abilities to
adjust for model complexity and degrees of freedom.
Although RMSEA is sensitive to model complexity, it
is one of the most informative criteria as to an abso-
lute ﬁt (see Byrne, 1998 for details). Recommended
values of these ﬁt indices for satisfactory ﬁt of a
model to data are presented in Table 3.

The assumptions of multivariate analysis—norma-
lity, linearity, and homoscedasticity—were tested for
the variables used in the measurement models. Anal-
yses for the assumptions of the multivariate model
indicated no statistically signiﬁcant violations.

During the estimation of the measurement mod-
els for TQM and perceived performance constructs,
an examination of the modiﬁcation indices and stan-
dardized residuals revealed redundant items in some
scales. These redundant items were eliminated, which
resulted in better-ﬁtted models (Byrne, 1998). A com-
parison of goodness-of-ﬁt statistics relating to each
measurement model to the recommended values of
these ﬁt indices (see Table 3) reveals satisfactory ﬁt of

the measurement models to the data. The remaining
items in each scale are indicated in Appendix A as well
as their standardized factor loadings on the respec-
tive factors. (See the ﬁrst value in parenthesis next to
remaining each item.) The mean values, standard de-
viations, bivariate correlations, and Cronbach’s α for
reﬁned scales are presented in Table 4. The resulting
values of Cronbach’s α and factor loadings establish
the reliability and unidimensionality of the measures
used in this study.

The extent to which multiple attempts to measure
the same constructs are in agreement is the issue in
convergent validity (Bagozzi et al., 1991; Hoskisson
et al., 1993). An instrument has convergent validity if
the correlations between measures of the same con-
struct using different methods are high (Crocker and
Algina, 1986). In measurement studies, each item in
the scale can be considered a different method for mea-
suring the construct (Ahire et al., 1996). A test of each
item’s coefﬁcient was used to assess convergent valid-

ity. If each item’s coefﬁcient is greater than twice its
standard error (t-value), then measures indicate high
convergent validity (cf. Krause, 1999). The t-value of
each retained item is presented in Appendix A. All
t-values are signiﬁcant, indicating high convergence
validity.

The concern with discriminant validity is the de-
gree to which measures of different factors are discrete
(Bagozzi et al., 1991; Hoskisson et al., 1993). An in-
strument has discriminant validity if the correlations
between measures of different factors using the same
method of measurement are lower than the reliability
coefﬁcients (Crocker and Algina, 1986). The bivariate
correlations between seven TQM and three perceived
performance factors are presented in Table 4. Signiﬁ-
cant correlations are expected because of the theoret-
ical relation between them and the large size of the
sample. Nevertheless, the correlation coefﬁcients were
lower than the reliability coefﬁcients, suggesting that
measures have discriminant validity.

Fig. 2 depicts the SEM results of the relationship
between TQM practices and factors of performance
measures. Each path in the ﬁgure indicates the as-
sociated hypotheses as well as the estimated path
coefﬁcients and t-values. The goodness-of-ﬁt statis-
tics used to assess the ﬁt of the data to the hypoth-
esized model are the same as those used to test the
measurement models and are presented in Table 3.

In the light of recommended values of ﬁt indices, a
review of the goodness-of-ﬁt indices pertaining to the
hypothesized model reveals a good ﬁt of the model to
the data. All of the paths in the model are supported
(t-values for path coefﬁcients greater than 1.65 are
signiﬁcant at P < 0.10; t-values greater than 1.96 are
signiﬁcant at P < 0.05; t-values greater than 2.58 are
signiﬁcant at P < 0.01).

5. Discussion

5.1. Discussion of results

The primary purposes of this study were to in-
vestigate the relationships among TQM practices and
to identify the direct and indirect effects of TQM
practices on the various dimensions of performance.
Through testing the hypothesized structural model,
which was developed based on a comprehensive liter-
ature review, these purposes were accomplished. The
signiﬁcant implications of the results of the structural
model testing for researchers and practitioners, respec-
tively, are discussed in the rest of this section.

The ﬁndings as a whole suggest that a positive rela-
tionship exists between the extent to which companies
implement TQM and ﬁrm performance. This overall
result corroborates the studies (Douglas and Judge,
2001; Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Hendricks and Singhal,
1996, 1997) in which TQM is operationalized as a
single construct. This validation is important because,
to investigate the relationship between TQM and per-
formance, Easton and Jarrell (1998) and Hendricks
and Singhal (1996, 1997) employed different research
methodologies from that utilized in this study (see
Table 2). As Palich et al. (2000) point out, it is impor-
tant to obtain consistent research results among mul-
tiple studies using a variety of research methods to

make strong statements “about the strength and gen-
erality of the ﬁndings” (p. 161).

Dow et al. (1999) argue that a fundamental weak-
ness in the quality management
literature is the
assumption, without any empirical testing, of the in-
terdependence of quality management practices. (It
should be noted that the empirical ﬁndings supporting
the interdependence of quality management practices
were published by Anderson et al., 1995 and Flynn
et al., 1995.) Thus, another signiﬁcant ﬁnding of
this study is the validation of the interdependence of
TQM practices, which supports both the results of
studies (e.g. Das et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Ho
et al., 2001) referred to earlier in this research and
the theory of TQM suggested by quality gurus (e.g.
Deming, 1993).

The ﬁndings also show that assessment of manage-
ment leadership is necessary when the effectiveness
of TQM implementation is investigated. Management
leadership is directly related to training, employee
relations, supplier quality management, and prod-
uct design, and indirectly related to quality data and
reporting, and process management. Effective lead-
ership by management also indirectly affects ﬁrm
performance through the mediating effects of the
other six practices of TQM. The results also demon-
strate the importance of two other infrastructural
practices—training and employee relations—to the
assessment of TQM implementation. Training and
employee relations are directly related to quality data
and reporting, and they are indirectly related to sup-
plier quality management, product/service design, and
process management through quality data and report-
ing. As with management leadership, they indirectly
affect ﬁrm performance.

Quality data and reporting, one of the core TQM
practices, does not have any direct effects on any of
the three performance dimensions; however, the scale
of quality data and reporting has indirect inﬂuences
on them through supplier quality management, prod-
uct/service design, and process management. The con-
ﬁrmed indirect effect of training and direct effect of
quality data and reporting on process management in
this study explain the lack of signiﬁcant relationships
found between task-related training and process man-
agement in the studies by Anderson et al. (1995), Forza
and Flippini (1998), and Rungtusanatham et al. (1998).
Thus, future studies should evaluate availability and


426

use of timely quality data when researchers investigate
the relationships between TQM practices and assess
the success of TQM implementation.

Supplier quality management emerges as an impor-
tant component of TQM, directly and positively affect-
ing product/service design, process management, and
inventory management performance. Supplier quality
management has an indirect effect on improved qual-
ity performance through product/service design and
process management. It is important that when inves-
tigating the role of supplier quality management in
the effectiveness of TQM implementation, researchers
deﬁne inventory management performance as a rele-
vant performance measure. It is also important that
they recognize the indirect positive effects of supplier
quality management on quality performance, and ﬁ-
nancial and market performance. The ﬁndings regard-
ing the effects of supplier quality management also
point to some limitations of the conclusions reached in
several studies that investigated the relation between
TQM and performance. One of the ﬁndings, among
others, by Powell (1995), for example, is that close-
ness to suppliers only marginally correlates with ﬁnan-
cial performance. He concludes that the most critical
factors of successful TQM implementation are exec-
utive commitment, open organization, and employee
empowerment, but he overlooks a possible indirect ef-
fect of closeness to suppliers on ﬁnancial performance.
In another study, Mohrman et al. (1995) found that
no signiﬁcant relation existed between TQM (TQM is
operationalized as two dimensions: core TQM prac-
tices and production-oriented practices) and inventory
turnover. As the ﬁnding of this study shows, supplier
quality management is the only TQM practice that has
a direct effect on inventory turnover. Thus, in their
study, the non-signiﬁcant ﬁnding may have been due
to the information lost by combining TQM practices.
Flynn et al. (1995) pointed out the missing link
between product design process and process ﬂow
management scales and called for its future inves-
tigation. Thus, another notable result in this study
is the signiﬁcant direct effect of product/service de-
sign on process management. Product/service design
positively contributes to quality performance directly
as well as indirectly through process management.
Process management is another core TQM practice
that is directly and positively related to quality per-
formance. This result conﬁrms the ﬁndings in studies

(Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Forza
and Flippini, 1998) that investigated the relation of
process management to quality performance.

The direct relation of inventory management per-
formance to quality performance shows that improve-
ments in quality, productivity, and on-time delivery
are partly due to reduced inventories. Both the indirect
effect of inventory management and the direct effect
of quality performance on ﬁnancial and market per-
formance validate the notion that the improvements
in operating performance result in increased sales and
market share, thereby providing a competitive edge to
companies.

In summary, then, the three TQM practices which
have direct effects on operating performance (inven-
tory management and quality performance) are sup-
plier quality management, product/service design, and
process management. Management leadership, train-
ing, employee relations, and quality data and reporting
affect operating performance through supplier qual-
ity management, product/service design, and process
management. The positive effect of TQM practices on
ﬁnancial and market performance is mediated through
operating performance. This ﬁnding is consistent with
the results in the study by Grandzol and Gershon
(1997).

it

is apparent

Given the discussion above,

that
scholars who engage in TQM research should pay
attention to several research design issues if they
wish to reach theoretically sound conclusions. First,
the multidimensionality of the TQM construct should
be recognized. Second, a broad set of performance
variables—including operating, market, and ﬁnan-
cial measures—relevant to TQM practices should be
measured. Third, researchers must be aware that the
positive effect of each TQM practice on various lev-
els of performance is different. Finally, data analyses
more sophisticated than a series of multiple regres-
sion or correlations should be performed because it is
important to be able to identify the direct and indirect
effects of TQM practices. As the results of this study
show, the relationships among TQM practices and the
effects of these practices on ﬁrm performance are too
complex to be identiﬁed by performing regression
analysis or correlations.

The conﬁrmed positive effects of TQM practices
on ﬁrm performance in this study is encouraging for
practitioners. The initiative in implementing TQM

427

may originate at different levels of an organization.
In companies that operate in highly global competi-
tive environments and in quality-focused markets, the
parent company may push divisions and/or strategic
business units to adopt TQM practices (Handﬁeld
and Ghosh, 1994). In some instances, as expressed
by some of this study’s respondents, functional man-
agers at local levels may recognize the need for TQM
implementation to respond to competitive challenges.
The empirically validated positive relation of TQM
to ﬁrms’ performance such as that documented in this
study, can be very useful for the leaders who take the
initiative in quality improvement to promote and ob-
tain the resources needed for TQM implementation.
TQM has, as this study shows, much to offer ﬁrms
that wish to improve their performance. The accounts
of speciﬁc and individual less-than-successful efforts
to implement TQM should not be disheartening, for
the problems might lie in the implementation of TQM
rather than in TQM practices themselves.

This study’s ﬁnding of the interdependent nature of
TQM practices helps explain why TQM has not pro-
duced maximum beneﬁts for every company that has
implemented it. Management leadership clearly has a
signiﬁcant role to ﬁll in a successful implementation
of TQM practices. The more aggressive top man-
agement is in the implementation of TQM, the more
training employees at all levels get. Moreover, man-
agement commitment to TQM empowers employees
and makes them more conscious of the organization’s
goals. Management leadership is also important in
forging strategic partnerships with suppliers and in
creating products that are consumer focused and man-
ufacturable. Too often, however, a serious commit-
ment on the part of top management to TQM is weak
or missing. Several respondents complained about
management’s lack of support, its resistance to change,
and the failure of the organization’s structure to change
when TQM practices were implemented. Problems
like these make it difﬁcult to cultivate and take advan-
tage of opportunities for TQM’s potential beneﬁts.

It

that

is apparent

the practitioners as well as
researchers cannot simply pick and choose a few
techniques to implement. The structural model pro-
posed and tested in this study may offer a ﬂow chart
to practitioners for effective TQM implementation.
Companies ﬁrst should secure a complete top man-
agement commitment to TQM implementation, and

this commitment should motivate management
to
provide their employees quality-related training, in-
stitute teamwork, and employee involvement to lay
the foundation for other practices of TQM.

Actually, it should do more. Establishing an effec-
tive system for collecting and disseminating quality
data throughout the organization in a timely manner
is necessary to realize improvements in supplier qual-
ity management, product/service design, and process
management. Then, ﬁrms can focus on developing co-
operative relationships with their suppliers to improve
the quality of incoming materials and to involve them
in the buyer ﬁrms’ product/service design and process
management activities. Coordination and cooperation
among employees who participate in product/service
design and process management are essential to im-
proving quality performance of ﬁrms. All in all, a ﬁrm
cannot simply select some of the TQM practices dis-
cussed above and expect to realize full beneﬁts from
implementing partial TQM.

5.2. Limitations of ﬁndings

Every effort was made at the design stage of this
study to obtain reliable and valid ﬁndings as presented
in Section 3. Nevertheless, several limitations of this
study should be discussed in this section. Because it
uses the same data for both exploratory and conﬁr-
matory factor analysis, this study has a major limi-
tation. As the literature makes clear (Anderson and
Gerbing, 1988; Kelloway, 1995), using the same data
for both analyses is frequently done, probably because
it streamlines research activities (Huber and Power,
1985). Research like that done for this study requires
substantial investments of time and money, more so
than in ﬁelds that allow researchers to collect data
from one organization by studying the responses from
a large sample comprised of respondents within it
(Huber and Power, 1985). Because a cross-sectional
survey method was utilized here, causal inferences
were derived from existing theory and research only.
This is, admittedly, a controversial approach, but Cook
and Campbell (1979) say that it is acceptable to clarify
theory and assess speciﬁc causal effects from correla-
tional research data with structural and path analyses.
As far as construct validity is concerned, the use
of self-reported data constitutes a major limitation,
primarily because common method variance (CMV)


428

H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435

is an acknowledged threat to studies that rely on
self-reports for their data. A post hoc analysis of
CMV—an evaluation of key informants, Harman’s
one-factor test, and multiple methods and sources—
was performed in an earlier study by Kaynak (1997).
The size of this study’s sample, given the time and
resource limitations that constrained it, made it im-
possible to use another method to gather data or
corroborate what respondents reported about the ex-
tent to which their ﬁrms had implemented TQM.
Likewise, the major problem when investigating per-
formance at the business-unit level is the difﬁculty
of obtaining objective performance measures. It is
widely reported in the literature that managers are
reluctant to share objective data with researchers (e.g.
Choi and Liker, 1995; Swamidass and Newell, 1987).
The same problem was also observed in this study.

Furthermore, because archival data are reported at
the corporate rather than the business-unit level and
so are unavailable for small and private businesses, it
is difﬁcult to ﬁnd secondary data on ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. It was because of these difﬁculties that Choi
and Eboch (1998) and Stanley and Wisner (2001)
opted to use perceptual data to obtain a large sample.
An attempt was made for this study to collect sec-
ondary objective data on the number of employees and
the annual sales of ﬁrms from other sources. The high
convergence between self-reported and archival data
on number of employees (r = 0.91) and annual sales
of ﬁrms (r = 0.87) indicates a high level of response
consistency. Although analyses of key informants—
Harman’s one-factor
and secondary data
sources—do not completely eliminate the possibility
of same source, self-report biases, the results indicated
non-signiﬁcant common method variance. Overall,
validity and reliability in this study seem adequate.

6. Conclusion and further research

This study contributes to the TQM literature by val-
idating the direct and indirect relations among TQM
practices and the effects of these practices on ﬁrm per-
formance. With the exception of Flynn et al. (1995),
the TQM practices investigated in this study repre-
sent a wider domain of TQM than the other studies in
which direct and indirect effects of TQM practices on
performance are identiﬁed. In addition, measurement

of performance at three levels in this research reveals
more insights than the other studies do into the relation
of TQM practices to ﬁrms’ performance. It also sheds
more light than they do on the relationships among
three levels of performance: inventory management,
quality, and ﬁnancial and market performance.

A by-product of this study is a reﬁned version of
the questionnaire constructed by Saraph et al. (1989)
that can be used to measure TQM implementation
without making excessive demands on the time of
both respondents and researchers. The ﬁnal TQM
measurement model includes 30 items, as indicated
in Appendix A. In addition, a scale on customer re-
lations can be added in future studies as one of the
techniques of TQM. Evaluating customer relations as
a technique of TQM is becoming more viable because
TQM organizations are customer focused. Measure-
ment studies on TQM discussed in this paper, as a
part of the literature review, provide measurement
items for the scale of customer focus. As pointed
out by Amundson (1998), researchers should broaden
their focus to include more complex issues regarding
TQM implementation rather than simply replicating
studies that identify TQM practices. Given that the
response rate and the length of a questionnaire are
inversely related, the shortened version of the ques-
tionnaire presented in this study allows researchers to
investigate the relation of TQM to other variables of
interest without seriously hurting response rate.

The ﬁndings of this study, as well as some of those
reported in the literature reviewed in this paper, sup-
port the positive effects of TQM practices on ﬁrms’
performance. A lack of top management commitment
to the implementation of TQM has emerged as a pos-
sible reason for the failure of TQM systems in some
organizations. Nevertheless, further empirical research
should be conducted to assess the degree of effective
organizational functioning under TQM systems to re-
ﬁne and sharpen our insights into the relationship be-
tween TQM practices and ﬁrms’ performance. Having
identiﬁed a number of gaps between TQM processes
and outcomes in their conceptual study, Hackman and
Wageman (1995) support the contention that the effec-
tiveness of TQM should be measured in order to de-
termine whether TQM changes the way people work
together to meet customer requirements.

Effectiveness criteria such as organizational learn-
ing, employee satisfaction, decentralized structure,

and resource acquisition should be assessed in the
companies implementing TQM. Although TQM is
learning-oriented, many learning failures in organiza-
tions that have implemented TQM have been reported
(Hackman and Wageman, 1995). The effectiveness
of the organizations that implement TQM depends
on their ability to satisfy their employees, a neces-
sary goal for companies that wish to realize beneﬁts
from employee involvement. Furthermore, employee
participation in monitoring, detecting, and correct-
ing quality problems requires decentralization and
delegation in organizations implementing TQM. De-
centralization, suggest Germain and Spears (1999),
not only increases the number of minds searching for
imaginative solutions to a ﬁrm’s quality management
problems, it also increases the number of internal
groups that will support creative solutions once they
are found. Finally,
the effectiveness of TQM or-
ganizations should be measured by their degree of
integration with their supplier bases because supplier
quality management is a critical component of TQM.

Appendix A. Measurement scales, items and their
sources

The items marked with the symbol (†) were retained
after testing the measurement models. The ﬁrst value
in parenthesis for each retained item indicates the stan-
dardized factor loadings. The second value represents
the t-value resulting from testing each item’s coefﬁ-
cient. (The ﬁrst item in each scale does not have an
associated t-value because it has a ﬁxed parameter in
LISREL.) In her earlier study, Kaynak (1997) dropped
these items (marked with symbol ‡) as a result of
reliability tests and exploratory factor analysis. The

ones marked with asterisk (*) belong to the scale of
inspection.
