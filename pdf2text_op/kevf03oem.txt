Aims: To examine the association between components of organisational justice (that is, justice of
decision making procedures and interpersonal treatment) and health of employees.
Methods: The Poisson regression analyses of recorded all-cause sickness absences with medical cer-
tificate and the logistic regression analyses of minor psychiatric morbidity, as assessed by the General
Health Questionnaire, and poor self rated health status were based on a cohort of 416 male and 3357
female employees working during 1998–2000 in 10 hospitals in Finland.
Results: Low versus high justice of decision making procedures was associated with a 41% higher risk
of sickness absence in men (rate ratio (RR) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.8), and a 12%
higher risk in women (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2) after adjustment for baseline characteristics. The cor-
responding odds ratios (OR) for minor psychiatric morbidity were 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.6) in men and
1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7) in women, and for self rated health 1.4 in both sexes. In interpersonal treat-
ment, low justice increased the risk of sickness absence (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.6) and RR 1.2 (95%
CI 1.2 to 1.3) in men and women respectively), and minor psychiatric morbidity (OR 1.2 in both
sexes). These figures largely persisted after control for other risk factors (for example, job control, work-
load, social support, and hostility) and they were replicated in initially healthy subcohorts. No evidence
was found to support the hypothesis that organisational justice would represent a consequence of
health (reversed causality).
Conclusions: This is the first longitudinal study to show that the extent to which people are treated with
justice in workplaces independently predicts their health.

The importance of work for health goes beyond traditional

diseases caused by physical and chemical hazards.
Research suggests that psychosocial characteristics of the
work environment such as job control, work load, and social
support affect health of employees.1–5 However, other psycho-
social work characteristics may also play a role in employee
health.

The pursuit of justice is assumed to be a fundamental aspect
of any social organisation, including workplaces.6 The term
“organisational justice” refers to the extent to which employ-
ees are treated with justice at their workplace.7 Organisational
justice involves a procedural component and a relational com-
ponent. The former indicates whether decision making proce-
dures include input from affected parties, are consistently
applied, suppress bias, are accurate, are correctable, and are
ethical. The latter element refers to the polite and considerate
treatment of individuals by supervisors. Although the associa-
tions of organisational justice with work motivation, job satis-
faction, and work commitment have been shown,7 little is
known about the potential impact of organisational justice on
employee health.

Previous research suggests that low organisational justice
and unfair treatment are related to factors that inﬂuence sus-
ceptibility to illness, such as raised unfavourable serum lipids
and negative feelings.8 9 Our own recent work using cross sec-
tional data from a study of Finnish hospital personnel has
shown low procedural justice to be associated with increased
risk of sickness absence, minor psychiatric morbidity, and poor
self rated health in men and women.10 Relational justice was
also associated with these outcomes with the exception that in
men the association with self
rated health was non-
signiﬁcant.

A limitation in the existing evidence is its reliance on cross
sectional data. Such data cannot rule out the alternative
possibility that health problems may increase the likelihood of

being treated unfairly, or feelings of unjustice, or both. In these
cases, organisational justice would represent a consequence of
health rather than a predictor of health (reverse causality
hypothesis). Confounding factors may also underlie the
association: one may suspect that organisational justice is only
a marker for other psychosocial factors that inﬂuence health
(for example, job control, workload, social support, and hostil-
ity) and uncertainty remains whether organisational justice
predicts health independently of behavioural and biological
risk factors.

In the present study we expand our previous work among
Finnish hospital personnel,10 using longitudinal data and an
increased sample size to investigate the association between
organisational justice and the health of employees. The longi-
tudinal nature of the present study allows us to address the
issue of reverse causality. Data on psychosocial characteristics
of the work environment, and behavioural, and biological
markers allow us to explore whether organisational justice
independently predicts health.

METHODS
Study sample
This study is a part of an ongoing project “Work and health in
Finnish hospital personnel” coordinated by the Finnish Insti-
tute of Occupational Health. In a survey carried out between
January and April 1998, all 7375 employees (1156 men, 6219
women) in the service of the 10 hospitals in two of the 23
health care districts in Finland were asked to respond to a
questionnaire on organisational
justice, minor psychiatric
morbidity, health status, and other variables. Of the sample,

10% were doctors (434 men and 312 women), 46% nurses (233
men and 3155 women), 14% x ray and laboratory staff (56
men and 963 women), 12% administrative staff (97 men and
766 women), and 18% maintenance, cleaning, and other staff
(336 men and 1023 women). Data on sickness absence were
obtained from employers’ registers for 1997 to 1999, and a fol-
low up survey was conducted early in 2000.

These scales have successfully predicted health in prior
prospective cohort studies.2 17–20

Ethical approval
Ethical approval for the project “Work and health in Finnish
hospital personnel” was obtained from the ethics committee
of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.

Measurements
Procedural justice
The scale10 11 (range 1–5, Cronbach’s a = 0.80) was based on
the degree to which the respondent agreed with the following
statements concerning the procedures used at the workplace:
(1) Procedures are designed to hear the concerns of all those

affected by the decision.

(2) Procedures are designed to collect accurate information

necessary for making decisions.

(3) Procedures are designed to provide opportunities to

appeal or challenge the decision.

(4) Procedures are designed to generate standards so that

decisions can be made with consistency.

Relational justice
The scale10 11 (range 1–5, a = 0.90) was based on the following
statements about the general behaviour of the respondent’s
supervisor:
(1) Your supervisor considers your viewpoint.
(2) Your supervisor is able to suppress personal biases.
(3) Your supervisor treats you with kindness and considera-

tion.

(4) Your supervisor takes steps to deal with you in a truthful

manner.

In both organisational justice scales, responses were given
along a ﬁve point scale from 5 = strongly agree to 1 = strongly
disagree.

Health indicators
The outcome variables were: recorded medically certiﬁed sick-
ness absence, minor psychiatric morbidity, and self rated
health status. The number of medically certiﬁed sickness
absence spells over seven days between 1 January and 31
December 1997 represented baseline absence rate, and that
between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1999 the outcome.
Employers’ registers documented each period of sick leave for
every employee, giving the beginning and end dates of each
spell. Maternity leave and absence as a result of caring for a
sick child were not included in sickness absences. Minor psy-
chiatric morbidity was assessed using the 12 item version of
the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Individuals
scoring 4 or more are estimated to have minor psychiatric
morbidity according to studies validating GHQ-12 against
standardised psychiatric interviews,12 and this threshold was
applied in the present study. Poor health status was indicated
by health ratings less than good on a ﬁve point scale.

Other measurements
Covariates were measured in standard ways: age, sex, income,
smoking status (current smoker versus not), alcohol con-
sumption (high consumption >280 g and >190 g of absolute
alcohol per average week for men and women, respectively),13
sedentary lifestyle (less than half an hour of fast walking per
week),14 and obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2). Scales assessing
psychosocial factors were decision authority (three items,
range 1–5, a = 0.81) and skill discretion (six items, range 1–5,
a = 0.81),15 as dimensions of job control, workload (ﬁve items,
range 1–5, a = 0.83),10 social support (six items, range 0–30,
a = 0.82),16 and hostility (three items, range 1–7, a = 0.62).17

Statistical analysis
We used the SAS program package for all analyses. Mean lev-
els of dimensions of organisational justice at baseline and at
follow up were calculated, and differences between sexes, age
and income groups, those who were initially healthy and those
who had health problems at baseline, were tested by repeated
measures analysis of variance. In this analysis, age and income
were divided into high and low using median split separately
for men and women. To test the reverse causality hypothesis,
the difference in changes of organisational justice between the
initially healthy and those with health problems at baseline
was tested. A signiﬁcant interaction term between time and
baseline health would support the reverse causality hypoth-
esis if the change in justice proved to be more adverse among
those with health problems.

We checked records of sickness absence and job contracts
for inconsistencies and combined any overlapping or consecu-
tive periods of sickness absence. The number of periods of sick
leave and the follow up period in person years were calculated
for each employee. Because the number of sick leaves is in the
form of frequency data, Poisson regression models were
ﬁtted.19 21 Use of the Poisson model implies that the between
employee variance in the rates of sick leave is equal to the
expected rate of sick leave. In this study, the dispersion in rates
of sick leave did not signiﬁcantly differ from that predicted
from the Poisson model. We identiﬁed cases of minor psychi-
atric morbidity and poor self rated health status and used
logistic regression models in relation to these data.

We used regression models to estimate the strength of the
relations between organisational
justice and indicators of
health among men and women. Components of organisa-
tional justice were standardised and treated as continuous
variables. The rate ratios for sick leaves and odds ratios for
minor psychiatric morbidity and poor self rated health status
for components of organisational justice at high and low lev-
els were calculated. The cut off points for high and low organi-
sational justice were set at +1 standard deviation (SD) and - 1
SD, respectively. We adjusted rate ratios and odds ratios and
their 95% conﬁdence intervals for demographics (age and
income) and health indicators at baseline. Interactions with
sex, income, and age were tested using a cross product term.
Analyses were conducted for all participants and for the
initially healthy subcohort—that is, those with no sickness
absence in the baseline, GHQ-12 score below 4, and self rated
health either good or very good.

The role of other factors in the association between organi-
sational justice and health was studied. We examined the
degree to which organisational
justice components were
related to behavioural and biological factors (smoking, alcohol
consumption, sedentary lifestyle, and obesity) by logistic
regression analysis and the degree they were related to other
psychosocial factors (that is, components of job control, work
load, social support, and hostility) by calculating a Pearson
product moment correlation matrix for these variables.

In regression models explaining health outcomes, the
effects of organisational justice and other psychosocial factors
were adjusted for behavioural and biological variables in addi-
tion to demographics and baseline health. All psychosocial
factors were treated as continuous variables and standardised,
with cut off points for high and low levels set to +1 SD and - 1
SD, respectively. Biological and behavioural variables were
dichotomous.

Finally, we examined the independent contributions of
organisational
justice components and other psychosocial
predictors in fully adjusted models in which the effect of each
variable was adjusted for demographics, baseline health,
behavioural and biological variables, and those psychosocial
factors that separately predicted each health outcome.

RESULTS
Response rates and attrition
Altogether 5668 (77%) employees (679 men, 4989 women)
responded to the baseline questionnaire. Respondents did not

differ from the eligible population in terms of age (43.4 v 43.7
income (131 183 v 134 836 FIM), but
years) and annual
female employees were slightly over represented (88% v 84%).
The proportion of physicians was 3% and the proportion of
nurses 4% higher in respondents than in the eligible employ-
ees. Differences in proportions of other occupational groups
between respondents and eligible population were less than
1% (table 1).

Of the respondents to the baseline questionnaire, 974 had
lost or left their jobs with the hospitals before the follow-up
survey. These participants had a higher rate of sickness

absence (71.1 v 42.7 spells per 100 person-years, p < 0.001)
and prevalence of minor psychiatric morbidity (25% v 21%,
p = 0.012) at baseline than those who kept their jobs. Those
lost to follow-up were also younger (40.5 v 44.3 years,
income (135 276 v
p < 0.001) and had a higher annual
130 333 FIM, p < 0.001) but did not differ in terms of sex,
procedural and relational justice, and self-rated health status.
Of the 554 men and 4140 women who remained in the
service of the hospitals, 3773 (416 men and 3357 women)
responded to the follow-up survey, a response rate of 80%.
Respondents did not differ from the eligible population in
terms of age (46.4 v 46.3 years), annual income (130 487 v
130 334 FIM) and sex (88% v 88% female). Nurses were
slightly over-represented, but proportions of other occupa-
tional groups did not differ between respondents and the eli-
gible population (<1% tolerance, see table 1).

Levels of organisational justice
There was a declining trend in procedural and relational
justice between the baseline and follow up surveys
(p < 0.001) but no difference was found in these components
between men and women. Although levels of organisational
justice were lower in those with health problems at baseline,
no support was found for the reverse causality hypothesis
(table 2).

Effect of organisational justice on health
Table 3 presents results on the associations between proce-
dural and relational justice, and health by sex. The rate ratios
and odds ratios slightly vary between men and women, but
analyses reveal that there were no statistically signiﬁcant
interactions between organisational justice components and
sex or age on the health outcomes studied.

Procedural justice was linked with all the health outcomes.
After adjustment for sex, age, income, and baseline health, low
procedural justice, compared to high procedural justice, was
associated with a 1.15 times (95% conﬁdence intervals, CI,
1.08 to 1.23) higher risk of sickness absence in the total sam-
ple combining men and women. A signiﬁcant difference was
found between income groups (p = 0.050). The ratio in
sickness absence rates between employees experiencing low
versus high procedural justice was 1.25 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.38)
in high income employees and 1.07 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.17) in
low income employees. In the total sample, corresponding
odds ratios (OR) for minor psychiatric morbidity and poor self
rated health were 1.44 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.70) and 1.37 (95% CI
1.13 to 1.66), respectively, and there were no interactions with
income.

Low relational justice was associated with an increased risk
of sickness absence (rate ratio (RR) = 1.23, 95% CI 1.15 to
1.31) and minor psychiatric morbidity (OR = 1.19, 95% CI
1.02 to 1.40), but the association with self rated health status
was non-signiﬁcant (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.31). No
interactions between relational
justice and income were
found.

In relation to adjusted regression models, all signiﬁcant
associations between organisational justice and health among
women were replicated in the initially healthy subcohort.
Among initially healthy men, adjusted rate ratios and odds
ratios for relational justice corresponded to those observed in
all men. However, the associations of procedural justice with
sickness absence and self rated health status were weaker, and
those with minor psychiatric morbidity stronger than the cor-
responding associations in all men (table 3).

Associations with other predictors of health
Low procedural justice was associated with increased preva-
lence of smoking in women (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.40) and
heavy alcohol consumption in men (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.12 to
2.20). Low relational justice was associated with obesity in

women (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.57). All other associa-
tions between organisational justice and behavioural and bio-
logical factors were non-signiﬁcant.

The correlation matrix of table 4 shows relations between
organisational justice and other psychosocial factors. Low
procedural justice was associated with low relational justice,
low decision authority, high workload, low social support
(only in men), and high hostility. Relational justice was corre-
lated with all psychosocial factors studied. Directions of these
associations were similar to those found for procedural justice.
Low relational justice was associated with low skill discretion.
Table 5 summarises in two sets of models how adjustment
for other health risk factors affected the association between
organisational justice and health. Model 1 shows that adjust-
ment for behavioural and biological factors did not alter this
association (cf. table 3). Model 2, the fully adjusted model,
indicates that all associations between procedural justice and
indicators of health remained signiﬁcant after additional
adjustment
factors. In the fully
adjusted model, procedural justice was a stronger predictor of
sickness absence among high income employees (RR = 1.17,
95% CI 1.05 to 1.31) than among low income employees
(RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.05), replicating the interaction
found in previous models with fewer adjustments (cf. table 3).
The p value for the interaction between procedural justice and
income was 0.013.

for other psychosocial

In the fully-adjusted models, relational justice predicted
sickness absence but not minor psychiatric morbidity (table
5). No interactions between relational justice, sex, age, and
income were found.

The fully adjusted models allow evaluation of independent
contributions of components of organisational justice and
other psychosocial risk factors. Procedural justice was the
strongest predictor of poor self rated health status, and the
second strongest predictor of minor psychiatric morbidity; its
effect on medically certiﬁed sickness absence was equal to
those related to components of job control.

DISCUSSION
This is apparently the ﬁrst longitudinal study to show that the
extent to which employees are treated with justice predicts
their health. The association between low organisational
justice and increasing health problems was observable across
all the health outcomes studied, among men and women rep-
resenting not only medical professions, but also administra-
tive and maintenance jobs, and in the initially healthy subco-
horts. Although not very large, the size of the effect was
comparable to those related to established psychosocial deter-
minants of morbidity such as job control, overload, and hostil-
ity. No evidence was found to support the reverse causality
hypothesis or that the association between organisational jus-
tice and health is attributable to relations between other psy-
chosocial factors, behavioural and biological variables, and
health.

The health outcomes studied—sickness absence, GHQ
caseness, indicating minor psychiatric morbidity, and self
rated health status—are not clinically insigniﬁcant measures.
Sickness absence is a good indicator of health in the working
population when health is understood as a combination of
social, psychological, and physical functioning.22 In this study,
all spells of absence had been certiﬁed by a doctor. Infections,
musculoskeletal disorders, and injuries have been found to
account for the majority of such absences.21 The General
Health Questionnaire is a well established screening instru-
ment for minor psychiatric disorders in general population
samples,12 and more than 20 published studies have consist-
ently shown that global self rated health is an independent
predictor of mortality, despite the inclusion of numerous
speciﬁc health status indicators and other relevant covariates
known to predict mortality.23

Low procedural and relational justice equally increased the
likelihood of medically certiﬁed sickness absence, but for pro-
cedural justice there was an interaction with socioeconomic
status. Differences in health effects between income groups
suggest that procedural justice may have more salient mean-
ings for members of highly ranked occupations close to man-
agement than for employees in lower ranking occupations.
Minor psychiatric morbidity and self rated health status were
more strongly predicted by the procedural than the relational
component of justice. This is in line with earlier cross sectional
ﬁndings,10 and suggests that a low justice work environment
characterised by unjust organisational policies, practices, and
procedures is a greater risk to health than unfair treatment
from an immediate supervisor.

the contribution of procedural

Although the possibility of confounding by an unknown
factor can never be excluded, a major bias in our study is
unlikely. Firstly, both components of organisational justice
were only moderately related to other psychosocial factors.
Secondly,
justice largely
persisted after control for 14 other psychosocial, behavioural,
and biological factors. This analysis is extremely conservative.
An observed effect after such adjustments is probably an
underestimation of the true effect because risk factors tend to
concentrate among the same people and they may represent
different stages of the same pathogenic process. Job control,
workload, and social support, the main elements in the well
established job strain model, refer to an individual’s job char-
acteristics or situations in which one may need help.20 It is
possible that organisational
justice captures more basic
elements of social structure in which this and other psychoso-
cial models may be operating.

The response rates of our surveys were high but attrition
was greater among those employees who had health
problems, as indicated by sickness absence rate. Such selection
may have caused a healthy worker effect and thus attenuated
the association between organisational justice and health.
Nurses were the largest occupational group, and they were
also slightly over represented in the study sample. Thus, the

Main messages

• Research on health effects of psychosocial work character-
istics has traditionally focused on job control, job demands,
and social support.

• Broadening the view to managerial procedures and
treatment of individuals in organisations seems now to be
important.

• Low organisational justice is an independent risk factor to

the health of employees.

• The size of the effect is comparable to those observed for
established psychosocial determinants of morbidity, such as
low job control, overload, and hostility.

Policy implications

• Decision making procedures should include input

from
affected parties, and be consistently applied, unbiased,
open, correctable, and ethical.

• A prerequisite for high organisational justice is the respect-
ful and considerate treatment of individuals by their super-
visors.

• Attention to decision making procedures and interpersonal
ill health among

treatment will decrease the risk of
employees.

ﬁndings reﬂect to a great extent these people. A more detailed
analysis of the role of organisational justice for hospital physi-
cians, who were under represented in the ﬁrst survey, is
planned to be carried out with larger samples. During the
study period, there was a slight decline in procedural and
relational justice, which is congruent with the general decline
in quality of work life in Finland.24

We did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant sex differences in the
associations between components of organisational justice
and health. However, further research on this issue is still
needed in non-hospital settings and with a greater number of
male participants. Hospital occupations are highly gender
speciﬁc, making it difﬁcult to determine whether sex or occu-
pation is the cause of potential differences.

Conclusions
All the ﬁndings reported here suggest that organisational jus-
tice at work may be a crucial and independent aspect of the
psychosocial environment inﬂuencing morbidity in working
populations. The traditional focus on work characteristics,
social support, and personality has been an important ﬁrst
step, but broadening the view to managerial procedures and
treatment of individuals in organisations seems now to be
important. Such a perspective may not only increase our
understanding of psychosocial risks, but also suggest new pri-
orities for strategies of promotion of health and wellbeing at
workplaces.

.................. COMMENTARY ..................

The demand control model has been heavily inﬂuential in the
area of research on occupational stress during the 1990s.1 The
key element in it is decision latitude for employees—that is,
the possibility for employees to inﬂuence their own working
conditions. The idea behind this is that the work environment
may or may not provide opportunity for the employees to have
a say in decisions related to their own work. This has mostly
been measured by means of self administered questionnaires
with general questions about authority over decisions and
intellectual discretion. Few attempts have been made to test
the signiﬁcance of other related concepts which could expand
the original model. Kivimäki et al have now tested the idea
that organisational justice may be a crucial concept of this
kind. Accordingly they have tested one index related to proce-
dural justice and another index related to relational justice.

The ﬁrst one is clearly related to decision authority in the
original demand control model, but the four questions deal
with procedures used at the work site and the extent to which
they create clarity and consistency for the employees around
decisions at work. The other one is more close to supervisor
support at work since all four questions deal with the supervi-
sor’s function and whether he/she is able to deal with the
employee in a respectful and fair way. Kivimäki et al have
tested the ability of these two indices to predict sickness
absence, minor psychiatric morbidity, and self rated health,
and they have done so in 416 male and 3357 female hospital
employees in Finland from 1998 (baseline) to 2000.

The results of multivariate analyses showed that procedural
justice and relational justice were both predictors of poor
health, even when the concomitant effects of authority over
decisions, skill discretion, workload (closely corresponding to
demands in the demand control model), social support, and
hostility had been adjusted for. Adjustments had also been
done for current
smoking, high alcohol consumption,
sedentary lifestyle, and obesity. The results indicated that pro-
cedural justice was in general more important to health than
relational
justice, except for medically certiﬁed sickness
absence for which the reverse was true—relational justice was
more important. The odds ratios were rather small, but still
potentially important from a public health point of view. The
three components of the demand control model, workload,
decision authority, and skill discretion, also contributed to
predictions of the three health outcomes, but the patterns
were different. High work load and low decision authority
were particularly important to minor psychiatric morbidity
during follow up, whereas low skill discretion was of particu-
lar importance to self rated health. Social support at work was
not predictive of health, whereas hostility was a predictor of
minor psychiatric morbidity. It is important to note that the
contributions of these different factors were adjusted for one
another. Accordingly, a signiﬁcant effect of one of them on
health could not be explained by the others. It is particularly
interesting that hostility was included as an explanatory fac-
tor. When associations between a psychosocial variable and an
outcome variable has been found it can always be argued that
the real explanation may be a personality variable. Certain
personality traits could increase the likelihood that partici-
pants who complain about many things in life are likely to
complain both about work and about health, and hence trivial
associations will arise. In addition the new dimensions
predicted independently of the old demand control model.
Hence procedural justice, in the form it has been proposed by
the authors, is not merely a new version of the old demand
control model, but something new.

Warnings about lack of generalisability have to be issued.
The study has been made in one country and in one group of
employees (hospital employees) who represent one kind of
public sector workers. The study was made during a post-crisis
period in Finland and it is possible, for instance, that
procedural fairness may have been considered particularly
crucial during this period. There was a female dominance
among the participants and therefore we do not know
whether the results are applicable to men. Despite all these
limitations it is my hope that these methods will be utilised by
other researchers. In particular the concept procedural justice
may be very useful since it reﬂects the employees’ perception
of the effort that the organisation makes in order to create
good decision authority for them. The original concept
decision authority is more global since the total perception of
the possibility to inﬂuence decisions may also be inﬂuenced
by, for instance, work tasks, other employees, and possible
patients/customers. Labour and ﬁnancial markets are of
profound importance as well.

How is procedural justice inﬂuencing health? Firstly we
need to know whether this new concept
is related to
physiological outcome variables. Future research will certainly

explore this. A low decision latitude (the combination of intel-
lectual discretion and decision authority) in combination with
high psychological demands (job strain) has been shown to be

related to blood pressure regulation.2
procedural justice is related to health outcomes in similar
ways—through physiological stress mechanisms. More indi-
rect ways are also possible, for instance through effects on
coping mechanisms. In a study which we performed some
years ago within the framework of the epidemiological study
WOLF, we explored how employees cope with situations at
work characterised as “being treated in an unfair way” by
either colleagues or by superiors.3 The ﬁndings indicated that
decision latitude was of marked signiﬁcance to ways of coping
with this situation. When decision latitude was small,
employees were much more likely to cope in a less open and
more covert way. We could put it in a more blunt way: employ-
ees who found that they had no say and that it did not matter
what opinions they had were less likely to tell the person who
had treated them in this unfair way about their feelings of
being humiliated. It could be that the associations with proce-
dural justice and relational justice would be even stronger.
Particularly among middle aged men, a high degree of covert
coping was related to high blood pressure in the WOLF study.
It is possible that procedural injustice becomes internalised.
After some time, workers exposed to an organisation that does
not take the opinions of the workers into account will stop
discussing problems (and possibilities!) with their leaders. In

the long run this will lead not only to health problems for the
employees but also to lost creativity in the organisation. The
democracy fundamentals are at stake in this research—which
seems to be of vital importance. In the future we shall need
research on other occupational groups and in other countries,
on men as well as on women, and we need to know about the
signiﬁcance of organisational justice, not only to broad health
indicators but also to physiological outcomes, as well as to
creativity and long term survival of people and organisations.
This kind of research could give us clues to the broader
health inequity question: Why is it that lower socioeconomic
strata of the population have higher morbidity and mortality?
Organisational injustice may contribute to this.

First aiders need to raise their game

First aiders to youth football league clubs must raise their knowledge and standards to provide proper

safeguards for players. Results disclosed by a preliminary survey prompt its author to call for the
Football Association (FA)—UK football’s governing body—and the Health and Safety Executive to

list ﬁrst aid equipment, facilities, and qualiﬁed staff for clubs to access.

and

for link to this
full article.

Thirty four percent (86/250) of ﬁrst aiders responded to the questionnaire. Almost three quarters of
them had been involved in football for up to 10 years, and half with the 8–11 year age group, but 60% had
no current ﬁrst aid qualiﬁcation. Their responses to a range of hypothetical injury scenarios was
patchy—and holding a current qualiﬁcation did not guarantee a correct answer. Three quarters did not
judge themselves competent to cope with a diabetic attack, and around half an asthma attack, epileptic
ﬁt, or a fracture. Respondents judged the equipment available at games and training sessions as satisfac-
tory, even though various items that should be standard were lacking. About 40% kept health records on
the players but only 19% kept injury reports. Written parental consent to emergency treatment was held
by only 30%.

The questionnaire, with a letter of explanation, was sent to clubs in two youth football leagues—in the

midlands and northern England—to be forwarded to the club’s ﬁrst aider.

Neither the FA, nor Sports Coach UK, in its code of ethics and conduct, requires a sports ﬁrst aid quali-

ﬁcation. Nevertheless, UK law places liability with both the ﬁrst aider and the club.
