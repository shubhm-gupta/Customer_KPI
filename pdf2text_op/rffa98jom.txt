Abstract

We present research that contributes to the debate on the universal applicability of quality management, and in doing so,
subject the ‘one size fits all’ assumption underlying quality management to an empirical examination. Specifically, with the
.
exception of enhancements in instrumentation, we attempted to replicate, as closely as possible, Anderson et al.’s 1995
empirical evaluation of a Deming-based theory of quality management. In our replication, we applied path analysis to
secondary, plant-level data provided by a stratified sample of plants in three different industries in Italy. The path analytical
results from the current replication study were compared against those reported in Anderson et al. 1995 , which used data
from U.S.-based plants. These results were then discussed in the context of conducting and interpreting cross-cultural quality
management research. We concluded with the need for more replication studies in the quality management discipline and
with implications for research and practice. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

(cid:14)

Despite the paucity of scientific evidence attesting
to the effectiveness of W. Edwards Deming’s quality
management approach see Deming, 1986, 1993 , it
has received considerable attention from manufactur-
ing and service organizations around the world see
Hodgson, 1987 . In part, this is because Deming has
often been credited with contributing to Japan’s eco-
nomic revitalization after World War II Deming,
1986; Walton, 1986; Yoshida, 1989 . Deming’s qual-

there are also scholars who question the

Garvin, 1986; Goonatilake, 1988; Yoshida, 1989;
Amundson et al., 1997; Mersha, 1997 . Goonatilake
(cid:14)
1988 and Mersha 1997 have argued, for example,
that developing countries possess a host of sociopo-
litical and socioeconomic factors that
the
transferability of quality management concepts, prin-
ciples, and techniques to these countries. With re-
spect to the Deming Management Method, Yoshida
(cid:14)
1989 argued that certain cultural constraints hinder
the widespread applicability of the Deming Manage-
ment Method in the U.S. and other Western civiliza-
tions. Garvin 1986, p. 669 also had the following
caution:
firms to mimic
Japanese quality practices without first adapting them
to local conditions are unlikely to be completely
successful, even though practices in both countries
were originally derived from the same sources.’’

In this paper, we present research that contributes

to the debate on the universal applicability of quality
management, and in doing so, subject the ‘one size
fits all’ assumption see Newman and Nollen, 1996;
p. 753 of quality management to an empirical exam-
ination. We intend our research to be a stimulus into
more theoretical and empirical investigations of when
and where quality management might be applicable,
as well as how quality management might need to be
adapted in its application. Specifically, we present
the replication results of an empirical evaluation of a
Deming-based theory of quality management. This
theory was recently articulated by Anderson et al.
(cid:14)
1994b and subsequently subjected to an empirical
.
examination in the work of Anderson et al. 1995 .
Except for enhancements in instrumentation, we at-
tempted to replicate, as closely as possible, the An-

apply path analysis to secondary, plant-level, data
provided by a stratified sample of plants in three

2. A Deming-based theory of quality management

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

Anderson et al. 1994b recently articulated an
integrative theory of quality management to describe
and explain the process and effectiveness of adopting
the Deming Management Method henceforth re-
.
ferred to as the ARS theory of quality management .
.
In their theory development, Anderson et al. 1994b
identified and defined seven constructs as forming
the theoretical blocks for describing, explaining, and
predicting the organizational performance impact of
quality management adoption. These seven con-
structs—Visionary Leadership, Internal and External
Cooperation, Learning, Process Management, Con-
tinuous Improvement, Employee Fulfillment, and
Customer Satisfaction—were derived from a concep-
tual synthesis of literature on the Deming Manage-

ment Method and from the input of a panel of
subject-matter-experts identified from both academia
and industry. Table 1 reproduces the nominal defini-
tions for the seven constructs.

In theorizing the organizational performance im-
pact of quality management adoption, Anderson et
al. 1994b, pp. 479–480 postulated that the effec-
tiveness of adopting Deming’s quality management
approach:

.

(cid:14)

. . . arises from leadership efforts toward the simulta-
neous creation of a cooperative and learning organi-
zation to facilitate the implementation of process-
management practices, which, when implemented,
support customer satisfaction and organizational sur-
vival
through sustained employee fulfillment and
continuous improvement of processes, products, and
services . . .

Captured in this succinct statement are four proposi-
tions specifying the ‘causal’ relationships among the
seven constructs that had been identified:

Proposition 1: Visionary leadership enables the si-
multaneous creation of a cooperative and learning
organization.

Proposition 2: An organization that simultaneously
fosters cooperation and learning facilitates the imple-
mentation of process management practices.

Proposition 3: Process management practices simul-
taneously result in continuous improvement of qual-
ity and employee fulfillment.

Proposition 4: An organization’s simultaneous ef-
forts continuously to improve its quality and to fulfill
its employees lead to higher customer satisfaction.

Proposition 1 stresses the critical role that leader-
ship plays in ensuring the success of quality manage-
ment adoption. Proposition 2 emphasizes the impor-
tance of both cooperation and continual learning in
helping an organization to implement process man-
agement practices that include both human resource
management practices e.g., teams and methodolog-
(cid:14)

ical approaches

Proposition 3 describes the two immediate outcomes
of continuous quality improvement and employee
fulfillment that an organization derives from effec-
tive implementation methodological and human re-

Theoretical constructs and nominal definitions From Anderson et al., 1994b; p. 480

(cid:14)

Visionary Leadership
The ability of management to establish, practice, and lead a long-term vision for the organization, driven by changing customer
requirements, as opposed to an internal management control role

Internal and External Cooperation
The propensity of the organization to engage in non-competitive activities internally among employees and externally with respect to
suppliers

Learning
The organizational capability to recognize and nurture the development of its skills, abilities, and knowledge bases

Process Management
The set of methodological and behavioral practices emphasizing the management of process, or means of actions, rather than results

Continuous Impro˝ement
The propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements of its processes, products, and services

Employee Fulfillment
The degree to which employees of an organization feel that the organization continually satisfies their needs

Customer Satisfaction
The degree to which an organization’s customers continually perceive that their needs are being met by the organization’s products and
services

sources management practices underlying Process
Management. Proposition 4 theorizes that continu-
ously improving quality and fulfilling employees
represent requisite conditions that, in turn, contribute
to an organization’s ability to satisfy its present
customers and, at the same time, to identify opportu-
nities for satisfying future customers. Together, these
four propositions depict the path diagram in Fig. 1.
.
In a subsequent paper, Anderson et al. 1995
reported the results for an empirical examination of
the four propositions comprising their theory of qual-
ity management. These empirical results were based
on a secondary data source provided by U.S. plants
in Round 1 of
the World-Class Manufacturing
(cid:14)
.WCM research project. Data for the WCM research
project were collected from multiple informants
(cid:14)eight different managers, three supervisors, and 10
.
workers
in 41 plants via pen-and-paper question-
naires. Different informants received questionnaires
with different content measurement items. For in-
stance,
the human resources manager received a
questionnaire asking about the plant’s approach to
issues of
training, compensation, selection, etc.,
whereas, the process engineer responded to questions
about process design and control. The majority of
these measurement items were structured as percep-
tual questions with forced-choice response formats,
but several measurement items, asking for factual,
(cid:14)
.
quantifiable data
e.g., scrap rate , were also in-
cluded in the relevant questionnaires.

To empirically examine the ARS theory of quality
management, Anderson et al. 1995 performed four

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

sequential tasks. First, they selected perceptual mea-
surement items from Round 1 of the WCM research
project in order to create multi-item measurement
scales for each of the seven constructs. The internal
consistency reliability and dimensionality of these
measurement scales were respectively assessed by
computing and evaluating Cronbach’s a coefficient
(cid:14)
see Cronbach, 1951 and by interpreting the results
of exploratory factor analysis with no rotation, with
these results indicating acceptable reliability and
.
uni-dimensionality. Second, Anderson et al. 1995
constructed plant-by-plant, composite scores for each
of the seven constructs. These aggregate scores were
computed by firstly averaging the responses of dif-
ferent within-plant informants to the same measure-
ment item. Then the measurement items within the
same measurement scale were averaged by plant.
Each construct, therefore, had a vector of 41 com-
posite scores, one for each plant. Third, Anderson et
al. 1995 conducted an analysis of industry effects
on the mean and variance levels of the empirical
measures for the seven constructs. Industry effects
were found to be significant in explaining differ-
ences across the three industries and were subse-
quently controlled for by standardizing the data by
industry. Fourth, path analysis was applied to the
standardized-by-industry data to compute eight path
coefficients, two for each of the four propositions.
Direct, indirect, and unexplained effects were then
decomposed from the observed correlation among
the empirical measures for the seven constructs and
the path analytical results. In summary,
the path

analytical results supported Propositions 1 and 3, but
provided only partial support for Propositions 2 and
4.

3. The present replication study

.

(cid:14)

Since our intent is to conduct a constructive repli-
cation of the Anderson et al. 1995 study, we at-
tempted to maximize the similarities between this
replication and the earlier study. Two differences,
however, deserve further clarification, these being
the source of data for this replication and the opera-
tionalization of the seven constructs.

3.1. Round 2 of the WCM research project: Italian
plants

(cid:14)

.

Whereas data for the Anderson et al. 1995 study
were provided by Round 1 of the WCM research
project, data for this replication came from Italian
plants that were studied in Round 2 of the WCM
research project. The WCM research project was a
multi-year project to develop a better understanding
of what world-class manufacturing practices in-
cluded and how these practices would affect organi-
zational performance. ‘World-Class Manufacturing,’
for the project, was defined based on the writings of
Hayes and Wheelwright 1985 and Schonberger

(cid:14)
1986 . Round 1 data were collected from U.S.
plants during 1989 and 1990. A recent description of
Round 1 of the WCM project can be found in the
work of Flynn et al. 1997 . Round 2 of the WCM
project extended data collection to plants in other
countries, including Italy, Japan, Germany, and the
United Kingdom. The Italian plant data were col-
lected during 1992. When the current replication
study began in 1995, only the data from the Italian
plants had been completed, cleaned, and made avail-
able to the researchers.

For Round 2, the various questionnaires that were
employed in Round 1 were modified and improved.
Table 2 provides a breakdown of the total number of
questionnaires employed in Round 2, the total num-
ber of different employees that answered these ques-
tionnaires, and the total number of informants from
each plant.

A panel of five Italian academic experts on manu-
facturing management then engaged in an iterative
process to translate these modified questionnaires
from English into Italian. All translation disagree-
ments were resolved via a group process involving
all five experts. A professional
translator, whose
native language was English, then back translated the
Italian versions into English in order to verify the
equivalence of the Italian versions to the English
versions. As a final check, the Italian questionnaires
were reviewed and pre-tested with a small group of

three non-academic individuals to assess whether or
not the questionnaires could be answered by individ-
uals with limited education, with two of these indi-
viduals having received only a secondary level edu-
cation.

In building the sample of Italian plants, only
manufacturing companies from the Machine Tools,
Electronics, and Transportation-Related industries
were considered;
this strategy allowed the Italian
sample to be comparable with the U.S. sample from
Round 1 of the WCM research project. Furthermore,
these companies had to have manufacturing facilities
located in Italy and to employ at least 100 employ-
ees. Companies with these characteristics were then
classified as either ‘Traditional’ or ‘World-Class,’
based on the opinions of 10 experts and on their
organizational profiles in Italian trade journals. The
10 experts included academic researchers, consul-
tants, and industry managers, with expertise in par-
ticular industrial sectors andror managerial aspects
of WCM. Italian trade journals were used to expand
the list of possible WCM firms, and in some cases,
to confirm the ‘World-Class’ status of companies
that had been identified by experts. To ensure the
integrity of the classification, a face-to-face meeting
was arranged so that the 10 experts could discuss the
classification results. During this discussion, when-
ever doubts arose as to a firm’s designation as
‘World-Class,’ evidence that
the firm had imple-
mented some WCM practices, either from trade jour-
nals or from expert knowledge, had to be provided.
Otherwise, the firm would not be included in the
sampling frame.

From this sampling frame, the Italian WCM re-
search team in Italy then contacted 85 companies by
phone and by mail to explain the research program
and objectives. Thirty companies refused to partici-
pate; these 30 companies were either facing major
restructuring problems or had defense contracts that
prohibited them from sharing sensitive company-re-
lated information. The remaining 55 companies
(cid:14)
65% selected one plant to participate in Round 2 of
the WCM research project. Generally,
the ‘best’
plant was selected. A plant research coordinator from
each selected plant was appointed to serve as a
liaison between the plant and the Italian WCM re-
search team. Plant visits were scheduled with each of
the 55 plants, during which the research objectives

.

and design were explained and interviews were con-
ducted with the plant research coordinators and vari-
ous managers within the plants.

During initial plant visits, the plant research coor-
dinator, along with at least one member of the Italian
WCM research team, would jointly select the plant
informants to answer the various questionnaires, with
the exception of the three questionnaires for direct
labor. In the case of direct labor, because of the
promise of anonymity, the names of employees were
kept anonymous, although the selection process at-
tempted to include both union and non-union repre-
sentation. Questionnaires would then be administered
to the selected informants by the plant research
coordinator and returned to the plant research coordi-
nator who then forwarded the completed question-
naires to the research team.

Of the 55 plants that had been visited, 10 dropped
out for various reasons discovered during or after the
visit. Some plant research coordinators did not wish
to continue after learning of the research objectives
and design, citing a lack of interest or believing that
the data were too sensitive. Some agreed to partici-
pate but were not able to guarantee sufficient com-
pleteness of the various questionnaires to warrant
further consideration. Finally, some agreed to admin-
ister the questionnaires but heavy production de-
mands prevented the timely administration of the
questionnaires for inclusion into Round 2 of the
WCM project.

The remaining 45 plants that agreed to participate
in the WCM study did return their questionnaires,
but
the questionnaire sets from two plants were
discarded because of excessive missing data. The
final sample, therefore, contained 43 plants of which
38 are Italian-owned plants, 2 are American-owned
plants, 2 are French-owned plants, and 1 is a Ger-
man-owned plant. The distribution of these plants
across
‘Traditional’ vs.
‘World-Class’ categories is shown in Table 3.

questionnaires. Many of the measurement items em-
ployed in the Anderson et al. 1995 study were
retained, with exceptions noted in Appendix A. These
exceptions included the addition of new measure-
ment items to, andror the deletion of measurement
items from, the measurement scales used in Ander-
son et al. 1995 . In general, the addition andror
deletion of measurement items were undertaken to
maximize the internal consistency reliability and the
dimensionality of the respective measurement scales,
an approach suggested in the work by Churchill
(cid:14)
1979 and successfully applied by Graham et al.
(cid:14)
1994 . Table 4 shows Cronbach’s a coefficients
and principal components factor analysis results for
these modified measurement scales.

.
.

The data for the measurement scales were then
used to create plant-level aggregate scores for each
construct, following the approach in Anderson et al.
(cid:14)
1995 . First, the average score for each item was
computed across all within-plant
informants who
responded to the item. Then, the measurement items

.

constituting each measurement scale were averaged
by plant to form an aggregate, plant-level score for
the corresponding theoretical construct. Each con-
struct, therefore, has 43 values, one per plant, with
the exception of Employee Fulfillment, which has
only 34 values due to missing data.

3.3. Hypotheses

The four propositions in the ARS theory of qual-
ity management can be restated as eight
testable
hypotheses. For example, stated in standard null
form, Proposition 1 suggests the following two hy-
potheses, as follows.

Hypothesis 1: Visionary Leadership is not positively
related to Internal and External Cooperation.

Hypothesis 2: Visionary Leadership is not positively
related to Learning.

is not posi-

3.4. Analytical approach

In this replication, the eight hypotheses were em-
pirically examined by applying the method of path
analysis to the data from the Italian plants see Land,
1969; Li, 1975 for an introduction to the theory and
mechanics of path analysis . In the context of path
analysis, the eight hypotheses can be operationalized
as the path diagram shown in Fig. 2. The two arrows

(cid:14)

.

from Visionary Leadership to Internal and External
Cooperation and from Visionary Leadership to
Learning are, therefore, consistent with Hypotheses 1
and 2, respectively.

Because the 43 plants were drawn from three
different industries, industry effects were suspected
to play a significant role in explaining the variation
in the data, just as industry effects were significant in
the Anderson et al. 1995 study. This suspicion was
confirmed by analyzing the across-industry mean
and variance levels for the empirical measures of the
seven constructs see Table 5 . To remove industry
effects, the data were standardized by industry.

To apply path analysis, the data were standardized
again and regression analysis was then employed to
estimate the magnitudes of the eight path coefficients
in Fig. 2. Because path coefficients are equivalent to
standardized regression coefficients Wright, 1960;
see also the work of Li, 1975 , the statistical signifi-
cance of path coefficients can be examined using
conventional t-tests and the statistical significance of
hypothesized relationships can be evaluated by inter-

for the eight

and unexplained effects between empirical measures

and 7, respectively that were minimally beyond the
standard as0.05 level of significance; these two
paths were, therefore, considered to be statistically
significant for this study. Three of the eight hypothe-
sized paths—from Learning to Process Management
(cid:14)
Hypothesis 4 , from Process Management to Em-
(cid:14)
ployee Fulfillment Hypothesis 6 and from Em-
ployee Fulfillment
to Customer Satisfaction Hy-
pothesis 8 —did not support statistically significant
path coefficients. Therefore, in the context of the
four theoretical propositions, only Proposition 1 re-
ceived full empirical support, whereas the remaining
three propositions received mixed empirical support.
Table 7 reports the decomposition of the empiri-
cal correlation coefficients into direct, indirect, and
unexplained effects. For example,
the correlation
between empirical measures for Visionary Leader-
p -
ship and Continuous Improvement is 0.493
0.001 , but the path model in Fig. 2 hypothesized an
indirect relationship between Visionary Leadership
and Continuous Improvement, with this indirect ef-

(cid:14)

.

fect amounting to 0.122. Therefore, Fig. 2, as hy-
pothesized, explained only 24.7% of the observed
correlation between Visionary Leadership and Con-
tinuous
Improvement. Consequently, Visionary
Leadership may affect Continuous Improvement ei-
ther directly i.e., a direct path exists between the
two or in some other indirect manner via another
variable that is not currently included in the path
diagram. The decomposition results for the empirical
measures of other constructs in Fig. 2 can be inter-
preted in a similar manner.

Finally, Table 8 compares the replication results
for the Italian plants to the results for the U.S. plants
in Anderson et al. 1995 . As highlighted in Table 8,
consistent empirical support for four of the eight
hypothesized paths can be observed between the
U.S. sample and the Italian sample. For plants in
both the U.S. and Italian samples, Visionary Leader-
ship was observed to have a positive and statistically
significant effect on Internal and External Coopera-
tion Hypothesis 1 . Likewise, Internal and External

For two of the remaining four hypothesized paths,
minor differences were detected. For example, Hy-
pothesis 2, which relates Visionary Leadership to
Learning, received strong empirical support in the
Anderson et al. 1995 study—a path coefficient of
0.46 that was statistically significant at p -0.002.
But, for the Italian data, the path coefficient from
Visionary Leadership to Learning was statistically
significant at p -0.056 only. As for Hypothesis 6,
the U.S. sample provided weak support for the path
from Process Management to Employee Fulfillment,
path coefficients0.27, p -0.085 ; whereas,
(cid:14)
this
relationship was not statistically supported in this
replication. However, when interpreted in a more
conservative manner
it could be
argued that Hypothesis 6 would have been rejected
for both samples of U.S. and Italian plants.

5. Discussion of results

(cid:14)

.

To date, the Anderson et al. 1995 study is the
only empirical examination of the ARS theory of
quality management. While there have been other
empirical studies of quality management, these em-
pirical studies have been based on other quality
management frameworks e.g., Flynn et al., 1995;
.
Hendricks and Singhal, 1996; Powell, 1995 .

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

Considered from the typology of management
studies involving culture by Adler 1983 , the Ander-
son et al. 1995 study represents a parochial study,
since the research was conducted in one culture
(cid:14)
U.S. context by researchers in that culture U.S.-
trained researchers . According to Adler 1983, p.
.32 , a parochial study typically makes the implicit
assumption that the underlying theory and resulting
empirical findings are universal, when, in fact, they
are most likely:

.

. . . applicable only to one culture,
the culture in
which the research was conducted . . . American stud-
ies conducted in the United States are, at best appli-
cable to the United States. They may or may not be

South America.

formative indicators, see Fornell and Bookstein,
1982 . Likewise, in this replication, we maximized
Cronbach’s a for the Italian sample, and in our
empirical analysis, operationalized theoretical con-
structs as aggregate scores formed by averaging indi-
vidual measurement items.

.

Therefore, in order to assess whether a theory is
potentially applicable outside of one culture, Adler
(cid:14)
1983 urged that research designs explicitly incor-
porate and evaluate the impact of culture, one sug-
gested research design being ethnocentric research.
Ethnocentric research designs:

w

u n d e r

th e m o re

. . . ask the question: ‘Can this theory, which is appli-
cable in Culture A be extended to Culture B?’ . . . and
xare primarily searching for similarity across cultural
conditions, for validation in extending . . . theoretical

conditions . . . with replications being . . . the most
common approach to ethnocentric research . . . an at-
tempt is made to keep all aspects of the research
design and its implementation with the exception of
language identical across the two cultures. As far as
possible, the research is conducted in the same way,
with the same types of people, using the same instru-
mentation except for language , administered with
the same instructions, and analyzed using the same
.
methods in both cultures . . . Adler, 1983, p. 33 .

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

From the preceding description, it is clear that the
conduct of the empirical study reported herein ap-
proximates ethnocentric research. The detraction
from an ideal ethnocentric research design arises
because the data collection instrument employed in
this replication differed from that used in Anderson
et al. 1995 . However, differences in instrumenta-
tion do not necessarily deter cross-cultural compar-
isons in management research, a case in point being
the examination of negotiation behavior in multiple
countries by Graham et al. 1994 . Because Cron-
bach’s a’s for several constructs were unacceptably
.
low for several foreign samples, Graham et al. 1994
deleted relevant measurement items on a country-
by-country basis to maximize Cronbach’s a’s and
employed formative measurement indicators to oper-
ationalize theoretical constructs for a discussion of

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

.

(cid:14)

Furthermore, from a cross-cultural comparative
perspective, Hofstede 1984 has shown that
the
Italian culture differs from the U.S. culture along
such cultural dimensions as Power Distance higher
.
in Italy , Uncertainty Avoidance higher in Italy ,
Individualism lower
in Italy , and Masculinity
(cid:14)
higher in Italy . Because the U.S. and Italian cul-
tures are dissimilar, observed similarities between
the research results in this replication and those in
the Anderson et al. 1995 study can be conserva-
tively interpreted to be indicative of possible, rather
than confirming, universality. More precisely, Adler
(cid:14)
1983, p. 34 has provided the following caution:

(cid:14)
.

.

(cid:14)

.

.

In cross-cultural replication studies, similar findings
are most frequently interpreted as confirmation that
x
the theory being tested is, in fact, universal . . . the
more appropriate conclusion would be either that the
particular results are not solely dependent on cultural
factors in the first culture or that the results appear
applicable to the second culture. The conclusion,
from a two-culture study, that the results are univer-
sal is unwarranted.

w

With this caution in mind, it can be concluded
that several of the hypothesized relationships in the
ARS theory of quality management appear to be
applicable in describing, explaining, and predicting
‘quality management’-related organizational forms
(cid:14)
.
i.e., in Italy .
and behavior beyond the U.S. context
In both the U.S. and the Italian contexts, organiza-
tional leaders play a critical role in developing and
communicating a vision that can enable the creation
of an organizational system—one that is cooperative
in nature and willing to engage in learning. Coopera-
tion, in turn, makes it easier to implement practices
that focus on managing the process as opposed to
managing the outcomes of the process. These pro-
cess management practices ultimately support
the
continuous improvement of process, product, and
service quality.

(cid:14)

Also, in both the U.S. and Italy, Learning did not
appear to facilitate the implementation of process
management practices, as conjectured. However, the
failure to observe a statistically significant relation-
ship between Learning and Process Management may
be attributed to the effects of multi-collinearity, since
Learning and Internal and External Cooperation were
observed to be positively and statistically correlated.
In Anderson et al. 1995, p. 650 , the zero-order
correlation between Learning and Internal and Exter-
.
nal Cooperation was found to be 0.76 p -0.001 ;
whereas, for this replication sample, a correlation of
p -0.001 was computed. Another possible
0.604
explanation, however, may be the inadequate opera-
tionalization of the Learning construct’s domain.
Deming 1990 and others e.g., Anderson et al.,
1992, 1994a have urged organizations to supple-
ment
training in domain or task knowledge with
training and education in ‘profound knowledge’ i.e.,
systems theory, statistics, psychology, and theory of
knowledge . In their urgings, these scholars argued
that
training and education in the disciplines of
‘profound knowledge’ are critical to effective contin-
uous quality improvement efforts. Yet, in both the
Anderson et al. 1995 study and the current replica-
tion, the Learning construct could only be opera-
tionalized as task-related training.

(cid:14)

Whereas similar findings in cross-cultural replica-
tions support the applicability of a particular theory
across different cultures, inconsistent findings across
different cultures should arguably lead to the conclu-
sion that the particular theory does not apply across
different cultures. Such a conclusion seems appropri-
ate for the hypothesized relationships involving the
Employee Fulfillment construct in the ARS theory of
quality management. However, the same logic about
not drawing conclusions of universality based on
similar findings from a two-culture study can be
made in the case of differences in the comparative
results of two cultures. Furthermore, as Shenkar and
von Glinow 1994; p. 68 demonstrated in studying
the applicability of different theories in China, there
may be ‘ . . . degrees of applicability . . . ’—these de-
grees of applicability possibly arising because of one
or more of the following conditions: a the assump-
tions underlying the theory do not hold in different
cultures, b problems in conceptualization or instru-
(cid:14) .
mentation, c marginal empirical support, and d

(cid:14) .

(cid:14) .

(cid:14) .

.

(cid:14)

missing constructs in the theory being tested. Hence,
observed differences in the Employee Fulfillment
results reported here and in the Anderson et al.
(cid:14)
1995 study may be attributed to one or more of
these conditions.

.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

In retrospect, we suspect that the conceptualiza-
tion of Employee Fulfillment, defined as the degree
to which employees are able to derive pride from the
workmanship, satisfaction, and commitment from
.
what they do see Anderson et al., 1994b; p. 489 ,
may not be applicable in the Italian culture for two
reasons. First, as computed in Hofstede 1984, p.
.189 , the Italian culture has a relatively high Mas-
culinity score of 70 compared to an mean of 51—a
reflection of strong Catholic tenets, that fundamen-
tally view the female gender as being secondary to
the male gender. The man, being the primary provider
in a family, is under societal pressure to be a source
of financial resources, and is motivated more by
extrinsic benefits such as wages and bonuses than by
pride of workmanship Bonazzi, 1993 . Second, since
the end of the Second World War, the Italian indus-
trial work environment has been influenced strongly
by Marxism. Marxist ideology has led to a clear
demarcation between employers and employees and
unions , resulting in both sides maintaining a tradi-
tional ‘arm’s length’ approach in dealing with one
another. On one hand, employees generally do not
believe that management is concerned for their wel-
fare and are extremely wary of management initia-
tives that relate to the work they do. On the other
hand, employers are more inclined to devise extrin-
sic, as opposed to intrinsic, modes to motivate and
satisfy the workforce see Pinaud, 1992; Gunnigle et
.
al., 1994; Sirianni, 1995; Hardy and Clegg, 1996 .
Therefore, the lack of empirical support for hypothe-
sized relationships involving Employee Fulfillment
in the Italian data may arise not because these rela-
tionships are conceptually invalid but, perhaps, be-
cause the Employee Fulfillment construct itself does
not have definitional equivalence from the U.S. con-
text to the Italian context.

surprise to observe that in the quality management
discipline, there are virtually no replication studies of
previously published results. Yet,
the conduct of
replication studies has long been recognized as being
crucial to the ongoing process of scientific inquiry
and to the development and growth of scientific
knowledge within a given discipline see Lykken,
.
1968; Reynolds, 1971 .

In this respect, our replication, although not a
.
‘pure’ replication of the Anderson et al. 1995
study, does make a unique contribution to the disci-
pline of quality management—it represents the first
explicit attempt
to determine ‘‘ . . . whether or
not . . . the empirical results reported in Anderson et
x
al. 1995 are . . . potentially generalizable at all’’
(cid:14)
Lindsay and Ehrenberg, 1993, p. 217 . We believe
that more replications are necessary and should be
encouraged before any conclusive statements, either
in favor or against, the proposed Deming-based the-
ory of quality management can and should be made.
According to Lykken 1968, p. 155 : . . . demonstrat-
ing an empirical fact ‘‘must
involve a chain of
confidence in the replicability of one’s findings . . . ,’’
such confidence naturally resulting from numerous
attempts to falsify previously reported findings.
Hence, we urge that future research efforts not only
replicate the earlier Anderson et al. 1995 study
with a different U.S.-based sample, either within the
same or in different sets of industries, but also
replicate the current study involving Italian organiza-
tions. Ideally, simultaneous empirical examinations
of the ARS theory of quality management across
multiple cultures should be pursued. To do so, re-
searchers in quality management need to develop
critical understanding and appreciation of
the
methodological issues involved in conducting cross-
cultural empirical research. Many of these issues
have been raised and discussed in the works of
Mullen 1995 , Singh 1995 , Riordan and Vanden-
(cid:14)
berg 1994 , and, more recently, Cavusgil and Das
(cid:14)
.
1997 .

While existing empirical studies on the relation-
ships conceptualized in the ARS theory of quality
management have been informative, from a research
standpoint, we want to encourage the design and
conduct of confirmatory, as opposed to exploratory,

empirical tests of the ARS theory of quality manage-
ment. A critical challenge, however, lies ahead for
those interested in conducting such confirmatory em-
pirical studies—one that pertains to the construction
of reliable and valid methods for measuring the
seven constructs in the ARS theory of quality man-
agement. The importance of satisfying this challenge
cannot be over-emphasized; for without reliable and
valid measures that enable data collection from pri-
mary sources, the substantive validity of the relation-
ships in the ARS theory of quality management
cannot be definitively established see Bagozzi et al.,
.
1991 .

(cid:14)

From a managerial perspective, the results from
this replication should further raise awareness of the
potential cultural bounds of the quality management
phenomenon as multinational corporations make
conscious decisions to transfer the organizational
forms and behaviors underlying quality management
to other countries. This awareness should help orga-
nizations to better manage the diffusion of quality
management from the home country environment to
foreign country environments, and specifically to
identify cultural barriers that may inhibit the adop-
tion of quality management principles, concepts, and
practices.

.

(cid:14)

(cid:14)

Our research results, particularly with respect to
Employee Fulfillment, suggest that in instances where
the values underlying quality management conflict
with the values of the culture in which quality
.
management is to be diffused i.e., the target culture ,
this diffusion might be hindered see also, Amund-
son et al., 1997 . In such instances, for quality
management practices to be successfully transferred,
the conflict between values underlying quality man-
agement practices and those of the target culture
should be reconciled. Pragmatically, this reconcilia-
tion can be undertaken by adapting quality manage-
ment practices to the target culture or by selectively
implementing those quality management practices
that would be more amenable to the target culture.
Conversely, companies, through selective employee
hiring or retention and organizational development
initiatives, might be able to instill or adapt their own
organizational cultures to be more supportive of
quality management.
