This study examines the differential impact of an alignment of organizational culture
and business strategy through which inducement-HR and involvement-HR systems
may affect ﬁrm performance. It contributes to the strategic ﬁt of the HRM literature by
using empirical data from 451 ﬁrms in southern China to evaluate the linkages among
organizational culture, HR systems, business strategies and organizational perform-
ance. The results show some support for an HR-organizational culture ﬁt and an
HR-business strategy ﬁt, and have important managerial implications for matching the
organizational culture and business strategy with an organization’s choice of HR
systems to achieve maximum impact on organizational performance.

Introduction

Employee involvement plays an important role in the success of high performance
initiatives. Involvement-HR practices have been extensively researched in recent studies
(Guthrie 2001; Gollan 2005). Involvement-HR is designed to foster high levels of
autonomy, discretion, challenge and motivation, so that employees can make a meaningful
and creative contribution. Participation and empowerment
is greatly encouraged.
Employee involvement and sharing of information is relatively weak in Chinese
organizations. High power distance societies place less value on subordinate input and
participation. Chinese employees are not accustomed to active involvement
and participation. Employees are reluctant
to accept responsibility and unlikely to
exercise their initiative to get things done (Chow, Huang and Liu 2008).

Typical paternalistic employers demonstrate their care and concern for

their
employees, but expect unquestioning obedience in return (Westwood and Chan 1992).
The inducement-HR system is grounded on the nature of the employer – employee
exchange. Based on the inducement-contribution model of employment, with high level of
inducements offered by the employers, employees may feel obliged to reciprocate through
working harder and are less likely to quit (Tsui and Wu 2005). Inducement-HR systems
built around pay as an incentive work very well for Chinese ﬁrms.

From involvement to inducement, it will be interesting to ﬁnd out which type of HR
systems will be more appropriate for managing China’s massive labour force and what
types of HR systems may contribute to better performance. The purpose of this study

is to explore the extent that the involvement and inducement-HR systems could be
successfully adopted in the Chinese context.

Despite growing research interest in the important ﬁeld of strategic human resource
management (SHRM), our understanding of the relationship between HR, culture ﬁt and
business strategy is still very limited. For instance, under what conditions and to what
extent do HR systems matter? What relationship exists among strategy, culture and HR
practices and how do they combine to strengthen an organization’s competitive
advantage? In this study, we attempt to answer these questions by including organizational
culture and business strategy. The focus of the study is on cultural alignment and business
strategy alignment. Drawing on the SHRM, organizational culture and strategy theories,
this study is designed to integrate and contribute to the strategic ﬁt of the HRM literature
by using empirical data to evaluate the linkages among organizational culture, HR
systems, business strategies, and organizational performance. It also examines the
interaction effects of HR-culture and HR-strategy on ﬁrm performance. It is important to
examine the extent to which organizational culture and business strategy match an
organization’s choice of HR systems to achieve maximum impact on organizational
performance. We test the model in culture-HR linkage and business strategy-HR linkage
using responses from 451 ﬁrms in southern China.

is experiencing revolutionary change.

Three decades of economic reform have made China an attractive market for
multinational companies (MNCs) (see Warner 2008). China is becoming increasingly
integrated into the global economy, and this integration was recently symbolized by its
admission to the World Trade Organization. As China’s economy continues to develop,
the country’s business environment
In an
increasingly competitive environment, the pressure for change has placed new demands
on human resource practices. China’s emergence as a major player in the global economy
provides a very challenging research site for studying the HR systems. Results from the
present study offer some important implications for both research and practice. Its
theoretical and empirical ﬁndings will contribute to the development of global HRM
knowledge and theories, and complement the existing literature on HRM research.
The empirical results offer some evidence on the importance of the relationship among HR
practices,
interaction effects of organizational culture, business strategy and ﬁrm
performance in the world’s largest emerging market. The study’s ﬁndings are also of
practical relevance not only for local Chinese ﬁrms but also for MNCs investing in China.
The ﬁndings provide important insights for multinational business executives wishing to
design effective HRM systems and to align them with organizational culture and business
strategy to attain high performance in China.

The following section starts with a brief review of previous studies of the relationship
between HR systems and organizational culture as well as HR and business strategy.
Based on the literature review, hypotheses are developed and tested with empirical data
collected for this study. The study concludes with a discussion of the managerial
implications and suggests directions for future research.

Theoretical framework

Cabrera and Bonache (1999) asserted the need for the alignment of organizational culture
and business strategy by integrating knowledge from SHRM with the design of HR
practices. The authors stressed that an organization should improve its competitive
position through careful planning of the HR practices necessary for achieving its business
strategy. HR systems shape the behavior of employees, thus becoming the means whereby

factor

cultures are created and sustained (Schwartz and Davis 1981). A strong culture may be an
important
in obtaining a competitive advantage, but only under certain
circumstances, i.e. if the culture is appropriate. Strong positive associations are found
between organizational cultural values of respect for people, innovation, stability and
aggressiveness, and employee responses of organizational commitment, job satisfaction,
propensity to remain with the organization, and information sharing behavior (McKinnon,
Harrison, Chow and Wu 2003). The creation of norms to support an organization’s
business strategy depends on the careful design of the organization’s HR practices. It is
proposed that organizational culture, business strategy and human resource strategy each
have a differential impact on ﬁrm performance. Figure 1 illustrates the theoretical
framework we propose for the present study.

The importance of HR alignment as a basis of competitive advantage has repeatedly
been stressed in previous studies (Cabrera and Bonache 1999; Vandenberg, Richardson
and Eastman 1999; Barrette and Ouellette 2000). In high performing organizations, HRM
is treated as a set of complementary practices aligned with the ﬁrm’s goals and strategies
(Becker and Huselid 1998). Sustainable HRM systems are those which are internally
coherent, consistent with the ﬁrm’s business strategy, and consistent with the broader
context in which the ﬁrm is operating (Gollan 2005). The underlying logic is the
assumption that congruence or ﬁt would result
in organizational effectiveness
(Delery 1998).

Organizational alignment theory (Selmer 1997) and contingency theory (Schuler and
Jackson 1987; Delery and Doty 1996) posit that HRM should match the demands of
internal and external conditions in expecting organizational effectiveness. External ﬁt
links HR systems to business strategy whereas internal ﬁt focuses on complementarities
across HRM activities (Huselid, Jackson and Schuler 1997). The basic premise is that ﬁrm
performance can be enhanced to the degree that there is internal consistency among HR
practices and compatibility of HR practices with a ﬁrm’s strategy (Youndt, Snell, Dean
and Lepak 1996; Wright and Snell 1998). Therefore integrating the HR system with a
ﬁrm’s business strategy is conducive to the enhancement of organizational effectiveness,
particularly for a high commitment work system.

HR systems and performance

The strategic perspective of HRM and the systems approach of designing HR practices
are the two most dominant research approaches on HRM-ﬁrm performance linkage
(Bowen and Ostroff 2004). SHRM research focuses on evaluating the congruence among
business strategies, HRM policies and organizational effectiveness (Dyer and Holder
1988; Wright, McMahan and McWilliams 1994). The value of HRM and its impact on
organizational effectiveness may be magniﬁed when the HRM practices of an organization
support the ﬁrm’s ability to establish and maintain a match in internal and external
demands. The philosophy of SHRM emphasizes the need to achieve coordination and
integration between organizational culture, HR systems, business strategy, and corporate
goals (Schuler 1992). The systems approach views HR practices as internally coherent,
consistent with the ﬁrm’s corporate strategy. It is the system of HR practices that
inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s performance.
Dyer and Holder’s (1988)

typology classiﬁed HR systems into investment,
involvement and inducement, each ﬁtting a particular business strategy and corporate
culture. An empirical study by Swiercz (1995) conﬁrmed the validity of the inducement
and involvement systems but failed to support the notion of investment-HR. The present
study investigates only the two validated HR systems, i.e., inducement and involvement.
Inducement-HR puts a strong focus on containing cost. It maintains efﬁciency by
narrowly deﬁning jobs, and builds a strong link between each worker’s effort and his pay.
Inducement-HR builds around incentives, using performance-based pay as an attempt to
monitor and control employee performance. It has been amply demonstrated that
incentives raise productivity and proﬁtability and decrease the mobility of workers
(Beer and Katz 2003). The introduction of performance-related pay schemes has
substantially improved ﬁrm performance. Inducement plans need continuous management
support and monitoring. Performance-related pay cannot be directly linked to an increase
in participation of employees in decision-making in Finland (Piekkola 2005). High
involvement HR systems, based on industrial democracy and self-management work
teams, require more autonomy, greater task variety, and more effective use of knowledge
and skill (Jones and Wright 1992). Involvement-HR builds around a relatively high
proportion of professionals by structuring jobs to provide maximum challenge,
participation and autonomy.

A growing body of literature has documented the contingency relationship between
HR systems and ﬁrm performance (Delery and Doty 1996). The SHRM literature
consistently shows that
involvement HR practices are associated with positive
performance outcomes and higher ﬁnancial success (Lawler, Mohrman and Ledford
1995; Bae and Lawler 2000; Yu and Egri 2005). Levering and Moskowitz (1993) surveyed
the 100 best companies to work for in the United States, and Lawler et al.’s (1995) survey
on Fortune 1000 companies found that companies that made use of employee involvement
and TQM practices reported signiﬁcantly higher ﬁnancial success. Empirical results from
Singapore, Taiwan and Korea support the notion that high commitment/involvement work
systems or practices have a positive effect on organizational performance (Bae and Lawler
2000; Huang 2000; Khatri 2000). Arthur (1994) and Huselid (1995) found human
resources to be signiﬁcantly related to employee turnover rates. In this study we synthesize
the fruits of
these previous studies, and propose that both inducement-HR and
involvement-HR systems enhance organizational effectiveness, their differential impact
depending on their congruence with the organization’s strategy and culture.

Hypothesis 1:

Both inducement-HR and involvement-HR systems are positively
associated with performance outcomes and negatively associated with
turnover rate. The effect will be stronger for involvement-HR systems.

HR and organizational culture alignment

Organizational culture is one of the most important factors of the internal organizational
environment, and has a great bearing on SHRM (Yeung, Brockbank and Ulrich 1991;
Cabrera and Bonache 1999). Organizational culture refers to the symbols, rituals,
social patterns and shared understanding that govern behavior in the organization.
These beliefs, values, and norms determine how things are done and deﬁne expected
standards of behavior from every individual (Ulrich 1984; Deal and Kennedy 1992).
According to Peters and Waterman (1981), strong cultural norms make an organization
more efﬁcient.

Wallach (1983)

identiﬁed three distinct organizational cultures: bureaucratic;
supportive; and innovative. Bureaucratic cultures are power oriented,
regulated,
procedural and hierarchical. The work is organized and systematic. It is suitable for
well-trained staff but not likely to attract and retain creative and ambitious people.
A bureaucratic culture is not the most conducive to the creation of employee commitment
(Odom, Boxx and Dunn 1990). Supportive cultures are trusting, encouraging, relationship-
oriented and collaborative. They provide an open, harmonious and warm place to work.
People are friendly and helpful. Employees working in a supportive environment are more
satisﬁed and have a greater degree of organizational commitment (Silverthorne 2004).
A supportive culture works very well with the paternalistic style and the explicitly
instrumental nature of inducement-HR systems. An innovative culture is exciting and
dynamic. It provides a creative place to work, and is ﬁlled with challenge and risk.
Innovative cultures encourage competition and develop an entrepreneurial environment.
China is now moving away from a planned economy to a more competitive
market-based system, and its organizational culture is becoming more competitive. In a
dynamic, fast-changing market environment, China’s ﬁrms need a more proactive HR
system to compete successfully with their overseas counterparts. The effect is stronger
and more relevant for matching competitive culture with HR than innovative culture
in the contemporary Chinese context. This is particularly true for involvement-HR
when participation and ﬂexibility are badly needed in a highly competitive market.

Organizational cultures not only facilitate ﬁrm performance, but also strengthen the
impact of HR systems on ﬁrm performance. Companies whose organizational culture
complements their HR systems will perform better. Child (1981) asserts that culture has a
moderating effect on organizations, and notes that culturally-driven preferences inﬂuence
the exercise of choice between alternative practices (p. 318). Managers implement HR
systems based on their assumption and beliefs on the nature of the task and the employees
(Aycan 2005). An empirical study by Silverthorne (2004) found that a supportive
organizational culture appeared to work better in Taiwan than other types of cultures.
A culture that is basically supportive in nature is likely to have the highest level of
employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment, whereas a bureaucratic
organizational culture resulted in the lowest levels of job satisfaction and organizational
commitment. The same results also apply to lower turnover rate. The HR – culture ﬁt is
expected to inﬂuence organizational outcomes. We propose that organizational cultures
interact with HR systems in inﬂuencing ﬁrm performance and turnover.

Hypothesis 2a:

A bureaucratic culture combining both inducement- and involvement-
HR shows no signiﬁcant relationship to performance and turnover.

Hypothesis 2b:

Hypothesis 2c:

A supportive culture combined with inducement-HR is signiﬁcantly
and positively related to performance outcome and negatively
associated with turnover.

A competitive culture coupled with involvement-HR has a signiﬁcant
positive relationship with performance outcomes but is negatively
associated with turnover.

HR and business strategy alignment

Strategic choice theory posits that organizations proactively choose the HRM systems that
best match their strategy (Kochan, McKersie and Cappelli 1984). The strategic perspective
of HRM examines the ﬁt between various HRM practices and the company’s business
strategies (Delery 1998). Previous studies have focused on the linkage between generic
business strategy and HRM types (Schuler 1989; Bird and Beechler 1995). Arthur (1992)
found that cost advantage strategy was strongly related to cost-reduction HRM, and
differentiation was associated with the commitment-maximization HRM system. These
studies show that business strategy is a critical factor in the choice of HRM system.

The strategic ﬁt of HR and business strategy has also been investigated (Schuler and
Jackson 1987; Gunnigle and Moore 1994). In their empirical study, Schuler and Jackson
(1987) analyzed the contingent role of a business strategy and tried to link competitive
strategy to HR systems. Innovative strategies focus on offering something new and
different. The appropriate HR practices for innovative strategies include selecting
highly-skilled, creative individuals, granting more discretion with minimal control, long-
term focus and greater commitment. Thus, innovation strategy is positively associated
with involvement-HR. A quality-enhancing strategy must adapt
to changes and
continuously upgrade product or service quality. HR practices for a quality-enhancing
strategy include high levels of participation, feedback and cooperative teamwork. It is
expected that a quality-enhancing strategy is positively associated with both inducement-
HR and involvement-HR. A cost reduction strategy focuses on controlling expenses and
achieving economies of scale. The corresponding HR practices for a cost reduction
strategy maximize efﬁciency by using narrowly-designed jobs, close monitoring and a
minimal level of training and development. HR can proactively add strategic value by
enhancing the capability of the ﬁrm. This can be evidenced in providing innovative
products and services, reducing costs, and improving quality.

HR systems are effective only when they are appropriately integrated with a speciﬁc
business strategy. Lepak and Snell (1999) examined the interaction of business strategy
and HRM. This interaction is complementary in that the value of one element is increased
by the present of other elements (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1994, p. 973). Based on Dyer
and Holder’s (1988) assertion, ﬁrms are likely to use inducement-HR to compete largely
on price and quality, while involvement-HR relies on an innovation strategy to provide
continually differentiated products and services. The HR-strategy ﬁt is expected to
inﬂuence organizational performance. Thus, we propose that business strategies moderate
the relationship between HR systems and performance outcome.

Hypothesis 3a:

Firms pursuing a quality strategy with both inducement-HR and
involvement-HR systems will be positively associated with perform-
ance outcome and negatively with staff turnover.

Hypothesis 3b:

Firms pursuing an innovation strategy with involvement-HR will be
positively associated with performance outcome and negatively with
staff turnover.

Research method

Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. The survey data were supplemented
with interviews. The interviews provided a deeper understanding of the HR practices
in individual ﬁrms and also acted as a check on the inferences drawn from the survey.
The interviews averaged 1 hour in length. A total of 48 interviews were conducted with
HR experts and managers from Guangzhou, China, to identify a broad range of HR
practices in the Chinese context. Although HR measure scales are available from the
literature, different studies have used different measures of HR practices and there is no
unique set of ‘best’ HR practices. We therefore developed our own measure instead
of translating from the existing scale. Based on the opinion of expert interviews together
with an extensive review from the current literature, a list of HR practices was generated
for the present study. These HR practices are shown in Table 1. Each item was assessed
by a 5-anchored Likert scale, with 1 being the highest and 5 being the lowest.
The questionnaire was constructed in Chinese. These items were pre-tested with a sample
of 110 practicing managers to verify their usefulness.

Questionnaires were sent to the company’s HR Department by e-mail, and follow-up
calls were made in late 2005. From the 600 questionnaires distributed, 451 responses were
received, yielding a response rate of 75.2%. The average length of establishment of the
companies surveyed was 10 years, and the length of operation ranged from 1 to 56 years.
As far as ownership was concerned, 31.5% were state-owned or collectively-owned,
53.9% were Hong Kong and Taiwan ﬁrms in China, and the rest were foreign-invested

companies or joint ventures. The industries covered in the survey included manufacturing
(47%), technology and electronic (29.3%), and a variety of other service industries such as
utilities, ﬁnancial/insurance and property. The average number of employees per ﬁrm was
1,265. The ratio of managerial to operating staff was 11.87%. On average, a company’s
HR department had 10.2 persons. Staff turnover rate for employees was 15%.

Measures

HR practices were assessed by 15 items, which focused on the HR practices such as career
development path, performance standard, salary level, performance-based pay, employ-
ment security, and information sharing. These items were factor analyzed to form two
different HRM systems. The results are shown in Table 1. Consistent with the ﬁndings of
previous studies, the ﬁrst factor was concerned with pay as incentives or inducement-HR.
The second factor focused on how participation, sharing and exchange ﬁtted well with the
involvement-HR system. The results from empirical classiﬁcation essentially correspond
to the theoretical prediction of inducement and involvement HR systems. It is worth noting
that a lower score on this measure indicates relatively intensive use of these HR practices.
These two factors accounted for 48.11% of total variance explained. The alpha coefﬁcients
were .81 for both inducement and involvement-HR types.

Organizational culture was measured by 18 items using a 5-point scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). These items were factor analyzed to form

three cultures, which accounted for 60.63% of the total variance explained (see Table 2).
The alpha coefﬁcients for the bureaucratic, supportive and competitive culture were .82,
.82, and .89 respectively.

Business strategies included cost reduction, innovation and quality enhancement.
Following Schuler and Jackson (1987) and Huang (2001), 10 items were adopted in the
present study. Questionnaire items adopted from existing Western studies were translated
into Chinese and back translated by bilingual research teams to ensure equivalence of
meaning of each item. Respondents were asked to rate each item on a 5-point Likert scale
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). These items were factor
analyzed using principal factor with varimax rotation method, resulting in three factors.
All three factors accounted for 59.02% of the total variance explained (see Table 3).
The alpha coefﬁcients for cost, quality and innovation were .58, .75 and .81 respectively.
The alpha coefﬁcient for the cost-based business strategy seemed low so it was dropped
for further analysis. (Note: Prior research evidence showed that low cost was not a very
good strategy for Chinese ﬁrms (Brouthers and Xu 2002). Emphasis on cost control may
prevent ﬁrms from spending on new product development, technological improvement
and quality control, which in turn may affect ﬁrm performance. Low cost strategy seems
not to play a relevant role.)

Organizational effectiveness is a multidimensional construct (Dyer and Reeves 1995).
Two ﬁrm level performance measures – employee turnover and overall performance
outcomes, were used in the present study. Because not all surveyed organizations are
publicly-listed companies, objective ﬁnancial data are sensitive and not available.

Furthermore, the use of objective ﬁnancial ﬁgures turned out to be not directly comparable
in a study covering a wide variety of different types of organizations. Managers are likely
to provide the best estimate of ﬁrm performance. Overall performance is a composite
measure of productivity, quality of products or services, research and development
capability and market shares. These items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Factor analysis resulted in one single factor accounting
for 53.15% of the variance explained, with an alpha coefﬁcient of 0.76. Staff turnover is
assessed with the annual rate of turnover.

Control variables Firm characteristics, such as size and number of years of operation
are determinants of ﬁrm performance. Larger organizations are more likely to use better-
developed or more sophisticated HR practices. Since ﬁrms with superior resources will be
able to formulate and implement unique and innovative strategies, ﬁrm size and years of
operation are controlled for the prediction of organizational performance. Firm size was
measured by the number of

Results

The descriptive statistics and correlations among variables are shown in Table 4.
Overall outcome was signiﬁcantly correlated with all HR variables, cultural variables and
business strategy variables. Turnover rate was negatively correlated with cultures,
business strategies and outcome variables, but had no signiﬁcant correlation with HR
variables. A low score in HR strategy indicates intensive use of these HR practices.

Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative
effects of HR practices, organizational culture, and business strategy on performance
outcomes. Regression results are given in Table 5. As hypothesized, both inducement and
involvement-HR showed signiﬁcant effects on performance outcomes. The strong impact
of inducement-HR and involvement-HR was reﬂected in both the ß coefﬁcients and DR2.
The results are not fully consistent with hypothesis 1. While both inducement-HR and
involvement-HR showed a direct and signiﬁcant effect on performance outcome, they had
no signiﬁcant effect on reducing turnover. HR systems affect
through
organizational culture and business strategy. Organizational culture as a whole contributed
signiﬁcantly to ﬁrm performance, as indicated by the signiﬁcant changes in R2.
The ß coefﬁcient of competitive culture was highly signiﬁcant, while bureaucratic and
supportive cultures showed no signiﬁcance. Again, business strategy as a whole
contributed signiﬁcantly to ﬁrm performance, as indicated by a signiﬁcant change in R2.
The ß coefﬁcients of quality enhancing and innovation strategy were highly signiﬁcant.
We explored the interaction terms of human resources with business strategies and
corporate cultures. All interaction terms were non-signiﬁcant. The results supported
hypothesis 2a and hypothesis 2c but not hypothesis 2b. Overall F-statistics were highly
signiﬁcant. VIF statistics showed no problem of multicollinearity.

turnover

Staff turnover is an important organizational outcome. Using the same procedure, we
evaluated the relative effects of HR types, organizational culture, and business strategy on
turnover rates. Results are summarized in Table 6. Again, the control variables did not
show signiﬁcant effects on staff turnover. HR systems as a whole added a signiﬁcant
effect, as indicated by the signiﬁcant changes in R2. When these two HR systems were

supportive culture in Model 3. Business strategy as a whole added a signiﬁcant change,
particularly for quality enhancing strategy. Organizations pursing a high quality strategy
reduced their staff turnover rate. The interactions of HR and business strategy as a whole
produced a signiﬁcant impact on turnover. Signiﬁcant interactions were observed for
Inducement-HR*supportive culture, Inducement-HR*quality, Involvement- HR*quality,
and Involvement-HR*competitive. The results offer some support for a contingent
relationship between strategy and HR systems. Hypothesis 3a was supported for turnover
but not for performance outcome. Hypothesis 3b was rejected.

We plotted the interaction effects that were statistically signiﬁcant in Table 6. Figures 2
to 5 display the pattern of signiﬁcant interaction terms. Inducement-HR matching with a
high supportive culture resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower staff turnover, while a low
supportive culture substantially increased staff turnover (Figure 2). The same pattern
was observed in Figure 4 with involvement-HR and competitive strategy. Graphically,
Figures 3 and 5 show that an organization that pursues a high quality strategy signiﬁcantly
reduces staff turnover for both inducement and involvement-HR.

Discussion

This study examines the differential impact of a culture and business strategy alignment
through which two sets or systems of HR practices may affect ﬁrm performance.
The results showed that both inducement-HR and involvement-HR had direct impacts on
enhancing performance outcome but no signiﬁcant effect in reducing the turnover rate.
The results also revealed a different linkage of HR with organizational culture and HR
with business strategy on staff turnover.

For HR-culture ﬁt, organizations with supportive culture tend to foster information
sharing and encourage cooperative team work. This is consistent with the philosophy
of the inducement-HR system that encourages and rewards cooperation and sharing.
If employers offer a high level of inducements, employees may feel obliged to reciprocate
through working harder and would be less likely to quit. Involvement-HR systems that
encourage participation, autonomy, and challenge work well with a competitive culture to
reduce staff turnover. The research ﬁndings do not lend much support to the expected
effect of bureaucratic culture. Organizational culture did not have any interaction effect
with both HR types on performance outcomes.

In HR-strategy link, both involvement-HR and inducement-HR type work well,
particularly with a quality business strategy, in reducing staff turnover rate. A ﬁrm’s
commitment to quality has been found to be important to its performance. Organizations
pursing an innovative strategy demand higher capability from their employees and greater
responsiveness to change in market demands (Yan and Zhang 2003). An HR system

incorporating information sharing and participative problem-solving will facilitate
responsiveness to change and innovation. Both inducement-HR and involvement-HR
matched with a quality business strategy resulted in a lower staff turnover rate. These
ﬁndings imply that organizations may be well advised to focus on a quality-enhancing
strategy.

The results from the present study demonstrate that an HR-culture and HR-business
strategy linkage exists to some extent. Organizational effectiveness is contingent on HR
systems with an appropriate culture and aligning with business strategy. Organizational
culture has a strong inﬂuence on its chosen HR system. HRM contributes most to ﬁrm
performance when it is aligned with business strategy (Gunnigle and Moore 1994).
The ﬁndings reiterate the importance for companies of designing an integrated HR system
consistent with their organizational culture and business strategy.

The conventional thinking is that China’s massive labour force and HR system
supports a business strategy primarily by controlling costs. Contrary to our expectations,
the results of this study demonstrated that the traditional control system (viz. bureaucratic
culture) did not signiﬁcantly beneﬁt ﬁrm performance. Instead, the ﬁrm’s commitment to
quality was shown to be an important determinant of ﬁrm performance. Quality, based on
a more participatory work system, pays off.

Practical implications

The results suggest some insights into the design of HRM systems. It is important to link HR
to a speciﬁc business strategy and to create the culture necessary to execute these business
strategies more effectively to gain competitive advantage. This can be understood best

by identifying distinct, internally consistent sets of HR practices and their relationships to
organizational culture, business strategy, and performance outcomes.

The results of this study demonstrate that HR practices need to be contingent upon the
ﬁrm’s business strategy to be effective (Schuler and Jackson 1987; Delery and Doty 1996).
Organizational culture shapes HR policies that are internally consistent and that suit
the organization’s strategy. Hence, the alignment has major implications for developing an
HRM system which requires the nurturing of organizational culture and ensuring that it is
consistent with the business strategy. The study offers a richer understanding of the ﬁt
between HR, culture, and strategy and organizational effectiveness. The results could be
useful to HR professionals in creating an organizational culture that supports business
strategies to enhance organizational effectiveness. HR directors are expected to play a more
strategic role in their organizations and forge a strategic linkage with business strategy.
Attention should be paid to designing HR systems best able to link the desired culture and
business strategy. Simply focusing on the traditional HR practices, bureaucratic culture,
and low cost may not beneﬁt ﬁrm performance. Obstacles such as an overly bureaucratic
infrastructure and procedures need to be removed. Signiﬁcant improvement will occur
when action is taken to increase supportive cultures for inducement-HR and competitive
culture for involvement-HR. In terms of business strategy, quality enhancement is
most important. Innovation is a risky strategy for organizations that do not emphasize
involvement HR practices.

Last, but not least, the limitations of the study should be acknowledged. The use of the
Likert scale in eliciting opinions may have introduced an element of the subjective. As a
consequence, the results might be artiﬁcially inﬂated. Yet perceptual measures of ﬁrm
performance have been extensively used in survey research (Delaney and Huselid 1996),
especially in China, where systematic reliable data on ﬁrm performance is lacking. In
addition to self-reported perceptual measures of performance outcomes, the potential
problem of common method variance cannot be avoided if all variables are collected from
the same respondent in the same survey (Doty and Glick 1998). Following Podsakoff,
MacKenzie, Lee and Podsakoff (2003), we checked for the presence of common method
bias by conducting Harman’s one factor test in our data. A principal component factor
analysis with an unrotated solution shows that no single factor accounted for a majority of
the covariance in the variables. Common method variance is unlikely to be a serious
problem. The cross-sectional nature of the data makes causality difﬁcult to establish.

Conclusion

To conclude, the involvement-HR system, an HR strategy that has been extensively
studied in recent years, clearly gains support in the present study. Inducement-HR, which

emphasizes efﬁciency and using pay as incentives, works well in China in enhancing ﬁrm
performance. The synergistic impact
is most prominent when these practices are
consistently integrated into a whole system. Each of these HR systems works if it ﬁts
the prevailing business strategy and culture. An HR system should be congruent with the
ﬁrm’s strategy and create an appropriate culture to enhance organizational effectiveness.
