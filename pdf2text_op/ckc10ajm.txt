Abstract
This paper studies the empirical relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial 
performance  in  Korea  using  a  sample  of  1222  firm-years  during  2002–2008. We  measure  corporate  social 
responsibility by both an equal-weighted CSR index and a stakeholder-weighted CSR index suggested by Akpinar 
et al. (2008). Corporate financial performance is measured by return on equity, return on assets, and Tobin’s Q. We 
find a positive and significant relationship between corporate financial performance and the stakeholder-weighted 
CSR index, but not the equal-weighted CSR index. This finding is robust to alternative model specifications and 
several additional tests, providing evidence in support of instrumental stakeholder theory.

1. Introduction

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is now seen as an integral part of corporate strategy. For exam-
ple, KPMG (2008) reports that about three-quarters of Global Fortune 250 companies surveyed dur-
ing  2007–2008  have  a  publicly  communicated  CSR  strategy  that  includes  defined  objectives. 
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2007 survey (The Economist, 2008), nearly 30% of 
surveyed global executives consider CSR as the highest priority issue for their organizations, with a 
further 40% assigning it high priority. Another piece of evidence for the growing importance of CSR

is the proliferation of a new corporate title such as chief sustainability officer or chief responsibility 
officer (‘Companies giving green an office’, The New York Times, July 3, 2007; ‘The old future is 
gone’, Forbes, April 1, 2008),1 or the rapidly spreading Socially Responsible Investment movement 
that aims at combining investors’ financial objectives with their concerns about social, environmen-
tal, and ethical issues (Eurosif, 2003; Lewis and Mackenzi, 2000; SRI Research, 2001–2006).

Examples of CSR activities abound. They range from Intel’s education and development pro-
grams in countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Haiti and Uganda, General Electric’s charitable 
donations and investment in environmentally friendly practices and products (‘Surprising survi-
vors: corporate do-gooders’, Fortune, January 20, 2009), Pfizer’s supply of free name-brand drugs 
to newly unemployed customers (‘Why doing good is good for business’, Fortune, February 2, 
2010), to Starbucks’ offering of health-care benefits and stock to even part-time employees and 
promotion of sound environmental practices by forging partnerships with coffee growers (‘How 
UPS, Starbucks, Disney do good’, Fortune, February 25, 2006). In 2008, the jury of the Internatinal 
Design Excellence Awards also stressed the importance of socially responsible product design; it 
recognized products that promoted sustainability, helped the electoral process, eradicated disease, 
bolstered  village  education  for  the  poor,  etc.  (‘IDEA  Design  Trend:  Social  Responsibility’, 
BusinessWeek, July 17, 2008). Despite the recent financial crunch, many large corporations have 
been sustaining or expanding their CSR budgets. In Australia too, companies such as BHP and Rio 
Tinto have been actively engaging in various community education and development programs in 
countries where their mining activities could have negative effects.2

CSR can be defined as actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of 
the firm and that which is required by law (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Important in this defini-
tion is that CSR activities are on a voluntary basis, going beyond the firm’s legal and contractual 
obligations. As  such  it  involves  a  wide  range  of  activities  such  as  being  employee-friendly, 
environment-friendly,  mindful  of  ethics,  respectful  of  communities  where  the  firms’  plants  are 
located, and even investor-friendly (Bénabou and Tirole, 2010). If CSR activities are beyond the 
firm’s legal obligation and may require some sacrifice in short-term profits, then why do firms 
promote CSR? Is sacrifice of short-term profits compensated by improvement in firms’ long-term 
financial performance? Or are they purely feel-good activities initiated by corporate insiders?

In academic circles, extensive research has been conducted to assess the empirical association 
between  CSR  and  corporate  financial  performance  under  diverse  geographical  contexts.  The 
results of previous studies, however, are largely indeterminate. For example, according to ‘instru-
mental  stakeholder  theory’  (Jones,  1995),  companies  with  superior  social  performance  tend  to 
perform better financially by attracting socially responsible consumers (Bagnoli and Watts, 2003), 
alleviating the threat of regulation (Lev et al., 2008), improving their reputation with consumers 
(Orlitzky et al., 2003), or soothing concerns from activists and non-governmental organizations 
(Baron,  2001).  On  the  other  hand,  other  researchers  argue  that  trying  to  satisfy  the  conflicting 
objectives of different stakeholders might result in inefficient use of resources and eventual dete-
rioration of financial performance, and that the costs incurred from socially responsible actions 
may put the firms at an economic disadvantage (Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullman, 1985). Still others 
argue that it is not possible to determine the relation between CSR and corporate financial perfor-
mance since there are so many intervening variables that are hard to control (Fombrun and Shanley, 
1990). It short, it is a moot question whether CSR contributes to or harms corporate financial per-
formance for all companies or for all types of CSR activities.

This research adds to the empirical literature on the relation between CSR and corporate financial 
performance by providing the first comprehensive evidence from Korea using multi-dimensional CSR 
measures. The business climate in Korea has traditionally put more focus on economic value than on

softer values such as fair distribution of wealth, environmental protection, and community relations, 
etc. Such emphasis upon financial success still lingers on, particularly when the pursuit of profit and 
social goals tend to collide with each other. The two recent cases of a west coast oil spill and large-scale 
money  laundering  committed  by  Korea’s  leading  conglomerates  provide  telling  evidence  in  this 
regard.3 These incidents have provided momentum for a heated debate about CSR in public arena, led 
to a rise in public outcry for changing the old-fashioned way of doing business, and increased concern 
for  environment  and  transparency  in  corporate  governance.  Moreover,  with  its  first  sustainability 
report published in 2003, CSR movements emerged as a major social agenda in Korea. In this sense, 
the Korean corporate environment provides a pertinent test case for examining the empirical relation-
ship between corporate financial prosperity and the extent of corporate social initiatives.

Despite the growing importance of CSR in Korea, existing Korean studies are focused only on 
corporate environmental performance (Choi et al., 2008; Choi and Kwak, 2010, among others). 
Empirical research examining the association between multi-dimensional CSR activities and cor-
porate financial performance in Korea does not exist, to our knowledge. As such, this study is the 
first that provides Korean evidence on the relationship between multi-dimensional CSR and corpo-
rate financial performance. Specifically, we measure CSR performance by the Korea Economic 
Justice Institute (KEJI) index developed by the Citizens’ Coalition for Economic Justice (CCEJ). 
The CCEJ is one of Korea’s leading NGOs, and it established the KEJI for the purpose of evaluat-
ing the moral management and social responsibility of Korea’s leading corporations.4 The KEJI 
index is the first comprehensive, multi-dimensional CSR index developed in Korea, and is compa-
rable to the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP) index in the US, the Corporate Responsibility 
Index in Australia, and the Asahi Foundation index of Japan.

Our main findings can be summarized as follows. There is a positive and significant relation 
between CSR and corporate financial performance when CSR is measured by a stakeholder-weighted 
index  that  takes  into  account  the  degree  with  which  specific  stakeholder  groups  are  prioritized. 
When CSR is measured by an equal-weighted index, the relation is insignificant. These results hold 
for all three financial performance variables that we use, i.e. return on equity (ROE), return on assets 
(ROA) and Tobin’s Q. The positive association between the stakeholder-weighted CSR index and 
corporate financial performance is robust to alternative model specifications and several additional 
tests, further strengthening the case for using the stakeholder-weighted metric in measuring CSR. In 
an additional analysis of the bi-directional relationship between CSR and corporate financial perfor-
mance after controlling for potential endogeneity, we also find that high levels of corporate financial 
performance have a positive impact on the stakeholder-weighted CSR index. Thus we conclude that, 
on average, Korean firms can do well by doing good on the one hand, and firms that do well can 
spend money for good causes on the other, demonstrating the existence of a virtuous cycle.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature; 
Section 3 describes research design, while Section 4 reports the empirical findings. Section 5 con-
cludes the paper with some discussions.

2. Related literature
The empirical literature examining the relation between CSR and corporate financial performance 
is extensive. As discussed previously, however, the results are generally mixed, which could be 
attributed to the various ways corporate financial performance and CSR have been operationally 
defined (Carroll, 1979; Orlitzky et al., 2003), to the lack of appropriate statistical controls (Margolis 
and Walsh, 2003; Wood and Jones, 1995), or to the ‘stakeholder misalignment’ problem (Akpinar 
et al., 2008; Wood and Jones, 1995).

Typically used firm performance variables are accounting-based measures such as ROE and 
ROA,  and  market-based  measures  such  as Tobin’s  Q.  Regarding  corporate  social  performance, 
existing studies have used a diversity of measures. Earlier studies relied on various reputational 
indices, such as Moskowitz’s (1972, 1975) tripartite ratings of ‘outstanding’, ‘honorable mention’, 
and ‘worst’ companies (Cochran and Wood 1984; Sturdivant and Ginter 1997), or the Fortune’s 
ratings of a corporation’s responsibility to the community and environment (Conine and Madden 
1987; Fombrun and Shanley 1990; McGuire et al. 1998). Another widely used index is the measure 
provided by the CEP based on social audits. Various studies have used the CEP social audit ranking 
of companies’ pollution records (Blackburn et al., 1994; Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Fogler and 
Nutt 1975; Spicer 1978). The KLD index is one of the most recent measures designed to explicitly 
evaluate multiple dimensions of a company’s social and financial performance.5 Many recent stud-
ies rely on the KLD index to measure CSR in investigating the relation between CSR and corporate 
financial performance (Akpinar et al., 2008; Berman et al., 1999; McWilliams et al., 2006; Orlitzky 
et al., 2003; Waddock and Graves, 1997).

Table 1 provides a summary of selected empirical studies where the second column indicates 
the statistical relation between CSR and corporate financial performance. As shown in the table, 
some studies report a positive relationship while others report a mixed or negative relationship. In

regards to the mixed evidence, McWilliams and Siegel (2000) stress the importance of including 
other variables that are acknowledged to be important determinants of corporate financial perfor-
mance. For example, they show that, once R&D investment is included in the equation, the positive 
relation between CSR and corporate financial performance is no longer significant.

The so-called ‘stakeholder misalignment’ problem suggested by Wood and Jones (1995) is that 
of relating stakeholder-specific variables to a set of aggregated stakeholder variables, ignoring many 
differences between different stakeholder groups. They argue that the research on CSR should take 
into account the fact that a company should weigh which sub-dimensions of social performance are 
perceived to be important by its stakeholders. To circumvent the stakeholder misalignment prob-
lem, Lev et al. (2008) classify firms into two groups based on the degree of sensitivity to consumer 
perceptions. The first group consists of firms belonging to industries where sensitivity to consumer 
perception is high, such as consumer goods and finance industries, and the second group has firms 
operating in industries where sensitivity to consumer perception is low. They empirically show that 
firms producing goods and services purchased by individual consumers are more likely to enhance 
their revenue by having a reputation as a good corporate citizen than firms that produce goods and 
services for industrial or government use. Akpinar et al. (2008) measure CSR by a stakeholder-
weighted CSR index which aggregates the index scores for CSR sub-dimensions after taking into 
account stakeholder conflicts and varying importance of different CSR sub-dimensions in different 
industries.  They  find  a  significantly  positive  association  between  CSR  and  corporate  financial 
performance when the stakeholder-weighted CSR index is used to measure CSR. Our paper is in 
the same vein as Akpinar et al. (2008) in that we develop a stakeholder-weighted CSR index.

With a steady increase in the number and kind of stakeholder groups interested in broader cor-
porate social performance (Shapiro, 1992), a number of studies have elaborated on or empirically 
tested the instrumental stakeholder theory (Alexander and Buchholz, 1978; Berman et al., 1999; 
Bowman and Haire, 1975; Jones, 1995; Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Waddock and Graves, 1997). 
Graves and Waddock (1994) and Teoh and Shiu (1990) argue that institutional investors are favor-
ably inclined toward companies with better social performance when other factors are held con-
stant and independent information on social performance is available. Bowman and Haire (1975) 
contend that other stakeholders in addition to stockholders and bondholders may regard CSR as an 
indication  of  management  skill. Alexander  and  Buchholz  (1978)  also  suggest  that  CSR  makes 
firms  an  attractive  investment  target,  since  investors  evaluate  socially  aware  and  concerned 
management as possessing the requisite skill to run a superior company. Similarly, Spicer (1978) 
finds a positive association between stock price and corporate social performance, and suggests 
that the latter provides information about management competence. Along the same line, Waddock 
and Graves (1997) report a positive relation between CSR and the quality of management, where 
the latter is measured by the Fortune reputation survey ranking.

Among related Korean research, Choi et al. (2008) study the relation between corporate environ-
mental disclosure and financial performance over the 7-year period following the financial crisis of 
1997. They find no significant relationship between the quality of disclosure and economic perfor-
mance, while corporate size and industry profile are shown to be the most significant factors behind 
corporate environmental disclosure. More recently, Choi and Kwak (2010) studied the relationship 
between the level of corporate environmental disclosure and environmental performance using a 
sample of 180 cases of stand-alone environmental reports and/or environmental information disclosed 
on corporate websites. They document a positive association between corporate environmental 
performance  and  the  level  of  discretionary  environmental  disclosure. As  mentioned  previously, 
however, we are not aware of any Korean studies that use a comprehensive, multi-dimensional CSR 
measure in investigating the relation between CSR and corporate financial performance.

CONTROL

where  CFP  denotes  corporate  financial  performance,  CSRindex  denotes  the  corporate  social 
responsibility index, CONTROL stands for various control variables, subscripts index firm (i) and 
time (t), and ε
 is an i.i.d. error term. Equation (1) is designed to investigate the relation between 
it
corporate financial performance and CSR index on a cross-sectional basis, where the former is 
measured using firm-level performance measures such as accounting- and/or market-based indica-
tors. However, cross-sectional regression models are not likely to control other variables that are 
acknowledged to be major determinants of corporate financial performance over a period of time.
We thus employ Carhart’s (1997) four-factor market model in addition to Equation (1) in order 
to see whether market-based financial performance measured by stock returns incorporates corpo-
rate social performance as well. As is well known, Carhart’s four-factor model extends Fama and 
French’s (1993) three-factor model by adding the momentum factor suggested by Jegadeesh and 
Titman (1993): it controls for the impact of market risk, the size factor, the book-to-market factor, 
and the momentum factor on stock returns. Numerous studies have employed Fama–French or 
Carhart or other variants of multi-factor models to test the financial market performance based on 
potential  additional  factors  such  as  information  asymmetry  stemming  from  R&D  (Aboody  and 
Lev,  2000),  corporate  governance  (Bauer  et  al.,  2004),  accruals  quality  (Francis  et  al.,  2005), 
socially responsible investing (Kempf and Osthoff, 2007), etc.

Using  the  four-factor  model,  we  analyze  whether  investors  can  obtain  abnormal  returns  by 
employing socially responsible screens, i.e. holding a long position in the good CSR portfolio and 
a short position in the bad CSR portfolio.6 To this end, we rank firms according to their CSR index 
order and construct two portfolios by including firms from the first decile in the top portfolio and 
those from the tenth decile in the bottom portfolio. We then calculate the difference in monthly 
returns between the top and bottom portfolios, which shows a return on the hedge portfolio that can 
be earned by taking a long position in the most socially responsible firms and a short position in 
the least socially responsible counterparts. Therefore, the dependent variable in our model is the 
difference between monthly portfolio returns of high CSR and low CSR firms over the sample 
period. The independent variables are the four factors of market return, size, book-to-market, and 
momentum. The market risk factor is the monthly excess return on the market portfolio over the 
risk-free rate. The size factor is the monthly return on the size factor portfolio. The book-to-market 
factor is the monthly return on the book-to-price factor-mimicking portfolio based on the book-to-
market ratio. The momentum factor is the monthly return on a momentum factor portfolio.7

To examine the extent to which investors can gain by taking the aforementioned long–short 
strategy based on the CSR index, we estimate the intercept term of the four-factor market model, 
known as the Carhart’s alpha. The alpha coefficient represents the excess return an investor could 
have earned by pursuing the CSR-based investment strategy, after controlling for the four factors 
included in the model. Our second model to be estimated is thus as follows:

 in Equation (2) represents

the abnormal return on a zero-investment strategy that buys the top portfolio and sells short the 
bottom portfolio. If it is positive and significant, then we can say that there is a difference in market 
performance of top and bottom portfolios even after removing the influence from the four factors. 
Such a difference can be due to the difference in CSR since our hedge portfolios are based on firms’ 
CSR index scores.

3.2 Variable description
3.2.1 Corporate financial performance.  For corporate financial performance, we follow the litera-
ture and use both accounting-based and market-based financial performance measures. As account-
ing-based performance measures, we use ROA = earning before interest and tax (EBIT) / total 
asset, and ROE = EBIT / owner’s capital. Our market-based performance measure is Tobin’s Q 
following Chung and Pruitt’s (1994) approximation.8 Tobin’s Q = (market value of common stock 
+ market value of preferred stock + short-term liabilities – short-term assets + book value of long-
term debt) / book value of total assets. This approximation assumes that the replacement cost of a 
firm’s plant, property, and equipment and inventories is equal to their book value. It also assumes 
that market and book values of short-term debt are identical, while long-term debt is measured by 
its book value as an approximation of its market value.

3.2.2 Corporate social responsibility.  To measure corporate social performance by Korean firms, we 
use two proxies based on the KEJI index developed by the CCEJ. The KEJI index, introduced in 
1991, is the first comprehensive evaluation scheme for corporate business ethics and social respon-
sibility  developed  and  implemented  in  Korea.9  Each  year,  the  KEJI  selects  annual  Economic 
Justice Award winners. The KEJI’s procedure to select award winners consists of both quantitative 
and qualitative evaluation. Quantitative evaluation is applied to Korean companies listed on the 
Korea Exchange (KRX) on the basis of annual reports, news reports, and other information avail-
able from governmental authorities such as the National Tax Service, the Fair Trade Commission, 
and the KRX, excluding those firms under serious financial trouble.10 Qualitative evaluation is 
subsequently conducted by sending questionnaires to the overall top 10% firms and top 20% firms 
for each of the Korean SIC-based industry based on their KEJI index scores. The main purpose of 
qualitative evaluation is to collect non-public information to determine final award winners. The 
KEJI annually discloses the scores of top 200 companies in its brochure, with the names of three 
award winners.

The KEJI index is comparable to the CEP index in the US, the Corporate Responsibility Index 
in Australia, the Asahi Foundation index of Japan, and several other corporate ethics indices of 
European countries. One of the distinctive features of the KEJI index is that it is a product of an 
independent  rating  service  that  focuses  on  the  evaluation  of  multidimensional  corporate  social 
performance. It gives a score on seven individual categories of CSR: soundness, fairness, contribu-
tion to society, consumer protection, environmental protection, employee satisfaction, and contri-
bution to economy.11 We develop two proxies based on the KEJI index. As explained in footnote 7, 
the original KEJI index assigns different maximum scores to different individual categories, which 
is rather arbitrary. Thus we converted original scores for individual categories to scores that take 


298   

Australian Journal of Management 35(3)

the maximum value of 100. For example, a score of 20 for the soundness category is converted to 
20*(100/25) = 80 since the maximum score for the soundness category is 25. This way, the maxi-
mum total score becomes 700.

The first proxy is defined as the simple sum of scores for seven categories of the KEJI index:

 

Equal-weighted CSR index (EW)it =

7

∑ xikt

=
k 1

 

(3)

ikt

where x
 is the score for firm i, the KEJI category k for year t, which takes the maximum value of 
100 as described above. This approach has an obvious drawback in that it assumes all KEJI catego-
ries are equally important to all stakeholders. As discussed in the instrumental stakeholder theory, 
firms with different interests may need to attend to different stakeholders differently (Wood and 
Jones, 1995). Depending on the specific areas of social responsibility considered to be important 
by major stakeholders, firms may exert different levels of effort to different categories of social 
responsibility, hence are likely to receive different scores for different CSR categories. Our first 
proxy for CSR suffers from the lack of a weighting scheme for the different categories of CSR. We 
thus introduce weighted measures of CSR, as proposed by Akpinar et al. (2008).

Akpinar et al. (2008) argue that the stakeholder-weighted CSR index is a new CSR measure that 
reflects the relative importance of each stakeholder group based on the industry to which individual 
firms belong. In order to operationalize the second proxy for CSR, we first classify our sample firms 
into 18 industries according to the Korean Standard Industry Classification codes. After this, the 
KEJI index score for each of the seven categories is summed up to obtain an aggregate score of social 
performance for that particular industry-year. Then individual sums for each of the seven categories 
are divided by this overall sum to compute the weights for each of the seven categories for every 
industry-year. After finding the weights for every industry-year, we multiply the raw KEJI index 
scores with associated weights to obtain the stakeholder-weighted CSR index for every firm-year:

the definition, the weight measures how an industry scores in a particular KEJI category relative to 
the average performance of that industry in overall CSR. To the extent that different industries 
perform  better  in  different  KEJI  categories,  possibly  because  their  CSR  activities  are  directed 
towards the interests of their primary stakeholders, one can interpret these weights as reflecting 
varying stakeholder interests. Indeed, our data lend support to this interpretation: environmental 
protection is given the highest weight in the chemical and hard-coal industry, employee satisfaction 
in the metal industry, and consumer protection in the retail trade industry.12

3.2.3 Control variables.  We use several control variables that are consistently shown to be related 
to corporate financial performance. These control variables can be broadly broken down into two 
groups: firm characteristics and management preferences. The firm characteristics group includes 


Choi et al. 

299

size (Arlow and Gannon, 1982; Shin and Stulz, 1998), risk (McWilliams and Siegel, 2000) and 
sales growth (De, 1992). To control for the past corporate performance, we also lag sales growth 

by 1 year and include it as an additional control. We take logarithm of total assets to measure firm 

size and define firm risk using long-term debt divided by total asset. We include sales growth for 
year t using log of sales in year t divided by sales of year t–1. We also include lagged sales growth 
for year t, which is measured by sales of year t–1 divided by sales of year t–2. Management prefer-
ence  variables  include  R&D  expenditure  standardized  by  total  assets  (McWilliams  and  Siegel, 
2000). Lastly, we also control for industry and year effects by including eight industry- and two 
year-dummy variables to distinguish nine industries and 3 years under coverage in this study. Thus 
our control variables are SIZE = Log (total asset), RISK = Long-term debt / total asset, DSales
 = 
t
log (Sales for year t / Sales for year t–1), DSales
 = log (Sales for year t–1 / Sales for year t–2), and

mimicking portfolios designed to capture size, book-to-market, and momentum effects, respec-
tively. The factor portfolios are specifically constructed following the method of Fama and French 
(1993) and Carhart (1997). The SMB portfolio is based on the firm’s market capitalization at the 
end of January from 2002–2007. The companies with the lowest 10% of market capitalization are 
defined as ‘small’, while the top 10% of firms are defined as ‘big’. The return on the portfolio of 
‘big’ companies is subtracted from the return on the ‘small’ portfolio.13 The HML factor-mimicking 
portfolio is constructed in a similar way: the 10% of companies with the highest book-to-market 
are included in the ‘value portfolio’ while the bottom 10% are defined as ‘growth portfolio’, and 
the return on the growth portfolio is subtracted from the return on the value portfolio. To construct 

the momentum portfolio, the 10% of firms with the highest 11-month returns lagged by 1 month 

are classified as ‘winners’. The bottom 10% are classified as ‘losers’. Each month, the return on the 
losers’ portfolio is subtracted from the return on the winners’ portfolio.

4. Empirical results

4.1 Data and descriptive statistics
Our sample is drawn from companies listed on the KRX14 for which the KEJI index is available. 
While the selection of our sample is inevitably limited to those firms that appear on the KEJI index, 
hence subject to possible selection bias, we are not aware of any alternative reliable measures of 
CSR in Korea comparable to the KEJI index in its coverage, and measurement validity. For our 
sample firms, financial data were retrieved from the TS-2000 database.15 Up to 2001, the KEJI 
index had only six categories, and from 2002 the index was expanded to include an additional 
category. In order to maintain consistency of our data, we have used the seven-category KEJI index 
scores from 2002. Thus our sample period covers 7 years from 2002–2008 and the final sample 
includes 1222 firm-years from both manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries.

We classified sample firms into 18 industries using the Korean Standard Industry Classification 
codes. The distribution of sample firms based on their industry classification is shown in Table 
2, while the weights for each of the seven KEJI categories for each industry are shown in Table 
3. These weights are used to calculate the stakeholder-weighted CSR index on an annual basis.

Descriptive statistics for the variables used in the estimation are summarized in Table 4. The stan-
dard deviations of equal weight (EW) and stakeholder weight (SW) are relatively small, suggesting 
that our sample consists of relatively homogeneous group of firms in their perceived CSR activities.

4.2 Correlation and analysis of variance
As discussed previously, good management theory or instrumental stakeholder theory predict a posi-
tive relation between corporate social performance and financial performance. Table 5 reports Pearson 
correlation  coefficients  and  provides  some  preliminary  evidence  in  support  of  this.  While  EW  is 
shown to be positively correlated with ROA only, SW is positively correlated with all three perfor-
mance measures. SIZE is positively correlated with both EW and SW, which is consistent with a 
commonly shared view that, as firm size increases, corporate responsibility tends to increase as well.
Using a series of one-way ANOVA tests, Table 6 examines the mean differences among three 
different groups of CSR for corporate financial performance. In panel A, we used the equal-weighted 
CSR  index  to  rank  the  sample  firms,  while  in  panel  B,  we  used  the  stakeholder-weighted  CSR

index. In both panels, corporate financial performance for firms with higher CSR index is shown to 
be higher than those with lower CSR index. This is true for all three financial performance variables 
and the difference among the three groups of firms is statistically significant. In sum, both Tables 5 
and 6 seem to suggest a positive relation between CSR and corporate financial performance. We 
examine this more rigorously below.

4.3 Cross-sectional regression analysis
This section reports the results from the cross-sectional regression analysis, specified in Equation 
(1). The dependent variable is corporate financial performance, measured by ROA, ROE, or Tobin’s 
Q. In Table 7, Model 1 reports the results when the equal-weighted CSR index (EW) and five con-
trol variables are used as independent variables, while Model 2 reports the results when the stake-
holder-weighted CSR index (SW) is used along with the same set of control variables. Both models 
used dummy variables to control for industry- and year-effects, but for brevity the results are not 
shown in the table. Both models are shown to have significant explanatory power at the conven-
tional level. However, the coefficient to EW is not significant in Model 1 regardless of how corpo-
rate financial performance is measured. On the other hand, Model 2 shows that the coefficient to 
SW is positive and statistically significant for all three financial performance variables. This implies 
that, when CSR is measured while taking into account firm-specific stakeholders’ interests, there is 
a positive association between corporate financial performance and CSR. We do note, however, that 
our results should not be interpreted to render direct support to good management theory or instru-
mental stakeholder theory. While both theories suggest a positive link from CSR to corporate finan-
cial performance, our results do not imply causality in either direction, for which we need longer 
and more comprehensive time-series data. We discuss this issue in Section 4.5.

4.4 Estimation of the four-factor model
Table 8 reports the estimation results from Carhart’s (1997) four-factor model, specified in Equation 
(2). As discussed previously, the dependent variable in this regression is the difference in monthly 
returns between top and bottom portfolios, ranked based on their KEJI indices, and independent

 is not significantly different from zero (t = 0.79) when the sample firms 
are ranked based on the equal-weighted CSR index, but it is positive and significant (t = 3.98) 
when the stakeholder-weighted CSR index is used to rank the sample firms. We can interpret the 
latter result to imply that there is a 31.1 basis point difference in monthly returns between the two 
portfolios that can be explained by the firms’ corporate social performance. This is in addition to 
the difference that can be explained by Carhart’s four factors. Once again, our result indicates a

positive association between CSR and corporate financial performance when firms prioritize their 
CSR activities based on their stakeholder interests.

4.5 Additional analyses
As discussed previously, the various theories in the management literature predict different links 
between corporate social performance and financial performance. On the one hand, good manage-
ment theory or instrumental stakeholder theory suggest a positive link from corporate social per-
formance to financial performance. According to slack resources theory (Ullmann, 1985; Waddock 
and Graves 1997), however, the link is reversed: financially healthy firms can afford to engage in 
more CSR activities, which in turn are likely to improve financial performance further, particularly 
when the CSR activities are properly directed toward stakeholder preferences.

As an additional test, we address such an endogeneity issue by estimating the following simul-
taneous equation system after controlling for endogeneity by employing two-stage least squares 
(2SLS) regression analysis:

The results are presented in Table 9.16 As can be seen in panel B of the table, only the estimated 
coefficients for stakeholder-weighted CSR are positive and statistically significant, which is con-
sistent with previous results. Panel A also shows that high levels of financial performance provide 
slack resources necessary to engage in CSR with which stakeholders are prioritized. In a nutshell, 
Table 9 shows that CSR activities which take stakeholders’ priority into account can have a posi-
tive impact upon corporate financial performance, which in turn feeds back to stakeholder-oriented 
CSR activities. These results support Waddock and Graves’ (1997) argument in favor of a ‘virtuous 
cycle’ between CSR and corporate financial performance.

To address any statistical causation between CSR and corporate financial performance, we also 
conduct Granger causality tests. Since the selection of firms on the KEJI index varies year to year, 
we could identify only 40 firms in our sample that had seven consecutive years of time-series data 
on the KEJI index. Partial results from Granger causality tests for this sub-sample are presented in 
Table 10, where financial performance is measured by Tobin’s Q. Panels A and B show that causal-
ity runs in neither direction when CSR is measured by EW while Panels C and D suggest bilateral 
causality when CSR is measured by SW. Once more, these results provide support for the virtuous 
cycle between CSR and corporate financial performance.17

Finally, we conducted further analyses to check the robustness of our findings. First, for each CSR 
index presented in Table 6, we replicated the difference test across the four CSR groups using non-
parametric Kruskal–Wallis test. The results from this test are qualitatively similar, and with compa-
rable level of significance, to those reported in the parametric ANOVA-test.18 Second, we replicated

our regressions by calculating EW and SW for each of the seven CSR categories in the KEJI index 
and used them as the CSR variable. Again the results are similar in that there is a positive and signifi-
cant association between corporate financial performance and only the stakeholder-weighted CSR 
index, except for the two categories of contribution to society and consumer protection. Partial results 
of this analysis are provided in Table 11, where financial performance is measure by Tobin’s Q.

5. Conclusion

The existing studies on the relation between CSR and corporate financial performance provide 
mixed results. This study was motivated by the lack of consistent evidence on the one hand and the 
relative paucity of research in the Korean context on the other. We have investigated the relation 


Choi et al. 

307

between CSR and corporate financial performance using a sample of Korean firms where CSR is 
measured by the KEJI index, the first comprehensive, multi-dimensional CSR measure in Korea. 
The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, our research design improves upon many 
existing studies in several ways by (i) circumventing the stakeholder misalignment problem with 
use of the stakeholder-weighted CSR index; (ii) employing Carhart’s (1997) four-factor model to 
control for other variables that are known to be important determinants of corporate financial per-
formance; (iii) conducting additional analysis of bi-directional relation between CSR and corpo-
rate financial performance after controlling for potential endogeneity; and (iv) carrying out Granger 
causality tests for CSR and corporate financial performance. Second, our study provides the first 
comprehensive evidence from Korea on the relation between multi-dimensional CSR and corpo-
rate financial performance.

Our main finding is that there is a positive and significant association between corporate finan-
cial  performance  and  the  stakeholder-weighted  CSR  measure,  but  not  the  equal-weighted  CSR 
measure. The positive association is robust to alternative model specifications and several addi-
tional tests, further strengthening the case for using the stakeholder-weighted metric in measuring 
CSR.  These  results  suggest  that  it  is  important  for  a  firm  to  realize  which  aspect  of  its  social 
responsibility is more important to its primary stakeholders, and that a firm’s social initiatives, 
when properly directed, tend to improve its bottom line in Korea.

We conclude the paper with discussions on some limitations of this study that need to be addressed 
in future studies. First, we have not clearly addressed the concern for a possible bias in sample selection. 
Our sample is drawn from a population of firms selected by the CCEJ for construction of its KEJI 
index. The selected firms tend to be large, with superior position in terms of financial performance 
and CSR. However, this limitation is inevitable since the KEJI index is the only reliable multi-
dimensional CSR measure available in Korea. Second, while the KEJI index is considered to be 
the most reliable measure of CSR currently available in Korea, it has room for further improvement 
in the way firms are selected and in the process whereby qualitative and quantitative assessments 
determine the final score. Finally, the 7-year period this study covers may not be long enough to 
generalize the results. It would be necessary to exercise caution when deriving inference from the 
results of this study. In future research, we expect to extend the coverage of sample firms both by 
using augmented datasets on CSR and by experimenting with alternative model specifications.

Notes
  1  Chief sustainability officer, usually with the rank of vice president or higher, is in charge of overall CSR 
programs in the corporation. As of 2005, almost all of the 150 largest companies in the world had a chief 
sustainability officer (Willard, 2005).

  2  Rio Tinto made a total community contribution of $134 million in 2008, the largest component being 
in various community education programs (http://www.riotinto.com/ourapproach/17215_communities_ 
17356.asp).

  3  On  7  December  2007,  a  large-scale  oil-spill  accident  occurred  off  the  coast  of Tae-an,  South  Korea, 
caused by the reckless sailing of a tugboat owned by one of the leading Korean shipbuilders amidst 
hostile weather conditions. The crude oil leakage of about 12,000 tons was the largest in Korea, resulting 
in the devastation of regional economy with the estimated total damage of $519 million, not to mention 
the colossal damage to the ecosystem. The company involved paid only $5 million to the affected com-
munity,  and  the  compensation  case  is  still  unresolved  as  of  early  2010.  In  another  case  involving  a

massive earnings manipulation amounting to some $1.2 billion, committed by another leading Korean 
conglomerate in 2003, the CEO and other responsible executives were sentenced to probation, on the 
ground that the accounting fraud was intended to help alleviate the financial difficulties incumbent upon 
the whole group.

  4  More details on the CCEJ and KEJI can be found at http://www.ccej.or.kr/English/
  5  The KLD index, developed by Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini, rates companies based on five criteria, 
along a scale of -2 to +2, depending upon their social performance, and provides data on financial perfor-
mance of socially screened portfolios. For details, see http://www.kld.com/indexes/index.html

  6  There are two ways one can estimate the multi-factor models such as Fama–French or Carhart. The first 
approach  includes  the  additional  factor  as  an  additional  independent  variable  by  forming  a  factor-
mimicking portfolio on the basis of the potential factor (Francis et al., 2005). The second approach incor-
porates the additional factor in the dependent variable by calculating the difference between portfolio 
returns constructed on the basis of the potential factor (Aboody and Lev, 2000; Bauer et al., 2003; Kempf 
and Osthoff , 2007). We follow the second approach.

  7  The historical excess return data on the four factors are available from the Kenneth French Data Library 
for the US and several other international markets. Since the Korean stock market data are not directly 
available from this library, however, we calculate the four factors by combining portfolios composed by 
stocks rank-ordered according to each of the factors with market data available from the Korean Stock 
Exchange. The details are provided in Section 3.2.4.

  8  We use Chung and Pruitt’s approximation simply because the market value of debt is not available from 
accounting information. The information required to calculate Chung and Pruitt’s approximation is read-
ily  obtainable  from  the  firm’s  financial  report.  Chung  and  Pruitt  showed  that  their  approximation  of 
Tobin’s Q has a high correlation with that based on Lindenberg and Ross (1981). Moreover a great major-
ity of academic researchers and financial practitioners nowadays use Chung and Pruitt’s approximation.
  9  The index was subsequently modified and refined in 1993 based on wide consultation with the represen-
tatives from academia, journalists, governmental authorities, labor union, NGOs, business community, 
and general public.

10  Criteria for exclusion include the following: three consecutive years of net losses, less than 1.0 debt-to-
equity ratio, lower than 1.0 times-interest-rate (interest expense plus EBIT divided by EBIT), merger 
target, and newly listed companies whose financial data are unavailable.

11  More  specifically,  the  soundness  category  comprises  stockholder  composition,  investment,  financing, 
and is assigned a maximum score of 25. The fairness category consists of fair trade, economic concentra-
tion, transparency, supplier relationship, and is assigned a maximum score of 15. The contribution to 
society  category  considers  care  for  minority  groups,  corporate  donation,  and  is  assigned  a  maximum 
score of 10. The consumer protection category comprises protection of consumer sovereignty, product 
quality  and  promotion  with  a  maximum  score  of  10.  The  environmental  protection  category  covers 
environmental  improvement  efforts,  environmental  friendliness,  and  compliance  with  environmental 
regulation with a maximum score of 15. The employee satisfaction category consists of workplace safety, 
human resource investment, wage and welfare, labor-management relationship, and gender equality with 
a maximum score of 15. The contribution to economy category relates to R&D efforts, operating per-
formance, and contribution to economy through tax payment, productivity growth and export, for which 
a maximum score of 10 is given. More details on the KEJI index and its scoring system are available from 
the authors.

12  An alternative interpretation of these weights is the relative competitive position of each industry on their 
CSR activities. Our interpretation is not inconsistent with this interpretation if we accept the assumption, 
which we believe is innocuous, that an industry’s CSR activities are geared towards the interests of its 
primary stakeholders. This assumption is also supported by McWilliams et al. (2006).

13  This procedure yields a series of 12*7 = 84 monthly factor returns since the sample period covers 2002–
2007 in our analyses. The factor-mimicking portfolios are rebalanced as of the end of January. The same 
technique is applied to construct other factor-mimicking portfolios. We also replicated the procedure by 
reconstructing portfolios on a monthly basis, which resulted in qualitatively similar results.

14  The Korea Exchange (KRX) was created through the integration of the three existing Korean spot & 
futures exchanges (Korea Stock Exchange, Korea Futures Exchange and KOSDAQ) under the Korea 
Stock & Futures Exchange Act. As of 31 December 2007, the KRX had 1757 listed companies with a 
combined market capitalization of $1.1 trillion. For more details, see http://www.krx.co.kr.

15  TS-2000 stands for Business Information Total Solution 2000, which is a Korean version of CRSP data-
base, developed by Korea Listed Companies Association. It provides financial information on KRX- and 
KOSDAQ-listed companies and industrial data for statistics and analysis.

16  We also conducted Hausman’s test to detect the presence of any endogenous relation between CSR and 
corporate financial performance. Untabulated results of Hausman’s test indicate that there is endogeneity 
between CSR and corporate financial performance. This result suggests that it is necessary to employ the 
simultaneous equations model as in (5).

17  We also replicated the analysis using ROA and ROE and arrived at qualitatively similar results, which are 

available from the authors.

18  The results are not reported, but available from the authors.
