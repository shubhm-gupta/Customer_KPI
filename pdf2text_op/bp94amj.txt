 REMOVING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

 HALO FROM FORTUNE'S "MOST

 ADMIRED" COMPANIES

 BRAD BROWN

 Fortune's annual ratings of America's largest corporations are shown
 to be heavily influenced by previous financial results, thus creating a
 halo that must be removed before these qualitative reputational mea-
 sures can be used appropriately in other research. This article presents
 a method for removing that performance halo and demonstrates the
 method's validity.

 Many interesting organizational research questions are difficult to an-
 swer because there are no readily available, direct measures of the constructs
 of interest. For example, researchers may want to identify companies that are
 innovative, ethical, well managed, or environmentally responsible. Without
 direct measures, they are forced to develop secondary proxies that perhaps
 capture only a portion of the constructs of interest. Although the use of proxy
 variables is reasonable given the inability to directly study important issues,
 researchers must constantly be mindful that the measures being analyzed are
 proxies, not the actual constructs of interest.

 Large-scale surveys that appear to measure organizational constructs
 directly are sometimes reported in the popular press. Our research focuses
 on the corporate attributes reported annually in Fortune's "most admired
 corporations" issue (e.g., Ballen, 1992). Researchers must be cautious when
 using these large-scale surveys because the characteristics of survey respon-
 dents, data-gathering methods, and survey questions may introduce mea-
 surement error. If this error is pervasive, coloring many or all of the indi-
 vidual attribute ratings of an object-the objects in our study are the com-
 panies in the Fortune surveys-a halo is said to exist. Before these large-
 scale surveys can be used in academic research, this halo must be removed.
 In this article, we examine the financial performance halo derived from the

 Fortune most admired companies survey and present a statistical method
 designed to remove a significant portion of that halo. We demonstrate the
 validity of our method by comparing four of our halo-removed measures to
 other, independently developed proxies for similar constructs. We also com-
 pare the results of our method for removing the financial performance halo
 with measures obtained using less satisfactory statistical techniques. Al-
 though our specific model applies to the Fortune data, we believe that our
 technique is broadly applicable and should be considered whenever wide-
 spread measurement error is suspected in survey data.

 Fortune's annual list of the most admired companies, published early
 each year since 1983, ranks large corporations on the following eight qual-
 itative attributes: quality of management, quality of products or services,
 value as a long-term investment, innovativeness, soundness of financial po-
 sition, ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people, responsibility to
 the community and environment, and wise use of corporate assets. The
 magazine collects data on the largest firms in over 30 industries. The survey
 sample includes 8,000 executives, directors, and market analysts, each of
 whom reports on the industry he or she follows. Industry analysts and ex-
 ecutives within an industry have been shown to be reliable and accurate
 raters of corporate strategy (Chen, Fahr, & MacMillan, 1993). With a response
 rate of about 50 percent, Fortune's survey sample is probably larger than
 most samples obtained by academic researchers and its members are prob-
 ably more qualified and better informed. The results are widely circulated
 and cited in popular press outlets. In short, this survey offers data from a
 large sample of industry experts assessing qualitative dimensions of organ-
 izational performance that are difficult to measure quantitatively.

 Unfortunately, the Fortune most admired ratings have been shown to be
 heavily influenced by previous financial performance. Financial perfor-
 mance, which is generally measured by combinations of accounting returns,
 stock market returns, sales growth, size, operating leverage, and so forth, has
 explained from 42 percent (McGuire, Schneeweis, & Branch, 1990: 176) to 53
 percent (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 250) of the variance (measured as ad-
 justed R2) of the overall rating of firm quality in the Fortune survey. The
 influence of financial performance is understandable: executives and indus-
 try analysts are very interested in financial performance. But this problem
 must be dealt with if the data are to be useful to researchers.

 The eight individual attributes of corporate reputation rated in this sur-
 vey have been shown to be very highly correlated. Fombrun and Shanley
 (1990) used factor analysis on the eight variables and extracted one factor
 that explained 84 percent of the variance. They concluded "that the eight
 attributes elicited from respondents were components of an underlying and
 stable construct of reputation" (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 245).1 However,

 1 Fombrun and Shanley (1990: 245) found that the combination of the eight reputational

 dimensions yielded an extremely reliable scale for overall reputation (ot = .97).

 researchers interested in finding a measure for a particular construct, such as
 social responsibility, will be disappointed to discover that Fortune's mea-
 sure, "responsibility to the community and environment," is analytically
 indistinguishable from any of the other reputational dimensions, such as
 "wise use of corporate assets" and "innovativeness," which appear to be
 assessments of very different constructs. Halo is present whenever principal
 components analysis results in "a common general factor showing high
 loadings on nearly all attributes which accounts for appreciable variance"
 (Dillon, Mulani, & Frederick, 1984: 194). The Fortune most admired survey
 results are influenced by a strong halo, which renders the use of any single
 attribute ratings questionable. Unfortunately, many recent studies of corpo-
 rate social responsibility have relied on Fortune's ratings on responsibility to
 the community and environment (e.g., Chakravarthy, 1986; McGuire,
 Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988; O'Bannon & Preston, 1993; Sharfman, 1993).
 The financial performance halo affecting results for the individual cor-
 porate attributes rated in the Fortune survey poses a problem similar to those
 faced by researchers studying human resource management issues (e.g., Coo-
 per, 1981; Myers, 1965; Pulakos, Schmitt, & Ostroff, 1986; Thorndike, 1920)
 and consumer behavior (e.g., Beckwith & Lehmann, 1975; Dillon et al., 1984;
 Holbrook, 1983) as they struggled to remove distortion from the perceptual
 judgments of those rating individual attributes of people, jobs, and products.
 Both fields generally refer to this perceptual distortion-a blurring of dis-
 tinctions among dimensions or attributes due to a strong overall impres-
 sion-as a halo.

 Many of the halo-removal techniques proposed by human resource
 management and consumer behavior researchers were appropriate for re-
 moving the halo from an individual rater's perceptions of an object (a person
 or product). However, the data available from Fortune are summarized: in-
 dividual raters' evaluations are unavailable and only mean data provided.
 Therefore, some of the more sophisticated halo removal strategies (e.g., Dil-
 lon et al., 1984; Holbrook, 1983) are either irrelevant or inappropriate in the
 current research setting.

 One simple strategy for removing halo distortions of attribute ratings is
 to ignore the problematic first principal component because it is usually an
 evaluative general factor (Dillon et al., 1984: 185). This strategy may be
 appropriate to multifactor solutions, but in the case of the Fortune most
 admired data set and its single-factor solution, ignoring the first principal
 component leaves nothing on which to focus.

 METHODS

 The method we employed to remove the financial performance halo
 from the Fortune ratings was a partialing-out strategy. We controlled for halo
 statistically by forming a halo index, a set of variables believed responsible
 for the presence of halo, and partialed the halo out of the ratings using a
 two-step process. First, the variables of interest (in this case, Fortune attrib-

 ute ratings) were regressed against the halo index (in this case, various mea-
 sures of recent financial performance). Coefficients generated in those re-
 gressions were used to "model" each attribute, and firm-specific residuals
 were calculated. These residuals (the portion of the Fortune ratings not
 explained by prior financial performance) were the halo-removed attribute
 ratings. As each attribute must be modeled separately, we performed the
 above procedure eight times.

 Sample Data

 This study is based on 234 firms that met the following criteria: (1) They
 were listed among "American's most admired corporations" in the February
 10, 1992, issue of Fortune. These were 1991 ratings since Fortune surveys are
 conducted during the fall of the year prior to publication of the issue con-
 taining the ratings. (2) Their financial data from the 1988-91 period were
 available on the 1991 COMPUSTAT tape.

 Halo Removal

 Fombrun and Shanley (1990) and McGuire and colleagues (1990) found
 strong correlations between the Fortune ratings and a number of financial
 and operational performance measures. Our halo index includes individual
 measures of corporate earnings, returns, growth, size, and risk, all of which
 are commonly used to measure corporate performance in the strategy and
 finance literature. Using multiple measures of financial performance would
 raise problems of multicollinearity and detract from parsimony. Therefore,
 we created our halo index using five financial and operating variables, com-
 puted as follows: average return on assets (ROA) = (ROAit + ROAit - 1 +
 ROAit - 2)/3; relative market to book value = market value/book valuefirm
 over market value/book valueindustry; sales = logarithm of salesit; growth =
 (percent change in salest + . . . + percent change in salest - 2)/3; and risk
 = debtit/equityit. Several other variables commonly used in financial stud-
 ies, including stock market returns, were excluded from our final model
 since their results were not statistically significantly and did not add to the
 model's explanatory power. Table 1 gives summary statistics and the corre-
 lation matrix of the halo index variables and the raw Fortune attributes.

 These financial performance measures were employed as independent
 variables in regression analyses on the Fortune attribute ratings. Table 2
 presents the results of the nine regressions, one for each of the eight attrib-
 utes and one for the ratings combined. The regression of the combined For-
 tune ratings on the halo index had an adjusted R2 of .55, slightly greater than
 that reported by either McGuire and colleagues (1990) or Fombrun and
 Shanley (1990). The highest explanatory power existed in the financial per-
 formance attribute, soundness of financial position (59%). However, even
 innovativeness, which one might expect to be less correlated with financial
 performance, had an adjusted R2 of 36 percent. These findings provide fur-
 ther evidence of the presence of a strong financial performance halo in the
 Fortune attribute ratings. We calculated company-specific residuals from

 models developed using the variables and coefficients given in Table 2.
 These residuals are halo-removed ratings for each of the eight attributes,
 appropriate for use in research in which financial performance is also a
 variable of interest.

 VALIDATION TESTS

 To demonstrate the validity of the halo-removed ratings, we compared
 the halo-removed rating on four of these Fortune attributes with indepen-
 dent evaluations of corporate performance on similar attributes. We also
 compared our halo-removed measures with those obtained using a common
 factor process that removed most of the correlations among the Fortune
 attributes. Our final test employed a criss-cross analysis to ensure that our
 halo-removed attributes were meaningfully different from one another and
 that each was the best measure of the construct it was supposed to measure.

 Comparison with Independent Evaluations

 Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc. (KLD) applied a series of "social
 screens," each composed of several individual, objective measures of a cor-
 poration's social responsibility, to the hundreds of firms that it tracks. KLD,
 an investment advisory service specializing in identifying socially respon-
 sible companies for investors, used these measures to create the Domini 400
 social index of corporations exhibiting social responsibility. Our database
 had 196 companies that were included in both Fortune's 1992 most admired
 companies list and the KLD database for 1991.

 Each KLD measure of social responsibility is rated dichotomously (0 or
 1), so they are a coarse measures but adequate for validation purposes. From
 the KLD screens, we selected items that appeared to measure at least a
 portion of the Fortune attributes and formed scales to represent four of our
 halo-removed attribute ratings. For our first two proxies, we summed the
 chosen KLD measures, with strengths having positive values and concerns
 having negative values, to obtain greater range. The last two proxies were
 single-item scales with limited range.2

 The scales formed were as follows: (1) Fortune's responsibility to the
 community and environment was represented by community and environ-
 ment, a scale formed from 23 KLD items. Given that the KLD database was
 developed to track corporate social responsibility, the large number of items
 in this scale is not surprising. (2) Fortune's ability to attract, develop, and
 keep talented people was represented by five KLD items that we designated
 employee relations. (3) For Fortune's quality of products or services, we

 2 Descriptions and summary statistics of the KLD measures are available upon request. We

 chose items for their face validity. The two multiple-item scales are not reliable in a statistical
 sense. The KLD scales are formed from dichotomous variables, which on the average are scored
 1 on only 8 percent of the observations. The range in the KLD data is very limited, and treating
 individual items as continuous measures is questionable. And because the individual KLD
 items measure specific attributes that are relatively independent but collectively measure a
 single broad construct, such as responsibility to the community and environment, scale reli-
 ability as measured by Cronbach's alpha can be expected to be low.

 used a single KLD item, "The company has a reputation for high quality
 products or services relative to others in its industry." (4) For Fortune's
 innovativeness, we also used a single KLD item, "The company is consis-
 tently among the leaders in its industry in research and development (R&D)
 expenditures as a percentage of sales, or the company has a reputation for
 exceptional inventiveness in new product development."

 Table 3 presents the correlations between the four halo-removed For-
 tune attributes and their corresponding KLD social screen proxies. We per-
 formed a series of four simple regression analyses of the halo-removed at-
 tributes on their corresponding KLD proxies. The regression for responsibil-
 ity to the community and environment had an R2 of .11; for ability to attract,
 develop, and keep talented people, the R2 was .09; for quality of products or
 services, the R2 was .13; and for innovativeness, the R2 was .02.3 Results of
 the first three regressions were significant at p < .0001, and the innovative-
 ness equation was significant at p = .02. We concluded that these regression
 analyses supported the validity of the halo removal process and the halo-
 removed measures.4

 3The explanatory power of each regression analysis was limited by the relatively small
 number of positive observations on most of the KLD database items. For instance, only eight
 companies (about 4%) were rated as particularly innovative.

 4Regression analyses of the raw Fortune attributes (before halo removal) on the same four
 KLD proxy variables also yielded significant results. Two of the four raw regressions had about
 the same explanatory power (adjusted R2) as our halo-removed variables. The raw scores for the
 third, quality of product, explained less of the variance than our halo-removed variable (8% vs.
 13%) and ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people explained more than our halo-

 Comparison with the Common Factor Removal Method

 We examined a different approach to removing halo distortions by tak-
 ing advantage of the single-factor structure of the Fortune data. The corre-
 lations among dimensions are attributed to a general or common factor (Jack-
 son, 1983). The portion of a corporation's rating on a dimension not ex-
 plained by the common factor is assumed to be specific to that dimension.
 Factor ratings can be used to develop an expectations model, the residuals of
 which are the dimensions or attribute ratings purged of the common factor,
 or halo. This common factor removal method is designed to remove all the
 shared variance captured by that first principal component.

 In this sample factor analytic model, a company's rating on any attribute

 (Zjj) is the sum of three components: Zij = a?fi + mi + djuij, where i iden-
 tifies a company, j identifies an attribute, aj represents the loading of the jth
 attribute on the common factor, fi represents the factor scores of the indi-
 vidual company, mj is the mean score for all companies on attribute j, dj is
 a constant across all companies for the jth attribute, and uij is an unobserved
 variable, both company-specific and attribute-specific. The individual com-
 panies' attribute-specific scores, djuij, can be determined from the above
 equation (djuij = Zij - ajfi - mj) and can be considered halo-removed
 measures.

 The assumption underlying this model is that the true constructs are
 independent and uncorrelated. But the apparent purity of the measures ob-
 tained using this technique can present a problem; often a researcher sus-
 pects that the underlying constructs are correlated. For instance, in analyz-
 ing Fortune's most admired companies, it is reasonable to assume some
 "construct content overlap" (Spector, 1987) among even such nonfinancial
 variables as quality of management, ability to attract, develop, and keep
 talented people, and innovativeness. Good management may be reflected in
 progressive personnel policies and a record of innovation. Use of the com-
 mon factor removal technique will treat what may well be construct content
 overlap as measurement error and eliminate it, sacrificing potentially useful
 information. However, we demonstrate the common factor removal process
 and compare its results with those of our preferred method of halo removal.
 Correlation tables can illustrate some differences between our method
 and the common factor removal method. Table 4 presents three correlation
 matrixes in one: correlations of the raw Fortune rankings appear in plain
 type; those for the halo-removed variables derived from our method appear
 in parentheses; and those for the variables obtained from the common factor
 removal process appear in italics. We made no attempt to show correlations

 removed variable (15% vs. 11%). But in most research using these attribute ratings, the point is
 not to demonstrate their validity, but to measure their effects on other variables, frequently
 those measuring financial performance. Even though our halo-removed measures did not al-
 ways explain more of the variance of the KLD screens than their associated raw measures, it
 would be ill-advised to perform analyses with the latter as they are so heavily influenced by
 financial performance.

 among the raw variables and the two types of halo-removed variables. Using
 our preferred method, we reduced correlations by an average of 13.3 percent.
 The common factor removal process greatly reduced correlations, leaving
 many negative values.

 As expected, our controlled halo removal technique (it is controlled in
 that we are removing only the financial performance halo from the measure-
 ments) yielded measures that are much more closely associated with the
 independent proxy variables than those obtained using the common factor
 removal process. We conducted regression analyses using variables with
 common factors removed for responsibility to the community and environ-
 ment, ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people, quality of prod-
 ucts or services, and innovativeness on our associated KLD social screen
 proxies, but only the results for innovativeness were significant, explaining
 2 percent of the variance-about the same amount our preferred method had
 explained (results are available upon request). Kemery and Dunlap used
 Monte Carlo techniques to show that partialing out the first factor to remove

 method variance can introduce spurious negative correlations and "thor-
 oughly confound subsequent analysis" (1986: 529). Our results support their
 findings. Therefore, we consider our halo removal process, which removes
 only the known financial performance halo, not all correlations with other
 attributes, superior.

 Further Validation Using a Criss-Cross Design

 Another test of validity employed a criss-cross design (Seltzer & Bass,
 1990). If our halo-removed measures are to be useful, each must explain
 more of the variance of the corresponding proxy we developed from the KLD
 social screens than do any of the other halo-removed Fortune attributes.
 Some explanatory power from the crossed regression equations is acceptable
 given the assumed construct content overlap, but the appropriate equations
 should have more explanatory power. In every case, we found that regres-
 sions of the appropriate halo-removed Fortune attributes on their corre-
 sponding KLD social screens explained more variance than regressions of
 crossed or mismatched Fortune attributes on the KLD social screens (results
 are available upon request). We concluded that the criss-cross tests further
 support the validity of our halo removal procedure.

 CONCLUSIONS

 This article demonstrates the extent to which financial performance
 influences the ratings of Fortune's most admired companies and presents a
 technique for removing that halo to derive the underlying construct. In our
 research, we validated that technique by demonstrating a strong association
 between four of the halo-removed variables and proxy variables developed
 from another data source (Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co.) and by dem-
 onstrating our method's superiority to the common factor removal and criss-
 cross design processes. Researchers wishing to use Fortune's ratings for at-
 tributes that can be theoretically distinguished from financial performance
 should remove the financial performance halo before using the data, espe-
 cially if they are testing the impact of one or more of these attributes on
 corporate financial performance or stock market returns. If the financial
 performance halo is not removed, the use of the Fortune most admired
 company attributes will confound results. We suggest that the halo-removed
 technique demonstrated in this article is generalizable beyond its current use
 and that researchers consider its application before using measures derived
 from any survey results that may be heavily influenced by factors extraneous
 to the construct of interest.

 We suspect that the high correlations that remained after removal of the
 financial performance halo were largely the result of construct content
 overlap; many of the attributes are similar or theoretically related and
 would be expected to be correlated. The superior performance of our halo-
 removed measures (relative to the measures developed using the common
 factor removal process) in explaining the independent proxy variables sup-

 ports this notion. However, we also suspect that an additional halo not
 influenced by financial performance may exist in the Fortune data, a halo
 related to the construct of corporate reputation sought by Fombrun and
 Shanley (1990: 245). The factors that drive this possible corporate reputation
 halo and that halo's potential for confounding other research will be left for
 future investigations, but researchers should recognize those possibilities
 when using halo-removed measures in their research.

 Our results suggest several areas for future research. First, it would be
 useful if others would revalidate this technique by removing the financial
 performance halo from the Fortune database using other independent mea-
 sures. In addition, it would be interesting to see the technique applied to
 databases other than Fortune's survey. And finally, we would like to see
 halo-removed variables used in other research.

 Practicing managers should realize that the Fortune most admired com-
 panies rankings, although entertaining (especially if your company is highly
 regarded), are strongly driven by prior financial performance. Ratings of
 companies on single dimensions are not particularly informative because of
 that financial performance halo.
