Corporate Reputation and Social Performance:
The Importance of Fit

Stephen J. Brammer and Stephen Pavelin

abstract Utilizing data on a sample of large ﬁrms, we estimate a model of corporate
reputation. We ﬁnd reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market
analysts, to be determined by a ﬁrm’s social performance, ﬁnancial performance, market
risk, the extent of long-term institutional ownership, and the nature of its business
activities. Furthermore, the reputational effect of social performance is found to vary
both across sectors, and within sectors across the various types of social performance.
Speciﬁcally, our results demonstrate the need to achieve a ‘ﬁt’ among the types of
corporate social performance undertaken and the ﬁrm’s stakeholder environment. For
example, a strong record of environmental performance may enhance or damage
reputation depending on whether the ﬁrm’s activities ‘ﬁt’ with environmental concerns
in the eyes of stakeholders.

INTRODUCTION

The increasing importance of the constructs of corporate social responsibility
(CSR) and corporate reputation has, in recent years, been recognized within the
strategic management literature by a proliferation of conceptual and empirical
work (e.g. Fombrun, 1996; Hillman and Keim, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel,
2000; Podolny, 1993, 1994). The literature has paid particular attention to the
relationships between both CSR and reputation and corporate ﬁnancial perfor-
mance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Roberts and
Dowling, 2002; Waddock and Graves, 1997), consumer perceptions of product
quality (Milgrom and Roberts, 1986; Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001), employee
morale, productivity, recruitment and retention (Moskowitz, 1972; Turban and
Cable, 2003; Turban and Greening, 1996), company ownership characteristics
(Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Johnson and Greening, 1999), and access to capital
(Cochran and Wood, 1984; Hart, 1995).

In spite of this burgeoning interest in both CSR and corporate reputation, there
has been very little systematic research of potential links between the two. While
earlier studies identify a close relationship between corporate reputational capital
and social responsibility (Fryxell and Wang, 1994; McGuire et al., 1988), much of
this effort has focused upon establishing the meaning of reputational indices (the
Fortune ranking chief among them), and conclude that they are most closely related
to a ﬁrm’s reputation as a ﬁnancial investment (Fryxell and Wang, 1994). A seminal
empirical study by Fombrun and Shanley (1990) provides evidence that social
responsiveness, as measured by the level of corporate charitable donations and the
presence of a separately endowed corporate charitable foundation, is positively
associated with corporate reputation. Williams and Barrett (2000) provide more
recent evidence in support of a link between philanthropy and ﬁrm reputation. In
addition, they show that the link between philanthropy and reputation is stronger
among companies that more frequently violate occupational health and safety and
environmental regulations. They argue that, among other things, charitable giving
can partially restore a ﬁrm’s reputation after it has committed illegal acts (Williams
and Barrett, 2000).

Reputation has been deﬁned as ‘a perceptual representation of a company’s past
actions and future prospects that describe the ﬁrm’s overall appeal to all its key
constituents when compared to other leading rivals’ (Fombrun, 1996, p. 72). As has
been highlighted, deﬁnitions such as this emphasize the aggregate or summative
nature of corporate reputations that reﬂect the perceptions of a host of individual
stakeholders. A variety of deﬁnitions of CSR proposed both in the literature and by
a variety of institutions, emphasize a voluntary involvement in the solution of a
variety of social issues (e.g. European Commission, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel,
2001). Though often viewed as an aggregate construct, social responsiveness is
fundamentally multidimensional and embodies a large and varied range of corpo-
rate behaviour in relation to its resources, processes and outputs (Carroll, 1979;
Waddock and Graves, 1997; Wood, 1991). Demonstrating a high degree of social
responsibility may therefore require a diverse range of activities (including engage-
ment in philanthropic activities, reduction of environmental impacts, and the
introduction of practices that empower employees), each of which may have a
separately identiﬁable impact upon reputation. Furthermore, stakeholder groups
have differing expectations regarding ﬁrm behaviour (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990),
and the salience of each stakeholder group varies across industries. Therefore, the
impact of CSR activism on reputation is jointly contingent upon which type of CSR
activity is undertaken, and which industrial sector the ﬁrm is primarily associated
with. In this sense, the effect of a ﬁrm’s social performance on its reputation is
importantly determined by the ﬁt between sector-speciﬁc characteristics of the ﬁrm’s
business environment and the type of social performance the ﬁrm exhibits.

This paper analyses the relationship between corporate reputation and social
performance for a sample of UK companies. We use reputational data constructed

in a similar manner to the Fortune index (which has often been employed in previous
work), and make two contributions to the literature. First, we present the ﬁrst
systematic analysis of the relationship between reputation and social performance
that permits different elements of corporate social performance to have varying
effects upon reputations. Second, we explore how the reputational effects of different
types of responsiveness initiatives vary across industries. Our contribution is timely
in that it echoes recent work that emphasizes the importance of the manner in which
ﬁrms implement their social responsiveness initiatives (Porter and Kramer, 2002).
In the next section, we introduce a conceptual model of the link between social
performance and corporate reputation and introduce our hypotheses. The third
section describes the data; the fourth section reports the results, and a ﬁnal section
offers some concluding remarks and suggestions for practice.

THE DETERMINANTS OF CORPORATE REPUTATION

In this section we develop a model of the inﬂuences on corporate reputation and
outline a number of hypotheses. Our starting point is Fombrun and Shanley’s
seminal model which hypothesizes that corporate reputations are summative rep-
resentations of stakeholders’ opinions of ﬁrms which depend on their success in
meeting the expectations of those stakeholders (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). A
ﬁrm’s current reputation is determined by the signals that publics receive con-
cerning its behaviours, whether directly from the ﬁrm or via other information
channels, such as the media or the stock market. Stakeholders are expected to
have diverse preferences over ﬁrm actions, process and outcomes and reputa-
tional assessments depend upon the congruence between the apparent behav-
iours of the ﬁrm and the preferences of those publics (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990).

Following Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we differentiate between various types
of signals that relevant publics may receive concerning companies, and which may
inﬂuence their perceptions of the ﬁrm. Such signals vary according to whether they
originate within or outside the company, and with respect to the type of informa-
tion they contain. Our framework hypothesizes that a ﬁrm’s reputation is deter-
mined by signals concerning social responsibility and ﬁnancial performance,
product quality, ownership composition, size, media visibility and industry. We will
discuss each of these in turn.

The Link between Corporate Reputation and Social Performance

Existing work has argued that social responsiveness can play a signiﬁcant role in
promoting favourable relationships with primary stakeholder groups. Stakeholders
(such as shareholders, employees, consumers, pressure groups, Government and
regulators) that do not view the ﬁrm as legitimate have the power to either arrest

power from managers, or to at least hamper the execution of corporate strategy
(Mitchell et al., 1997). Such ‘salient’ stakeholder groups demand attention from
corporate management and, to the extent that ﬁrms behave in accordance with
their expectations, they will be willing to continue to participate in the activities of
the ﬁrm. To the extent that social responsiveness helps managers encourage
constructive contributions from stakeholders, we should expect it to augment the
ﬁrm’s reputation since the expectations of both managers and other stakeholders
are satisﬁed (Donaldson and Preston, 1995).

According to an alternative view, CSR activism represents a wasteful discretion-
ary act of management, born of altruistic impulse or the desire for self-
aggrandisement (Bartkus et al., 2002; Navarro, 1988). Within this view, one would
expect social performance to damage the ﬁnancial performance and reputation of
the ﬁrm (Friedman, 1970). Indeed, it may have a detrimental effect simply because
of a tendency for social investment to crowd out investment in other projects
(McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). That is, even if social performance would, ceteris
paribus, enhance the reputation of the ﬁrm, this effect is outweighed by the
opportunity costs associated with diverting resources away from other activities
that would do more to enhance corporate reputation (Russo and Fouts, 1997).
However, given evidence that is suggestive of the strategic use of CSR policy
(Porter and Kramer, 2002; Saiia et al., 2003), we expect the overall tendency to
be for social responsiveness to augment reputation, and propose the following
hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1: There is a positive relationship between corporate social perfor-
mance and reputation.

The strength and direction of the relationship between corporate reputation and
social performance may be contingent upon the activity a company is engaged in
since industry environments are correlated with signiﬁcant pressure from institu-
tional, and other, stakeholders (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Scott, 1987, 1995). This
suggests that industry may play a moderating role in the relationship between
reputation and social performance because of the presence of industry-speciﬁc
stakeholder pressures for improved social responsiveness from primary stakehold-
ers such as employees, customers, communities, and legal and regulatory bodies.
Such pressures typically arise because of the close association between some eco-
nomic activities and severe social and environmental externalities that lead to the
increased salience of particular issues in ways that lead to increased pressure on
companies to respond (Berman et al., 1999; Miles, 1987; Rowley and Berman,
2000). Moreover, satisfying the demands of these constituencies for improved
social responsiveness is in the interests of companies because ﬁrms are typically
dependent upon them for resources that are necessary to their continuing survival
and success (Clarkson, 1995; Hillman and Keim, 2001; Mitchell et al., 1997). In

light of the heightened relevance of social responsiveness for meeting the expecta-
tions of multiple stakeholders in some sectors relative to others, we hypothesize
that:

Hypothesis 2: Industrial sector moderates the relationship between social perfor-
mance and reputation, such that the relationship is stronger in sectors that are
associated with salient social and environmental issues.

Existing contributions have argued that understanding the wants of stakeholders is
of primary importance when attempting to design organizational responses to them
(Frooman, 1999), and that stakeholders are most likely to be galvanized into action
in circumstances where they share a clear preference for a particular action in a
context where the source of the concern is easily identiﬁable (Rowley and Berman,
2000). Therefore, it is likely that the overall reputational impact of social respon-
siveness is jointly contingent upon which dimension of social responsiveness is under
consideration, and which business sector the ﬁrm is primarily associated with.

Existing evidence suggests that the nature of focal social issues varies systemati-
cally across different industries. For example, earlier empirical work has identiﬁed a
number of sectors as having particularly high environmental impacts, e.g. the
metals, resources, paper and pulp, power generation, water, and chemicals sectors
(Bowen, 2000; Clemens, 2001; Hoffman, 1999; Morris, 1997; Sharma, 1997;
Sharma et al., 1999). Other industries are associated with alternative issues, for
example, the tobacco and alcoholic drinks industries are associated with highly
visible social issues. They are thought to produce large social externalities (e.g. crime
and health) and are subject to strong regulatory regimes (competition, safety and
taxation). Similarly, the defence and pharmaceutical industries receive particular
attention from ethical pressure groups, and the proﬁle of workplace health and safety
concerns is relatively high in the construction and resource extraction sectors.

Since the reputational beneﬁts of improved social responsiveness arise out of
meeting the expectations of stakeholders for the mitigation or reparation of social
issues, it follows that demonstrating good social performance that is perceived to
bear little or no relation to a ﬁrm’s activities may be thought of as wasteful
managerial excess, and so harm reputation, whereas examples perceived as rel-
evant are likely to be more favourably viewed. Hence, we hypothesize that the ﬁt
between a corporation’s social performance activities and its business environment
inﬂuences the link between social performance and reputation.

Hypothesis 3: Industrial sector and type of social performance interact to inﬂu-
ence the relationship between social performance and reputation, such that the
link between reputation and community (employee; environmental) perfor-
mance is stronger in sectors that are associated with salient social (employee;
environmental) issues.

METHOD

S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin

Our sample consists of 210 UK PLCs chosen largely according to the availability
of reputation data (see below[1]). Therefore, this sample, while drawn from a wide
range of industrial sectors, is not randomly selected. Instead, there is a focus upon
the largest ﬁrms within each industrial sector, including 90 per cent of FTSE 100
companies. Nevertheless, there is considerable variation in reputational scores both
within and between industrial sectors.

Corporate Reputation

To measure corporate reputation we utilize the ‘Britain’s most admired compa-
nies’ survey from Management Today, 2002, which employs a similar methodology to
that used to construct the Fortune index, a commonly-used measure of the reputa-
tions of US ﬁrms (e.g. Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994;
McGuire et al., 1988). The chairmen, managing directors and selected main board
directors of the 10 largest companies in 24 industrial sectors were surveyed, as were
analysts at a selection of leading investment companies. Participants were asked to
rate each company in their sector (excluding their own company) on a scale of zero
(poor) to 10 (excellent) for their performance in nine criteria: quality of manage-
ment; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to attract, develop and retain top talent; quality
of products/services; value as a long term investment; capacity to innovate; quality
of marketing; community and environmental responsibility; and use of corporate
assets. The assessments received for each ﬁrm were averaged across criteria and
respondents to produce a single reputational score.

Given our focus upon the role of social performance as a determinant, rather
than component, of reputation, it would be preferable to remove a score for
perceived social (community and environmental) responsiveness from these repu-
tational scores. Unfortunately, we cannot do this. However, we believe that this
component, which contributes only one ninth of the score, is dominated by other
aspects of reputation. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, there is evidence that
similarly constructed aggregated measures of reputation speak most directly to a
ﬁrm’s reputation as an investment.

Social Performance

Social performance data were obtained from the Ethical Investment Research
Service (EIRIS), who specialize in the measurement of corporate social perfor-
mance against a consistent and objective set of criteria, principally for the con-
sumption of investors. EIRIS survey ﬁrms concerning their social performance, but
also undertake their own research. As a result, they are able to provide social
performance scores for a ﬁrm irrespective of whether it participates in an EIRIS

survey. They offer the largest and most complete multidimensional social perfor-
mance coverage of UK ﬁrms, covering issues relating to employment, the envi-
ronment, community, human rights and supply chain management. Due to the
limited availability of data regarding the last two of these, we will restrict our
attention to the ﬁrst three dimensions of social performance.

Our indicator of employee responsibility is based upon ﬁve separate components
relating to health and safety systems, training and development, equal opportuni-
ties practices, employee relations and job creation and security. Similarly, our
indicator of environmental responsiveness is based upon four separate components
relating to the quality of environmental policies, systems, reporting and perfor-
mance. Our indicator of community responsiveness is entered as a single measure
by EIRIS. Following the general approach used by Graves and Waddock (1994)
for KLD data,[2] we translated the EIRIS text-grade rating for each measure into
a number-grade rating. Each environmental measure has ﬁve text categories; the
employment measures have three text categories, while community has four. We
coded each of the environment text scales into ﬁve point scales, each of the
employee responsibility text scales into three point scales and created a four point
scale for community responsiveness. In each case, the codes began with a value of
1 and larger numbers indicated more social responsiveness. To summarize, our
measures of the three dimensions of social performance are:

• Community performance graded 1 to 4.
• Environmental performance: policies; systems; reporting; and performance.

Each category graded 1 to 5. Environmental impact score out of 20.

• Employee performance: health and safety; training and development; equal
opportunities; employee relations; job creation; and job security. Each cat-
egory graded 1 to 3. Employment responsibility score out of 18.

To arrive at a single aggregate measure (termed social performance) we summed
the three scores having normalized each to a 1 to 4 grading. This generates an
overall score out of 12.

Control Variables

Corporate reputation is partly formed by signals concerning current ﬁnancial
performance whether such signals arise out of accounting data or stem from
movements in stock prices (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Strong ﬁnancial perfor-
mance generally signals an effective corporate strategy, good management, and
good resource allocations, and so helps a ﬁrm establish or maintain a good repu-
tation (Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Sabate and Puente, 2003), particularly among
groups of ﬁnancial stakeholders such as creditors, investors, and external analysts
(Fama, 1970; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). While external agents view ﬁnancially
successful companies favourably, they tend to be risk-averse. Therefore, if two

ﬁrms exhibit similar levels of ﬁnancial performance, it should be the ﬁrm that
appears to offer less risk that gains the better reputation (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990). In addition, a higher degree of leverage should, ceteris paribus, bring lower
reputational assessments, as it constitutes a burden upon future returns that may
threaten the medium- and/or long-term viability of the ﬁrm.

A measure of each ﬁrm’s proﬁtability (measured by the ratio of pre-tax proﬁts to
total assets) and corporate leverage (measured by the ratio of total debt to total
assets) were extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream. Data concern-
ing the market performance of sample companies was obtained from Barra Inc., a
leading risk specialist. We employ a b measure of the risks associated with stock
ownership that gauges the expected response of a stock to the overall market. A b
is an analytical tool, commonly employed by investors, to measure the volatility or
risk of stocks. It measures the extent to which the price of a given stock varies with
respect to the market as a whole. A b coefﬁcient is derived from a regression
analysis that estimates the effect, over a period of time (say, ﬁve years), of weekly or
monthly percentage changes in a market index on weekly or monthly percentage
changes in the price of an individual stock.

Broadly speaking, ﬁrms grow as a result of some measure of effectiveness in their
corporate strategic history, and so larger ﬁrms should be expected to garner a
better reputation than smaller rivals. Larger ﬁrms also tend to be more visible to
external agents, i.e. agents will tend to hold more information regarding the
activities of larger ﬁrms – an imbalance which may bias their assessments of
corporate reputation. Also, media exposure not only increases the stock of avail-
able information, but also sets the context within which it is viewed. For both
reasons, one should expect the extent of media exposure to inﬂuence assessments
of corporate reputation. A measure of each ﬁrm’s size (the natural logarithm of the
value of total assets) was extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream.

Many empirical studies employ ﬁrm size as a measure of visibility to external
agents (e.g. Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Bowen, 2000; Damanpour, 1987).
However, Bowen (2000) argues that size is an unsatisfactory proxy because it
captures much more than an organization’s visibility. Regarding an alternative
measure, Saiia (2000) argues for the use of readily available secondary data.
Consistent with these arguments, our approach is to use the incidence of news
media coverage of the ﬁrm as a measure of visibility.[3] This information was
obtained form the Factiva database, which provides searchable archives of news
content from over 8000 global sources. We gathered data for each of the calendar
years 1998–2002 inclusive, and used the natural logarithm of the average number
of annual news hits as our measure of corporate visibility.

Recent evidence suggests that the composition of a ﬁrm’s shareholder constitu-
ency, across a broad spectrum of investor groups, exerts a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
various aspects of ﬁrm behaviour. Institutional investors are motivated to become
more engaged with corporate management because of their increased visibility and

because they are ‘tied in’ to their investments in the sense that, given their size, they
have reduced ﬂexibility to sell investments without signiﬁcantly damaging their
value (Ryan and Schneider, 2002). A strong presence of institutional shareholders
may therefore signal to other stakeholders that the ﬁrm’s performance is keenly
monitored and deemed to be satisfactory by these relatively well-informed and
experienced investors. Ownership data were drawn in June 2002 from a share
ownership analysis database of more than 2000 listed UK ﬁrms managed by one
of the UK’s largest company registrars. Derived from records of share trading on
the London Stock Exchange, the database disaggregates share ownership accord-
ing to 32 different types of beneﬁcial owner. Following Ryan and Schneider (2002)
and Johnson and Greening (1999), we employ a variable that equals the sum of the
proportions of ﬁrm equity held by long-term institutional investor groups, i.e.
pension funds, insurance companies and life assurors.

A link has often been drawn between a ﬁrm’s reputation and the perceived
quality of its product range, such that ﬁrms perceived to produce high quality
goods tend to enjoy better reputations (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). In light of
this, one should expect corporate reputation to be augmented by those activities
most closely associated with the vertical differentiation of products: technological
advancement and the cultivation of a strong brand image. Accordingly, we
hypothesize that reputation is increasing in a ﬁrm’s research and development
(R&D) and advertising intensities. A measure of each ﬁrm’s R&D intensity (the
ratio of R&D expenditures to total assets) was extracted from accounting data
courtesy of DataStream. As there is no statutory obligation to disclose such expen-
ditures, ﬁrm-level advertising data are difﬁcult to obtain for UK ﬁrms. However,
media research agencies monitor the incidence of advertisements at the brand
level throughout the main advertising media (TV, newspapers, magazines, radio,
posters, etc) and estimate the levels of expenditure incurred. We construct a
dummy variable on the basis of identiﬁcation, by Marketing magazine in 2002, of
a ﬁrm as one of the ‘Top 100 Advertisers’ or as an owner of one of the ‘Biggest
Brands’ in the UK. Given that the levels of expenditure on advertising tail off
dramatically at the foot of these rankings we are conﬁdent that our methodology
allows us to capture the vast majority of the ﬁrms for which advertising is a key
competitive tool.

Finally, it may be that, even controlling for ﬁnancial performance and all the
other ﬁrm attributes we have discussed, reputation varies systematically across
sectors. This is to say, some business activities may predispose a ﬁrm to a better
reputation than do other activities. Each ﬁrm’s principle business activity (approxi-
mately equivalent to the three-digit NACE industry) was extracted from account-
ing data courtesy of DataStream. Using the DataStream industry classiﬁcation, we
allocated each ﬁrm to one of twelve sectors: business services, chemicals,[4] con-
struction, consumer products, engineering, ﬁnance, high technology, publishing,
resources, retail, transportation, and utilities.

RESULTS

S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin

We present OLS regression results for an econometric model of corporate repu-
tation that incorporates the explanatory variables described in the previous section.
Table I presents descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for key variables.
Diagnostic testing provides evidence of heteroscedasticity in all but one of the
regressions presented. In light of this, we employ White’s method to correct for bias
in statistical
inference. In the presence of heteroscedasticity, White’s method
adjusts standard errors to facilitate the drawing of sound inferences concerning
statistical signiﬁcance (White, 1980). We note that heteroscedasticity does not bias
parameter estimates, but that more efﬁcient parameter estimates can be obtained
through the use of either weighted least squares or MLE if the sources of the
heteroscedasticity are identiﬁed. Unfortunately, we can make no such identiﬁca-
tion. To test for simultaneity in the relationships between corporate reputation and
both social performance and ﬁnancial performance, we carried out Durbin–Wu–
Hausman tests as suggested in Davidson and MacKinnon (1993). In both cases, we
found no evidence of simultaneity and conclude that the estimates provided by
ordinary least squares are consistent. We ﬁrst present results that restrict social
performance to a reputational effect that is the same in all sectors. We also impose
the constraint that all types of social performance must have the same effect on
reputation. Both of these restrictions are subsequently dropped as we progress
towards our preferred model speciﬁcation.

Selecting the Most Suitable Model Speciﬁcation

Table II presents the results for three speciﬁcations. All three use a single measure
of social performance. The ﬁrst omits the set of sectoral dummy variables that are
included in the second and third regressions. The third also includes interaction
between social performance and the sectoral dummies, thereby permitting the
reputational effect of social performance to vary systematically across sectors.

Regression 1 provides a point of departure with the existing literature by exam-
ining a set of explanatory variables that overlaps considerably with those employed
by Fombrun and Shanley (1990). Consistent with Fombrun and Shanley’s results,
we ﬁnd that ﬁrm reputation is positively associated with current ﬁnancial perfor-
mance, as measured by proﬁtability (p = 0.026), with the degree of long-term
institutional ownership (p = 0.000), and negatively associated with market risk
(p = 0.009). These results provide further conﬁrmation of the ﬁndings of Fryxell
and Wang (1994) which suggest that reputational indices are highly correlated with
facets of corporate ﬁnancial performance. In contrast with Fombrun and Shanley
(1990), we ﬁnd corporate media visibility to have a signiﬁcant positive effect on
reputation (p = 0.041).

Taking these three regressions together, we can draw some conclusions about the
suitability of each speciﬁcation. That signiﬁcant coefﬁcients are associated with a

number of the sectoral dummy variables in regressions 2 and 3, justiﬁes their
inclusion in the model. Similarly, the inclusion of the interaction variables is justiﬁed
by a number of signiﬁcant associated coefﬁcients in regression 3. Therefore, of the
ﬁrst three regressions, the third seems to represent the most suitable speciﬁcation.
Indeed, we note that as the speciﬁcation is developed by adding industry effects and
interactions, the adjusted R-squared statistic rises from 0.206 to 0.403. The pattern
identiﬁed across the sectoral dummy variables suggests, consistent with earlier
observations, that it is important to control for industry in studies of corporate
reputation, particularly when measures of reputation are industry-speciﬁc in the
sense that respondents are asked to rate ﬁrms relative to industry peers (Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990).

Table III also presents results for three speciﬁcations, but in each case social
performance is disaggregated into its constituent parts. Following the same pattern
as Table III, regression 4 omits a set of sectoral dummy variables that are included
in regressions 5 and 6, the latter of which also includes interaction between the
various dimensions of social performance and a selection of sectoral dummies. This
selection was obtained from an iterative procedure, which began with each dimen-
sion of social performance being interacted with all
(but one) of the sectoral
dummies (see the appendix for regression results for this full model). This speciﬁ-
cation brought a huge increase in the number of parameters to be estimated (from
22 to 55). To recover some degrees of freedom, we undertook a process of reﬁne-
ment that sought to isolate just those interactions for which evidence could be
found. Accordingly, the least signiﬁcant of these interaction variables was omitted
and the regression re-run. This procedure was repeated until all remaining inter-
action variables were signiﬁcant at the 90 per cent level of conﬁdence. Only 9 of the
33 interactions secured a place in the ﬁnal speciﬁcation.

Again, that signiﬁcant coefﬁcients are associated with a number of the sectoral
dummy variables in regressions 5 and 6, and a number of the interaction variables
in regression 6, justiﬁes their inclusion in both cases. As the speciﬁcation is devel-
oped by adding industry effects and selected interactions, the adjusted R-squared
statistic rises from 0.233 to 0.481. Therefore, of these three model speciﬁcations, it
is that used in regression 6 that appears the most suitable. Furthermore, signiﬁcant
variation across the various types of social performance (as shown in regressions 4,
5 and 6) indicates that regression 6 should be preferred to regression 3, and so is the
most suitable of all the speciﬁcations presented – as reﬂected in its superior
explanatory power relative to the other speciﬁcations.

Regression 6 provides good evidence in support of roles in determining repu-
tation played by a number of our control variables: ﬁnancial performance,
market risk and long-term institutional ownership.[5] However, we ﬁnd no sig-
niﬁcant roles for leverage, ﬁrm size, media exposure, R&D intensity and adver-
tising intensity. As mentioned above, there is also strong evidence that reputation

Corporate Reputation and Social Performance

reputation lies in engineering and construction; the greatest predisposition to a
bad reputation resides in the resources, ﬁnance and utilities sectors.

DISCUSSION

In describing our ﬁndings, we will of course ultimately draw upon the speciﬁcation
we have selected as the most suitable. However, some lessons regarding the effect
of social performance can be gleaned from the manner in which its effect varies
across the regression results as a whole. For example, the ﬁrst regression attributes
no signiﬁcant effect to social performance, but once reputation is permitted to vary
systematically across sectors, there is evidence of a signiﬁcant role. Speciﬁcally, the
second regression shows that, when taking all sectors together, reputation is
increasing in social performance. However, the third regression shows that this
relationship is subject to signiﬁcant cross-sector variation. Indeed, the signiﬁcant
role is restricted to the chemicals, consumer products, ﬁnance, resources and
transportation sectors, where the effect is positive in all cases.

Regressions 4 and 5 imply that the signiﬁcance of social performance for repu-
tation resides only within community performance. However, once the impact of
the environmental and employee dimensions of social performance is permitted to
vary across sectors (as reported in regression 6), both are found to have statistically
signiﬁcant effects on reputation. Environmental performance is predicted to harm
reputation (p = 0.019) in all but the chemicals, consumer products, resources and
transportation sectors, where it has a positive reputational effect (p = 0.063,
p = 0.006, p = 0.000, and p = 0.033, respectively). Three of these sectors (chemi-
cals, resources, and transport) are commonly identiﬁed as industries with salient
environmental issues within the environmental management literature (Bowen,
2000; Clemens, 2001; Halme and Huse, 1996; Sharma et al., 1999).

Employee performance is predicted to inﬂuence reputation only in the resources
sector, where it has a detrimental effect (p = 0.064). The comparatively low overall
signiﬁcance of employee responsibility in regression 6 may reﬂect the fact that
employee responsibility is, relative to other dimensions of social performance,
comparatively invisible from outside the organization and therefore has only a
muted impact on the impressions external agents have of companies. Alternatively,
it may be that employee responsibilities play only a minor role in inﬂuencing
reputations because they are associated with legal compliance issues to which all
companies are subject.

The positive overall effect of community performance, shown in regressions 4 and
5, is reﬂected in the results for regression 6 in all but one sector, resources, where
there is a signiﬁcant negative effect (p = 0.000). Thus, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive
impact of community responsiveness that operates in 11 of the 12 industrial sectors
examined in our study. It is this dimension of CSR policy that exerts the inﬂuence on
reputation that is most widely felt across industrial sectors. This signiﬁcant role for

community involvement is consistent with the evidence for philanthropic expendi-
tures identiﬁed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990) and Williams and Barrett (2000).
Furthermore, while there is a general tendency for community performance to build
reputation in these 11 sectors (p = 0.000), the greatest effect is found in two of them:
Engineering (p = 0.023) and Finance (p = 0.000).

We can use these ﬁndings to evaluate Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. Regressions 3 and
6 provide evidence in support of Hypothesis 2 (that the relationship between social
performance and reputation varies across sectors). Hypothesis 3 also receives
support, as regressions 4, 5 and 6 indicate that this relationship varies across the
types of social performance. As previously implied, we interpret this support for
Hypotheses 2 and 3 as reason to select regression 6 as the most suitable for
evaluation of the other hypotheses.

The evidence relating to Hypothesis 1 is somewhat mixed. Hypothesis 1, that
there is a positive reputational effect, receives support in respect of community
performance in all but the resources sector, and for environmental performance in
the chemicals, consumer products, resources and transportation sectors. However,
there is a negative reputational effect for community performance in the resources
sector, for environmental performance in all but the four sectors listed above, and
for employee performance in the resources sector.

It is worth reﬂecting upon how these ﬁndings relate to our previous discussion
concerning the perceived relatedness of social performance to the activities of the
ﬁrm. Consistency with that discussion would imply: that community performance
is perceived to be keenly relevant in all but the resources sector; that environmental
performance is primarily associated with the chemicals, consumer products,
resources and transportation sectors; and that no activity is perceived to be closely
related to employee performance. In response, we note, somewhat tentatively, that
the resources sector operates without close proximity to ﬁnal consumers, and that
there is signiﬁcant environmental impact in, at least some parts of, the chemicals,
consumer products, resources and transportation sectors.

CONCLUSION

Using data on a sample of large UK ﬁrms, we present a model of corporate
reputation. The analysis focuses upon the relationship between corporate social
performance and reputation and is distinctive in two respects. First, we differ-
entiate between overall corporate social performance and its constituent parts.
Second, the varying inﬂuence of these factors on ﬁrm reputation across industries
is examined. We ﬁnd that different types of social performance have varying
reputational impacts and that these impacts are contingent upon which industry
the ﬁrm operates in.

In ﬁnding that social performance inﬂuences corporate reputation, we echo
the ﬁndings of previous work and provide further support for the notion that

social responsibility inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s market valuation. However, we reveal
signiﬁcant variation in this reputational effect across business activities and
various dimensions of social performance. In particular, our results demonstrate
the need to achieve a ‘ﬁt’ between the type of corporate social performance
and the ﬁrm’s stakeholder environment. For example, a strong record of
environmental performance may enhance or damage reputation depending on
whether the ﬁrm’s activities ‘ﬁt’ with environmental concerns in the eyes of
stakeholders. Community involvement, by contrast,
shown to have a
more generally positive impact upon corporate reputations, suggesting that good
community performance is expected by stakeholders in almost all
industrial
contexts.

is

Given the competitive importance of social responsibility and reputation, our
work is suggestive of a need to explore the role the concept of ‘ﬁt’ plays in
determining the effectiveness of social responsibility initiatives. Our results suggest
that ‘ﬁtting’ social performance to an industrial context implies good performance
in areas where stakeholders hold a general expectation of companies, such as seems
to be true of community performance, and demonstrating sensitivity to any
industry-speciﬁc issues, such as environmental impacts. Recognizing the impor-
tance of ‘ﬁt’ may help to resolve the inconclusive ﬁndings in the literature con-
cerning the relationship between social performance and ﬁnancial performance
(Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997).

Much of the literature regarding corporate reputation has centred on empiri-
cal study of US ﬁrms. Our analysis contributes to the small, but growing, body
of work focused upon other countries (e.g. Kitchen and Laurence, 2003; Mac-
Millan et al., 2002; Wiedmann, 2002) and offers an opportunity to examine the
international robustness of US ﬁndings. Broadly, our results are consistent with
earlier work in that we ﬁnd reputation to be affected by a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per-
formance, market risk, the extent of long-term institutional ownership, and the
nature of its business activities. These results suggest that the determinants of
reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market analysts, are
relatively robust across countries.

This study suffers from limitations that could be addressed in future work (see
also Heugens, 2004). First, our analysis is cross-sectional in nature and future
attempts to examine the patterns we have identiﬁed within a longitudinal frame-
work would both help to resolve remaining issues concerning causality and shed
more light on the evolving relationship between philanthropy and reputation
among UK ﬁrms. Second, our study, in common with much of the empirical
work in the area conducted in the UK, would beneﬁt from an improved avail-
ability of data, particularly regarding corporate reputation. We would welcome
time-series reputational data for a consistent and large sample of companies,
derived from alternative methodologies, such as those proposed by Gardberg
and Fombrun (2002).

NOTES

S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin

[1] We have reputation data for 240 ﬁrms. However, restricted availability of other data (principally

regarding institutional ownership) necessitated the loss of 30 of these ﬁrms from the sample.

[2] Kinder, Lindenberg, Domini and Company (KLD) are a social choice investment advisory ﬁrm

that objectively rates (mainly US) ﬁrms on nine dimensions of social performance.

[3] The chemicals sector includes pharmaceuticals. We tested the sensitivity of our ﬁndings to this
aggregation and found the omission of pharmaceutical companies from the chemicals sector
brought no material change in the results.

[4] Meznar and Nigh (1995) adopt a similar approach to measuring organizational visibility. They
measured visibility as the number of stories concerning a ﬁrm in ﬁve US national daily newspa-
pers over a 15 month period.

[5] The statistical signiﬁcance of each of these ﬁndings is indicated by the following p values: 0.078,

0.001 and 0.000, respectively.
