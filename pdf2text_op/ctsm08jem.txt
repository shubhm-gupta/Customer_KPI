Abstract

In spite of the widespread recognition of the important roles that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) play in most economies,
limited research has focused on their impacts on the natural environment and the strategies such enterprises adopt to reduce these
impacts. It is usually assumed that SMEs lack the resources to implement proactive environmental strategies that go beyond minimum
regulatory compliance. In this study of 108 SMEs in the automotive repair sector in Southern Spain, we found that SMEs undertake a
range of environmental strategies from reactive regulatory compliance to proactive pollution prevention and environmental leadership.
These strategies are associated with three organizational capabilities: shared vision, stakeholder management, and strategic proactivity,
hypothesized based on the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs—shorter lines of communication and closer interaction within the
SMEs, the presence of a founder’s vision, ﬂexibility in managing external relationships, and an entrepreneurial orientation. We also
found that ﬁrms with the most proactive practices exhibited a signiﬁcantly positive ﬁnancial performance.

frame the natural environment more as a strategic or
subjective issue than as a normative or ethical one
(Arago´ n-Correa et al., 2004; Banerjee, 2001; Cordano
and Frieze, 2000; Sharma, 2000), and therefore advocate a
strategic approach to promote change from within the
organization (e.g. Clemens, 2001). While we recognize the
complementarity and importance of both perspectives, in
this study we adopt a strategic focus in an under-researched
context: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Research on organizations and the natural environment
from the resource-based view of the ﬁrm (Barney, 1991;
Rumelt, 1984; Wernerfelt, 1984) has shown that proactive
corporate environmental strategies that go beyond regula-
tory compliance have a positive effect on corporate
ﬁnancial performance when mediated by valuable organi-
zational capabilities (e.g. Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995;
Marcus and Geffen, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma

and Vredenburg, 1998; Wagner, 2005). Studies have also
usually found that ﬁrm size has a signiﬁcant effect on the
degree of proactiveness, with larger organizations being
more likely to adopt proactive environmental practices
(e.g. Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003;
Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000).

The ﬁndings

that show that ﬁrm size affects

the
proactiveness of environmental strategies have perhaps
led to an assumption that SMEs’ lack of resources prevents
them from implementing proactive strategies and that such
initiatives may reduce their proﬁtability (e.g. Russo and
Fouts, 1997; Rutherfoord et al., 2000; Schaper, 2002). It
may therefore lead to the assumption that the ‘natural
resource-based view of the ﬁrm’ (Hart, 1995) may not be a
useful perspective for SMEs. However, the above studies
only include populations of
large companies in their
samples. Although some cases suggest that environmental
policy in lesser-developed countries should develop to
enable small-scale and artisan ﬁrms to form entities
that are of a sufﬁciently large scale to allow ade-
quate environmental protection (Tarras-Wahlberg, 2002);
this option is not necessarily useful for competitive markets
in developed countries. Therefore,
it cannot be con-
cluded from the available
that
SMEs are not likely to adopt proactive environmental
strategies or even that they may not possess valuable
organizational capabilities that enable them to generate
such strategies.

empirical

evidence

impact of

SMEs have also not been the focus of environmental
strategy research based on arguments about their presumed
lack of interest in going beyond regulatory compliance
(Greening and Gray, 1994; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma
and Vredenburg, 1998), the low degree of public interest in
SMEs (Scott, 1990), and the difﬁculty of obtaining data
from SMEs (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Rutherfoord et al.,
2000). However, SMEs produce around 70% of the total
global pollution (Smith and Kemp, 1998), 60% of the total
carbon emissions (Marshall, 1998), and the sum total of
SMEs’ environmental
impacts outweighs the combined
environmental
(Hillary, 2000).
Therefore, it is imperative that such assumptions about
the lower importance of studying environmental strategies
of SMEs be based on empirical data rather than on
conjecture. There is also broad agreement in the strategic
management literature that the strategic distinctiveness of
SMEs makes research focused in this context necessary
(e.g. Barney et al., 2001; Dean et al., 1998; Way, 2002).
Thus, strategic differences between big and small ﬁrms, the
scope of SMEs’ impacts on the global economy and on the
natural environment, and the absence of previous analysis,
all suggest the importance of giving detailed attention to
the issue of the strategic behaviour of SMEs in their
interface with the natural environment.

large ﬁrms

Accordingly, in this study we develop an organizational
size-dependent perspective that links the unique strategic
characteristics of SMEs—shorter lines of communication
and closer interaction within the SMEs, the presence of a

founder’s vision, ﬂexibility in managing external relation-
ships, and an entrepreneurial orientation—to the organiza-
tional capabilities that they are likely to develop and
deploy to generate proactive environmental strategies. Our
organizational size-dependent natural resource-based view
for SMEs addresses two questions: (1) Based on the unique
strategic characteristics of SMEs, which are the organiza-
tional capabilities
likely to be associated with their
proactive environmental strategies? and (2) What effect
do such proactive environmental strategies have on the
ﬁnancial and competitive performance of these SMEs? We
contribute to both: the natural resource-based view by
showing that SMEs can adopt proactive environmental
strategies based on speciﬁc capabilities associated with
their unique strategic characteristics, and the resource-
based view by identifying the type of organizational
capabilities that are likely to help SMEs develop their
competitive strategies in general.

2. Strategies of SMEs

2.1. Strategic management literature and SMEs

Despite the widespread recognition of the signiﬁcant
role that SMEs play in most economies,
the com-
petitive strategies of SMEs have attracted limited re-
search effort as compared to the focus on large ﬁrms.
This may be partly because early studies using the PIMS
database (e.g. Strategic Planning Institute, 1977)
re-
inforced the idea that large ﬁrms possessed numerous
advantages over smaller ﬁrms, and espoused the virtue
of growth-oriented strategies. SMEs were often margin-
alized as a residual class of ﬁrms that failed to become big,
that frequently used old fashioned managerial approaches,
that occupied secondary labour markets and niches
(Scranton, 1999), and/or that were less likely to use
strategic analysis and planning practices (e.g. Shuman
et al., 1985).

Later studies showed that certain advantages might also
accrue to smaller ﬁrms (e.g. Woo, 1987) and accordingly
research began to focus on demonstrating the effectiveness
of different strategies and practices for SMEs’ performance
(e.g. Risseeuw and Masurel, 1994). It was argued that
SMEs could gain advantage via focused (e.g. Brown, 1995;
Porter, 1980) or ﬂexible strategies for producing specialty
products/services for niche markets (Lescure, 1999) as the
only viable competitive options given their
lack of
resources (Lee et al., 1999).

2.2. Strategic characteristics of SMEs

Although the dominant perspective on SMEs has
emphasized their lack of resources (e.g. D’Amboise and
Muldowney, 1988; Eden et al., 1997), recent literature has
proposed that SMEs possess certain characteristics such as
internally generated funds, a simple capital structure, and
an entrepreneurial orientation of the founders/managers

(Rangone, 1999; Yu, 2001),
that can contribute to
competitive advantage. It has also been argued that SMEs
possess the ﬂexibility to respond to changes in the general
innovativeness to respond with
business environment,
agility to competitors’ moves, and closer
interaction
amongst organizational employees. Each of these char-
acteristics is discussed below.

Flexibility is probably the most widely cited among
SME characteristics (e.g. Chen and Hambrick, 1995;
Fiegenbaum and Karnani, 1991; Yu, 2001). Flexi-
bility allows SMEs to pay greater attention to managing
external relationships upon which they are dependant
for critical resources to survive, more so than larger
ﬁrms with larger internal resources. These include inter-
ﬁrm relationships (especially where SMEs are sub-contrac-
to large companies),
tors or parts/services
personal
relationships
them with new
market opportunities (Hendry et al., 1995; Conner and
Prahalad, 1996), and relationships with government
agencies
subsidies
and technical assistance for small enterprises (Darnall,
2002).

Entrepreneurial orientation and innovativeness have
also been cited as important characteristics of small ﬁrms
(e.g. Hitt et al., 1991; Woo, 1987). However, given that
SMEs have limited human resources,
the competitive
advantage from these characteristics depends mainly on
the managers-founder’s vision and her ability to extend her
views to the rest of the employees (Merz and Sauber, 1995;
Miller et al., 1988) and motivate their opportunity-seeking
and problem solving behaviour.

Finally, small ﬁrms may also be distinguished from large
ones in terms of the closer interaction among departments,
shorter lines of communication, better personal links, more
uniﬁed culture and stronger identity. While these features
permit easier communications and the generation of shared
understanding (Kogut and Zander, 1996), they may also
create problems due to the greater intensity of personal
interactions if shared values and vision are not sufﬁciently
strong (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1969).

In summary, while the literature on SME strategies
has traditionally focused on efﬁcacy problems because
of small ﬁrms’ potential
lack of recourses, conﬂicting
evidence for this argument has been found (Chen and
Hambrick, 1995). We argue that the unique characteristics
of SMEs’ enable them to develop and deploy certain
organizational capabilities which may be one of
the
main reasons for these paradoxical ﬁndings. Accordingly,
the following section develops arguments,
from a re-
source-based view of the ﬁrm, to link the three character-
istics discussed above—shorter lines of communication
and closer interaction within the SMEs, the presence
of a founder’s vision, the ﬂexibility in managing ext-
ernal relationships, and entrepreneurial orientation—with
the generation of proactive environmental strategies, and
the relationship of such strategies with SMEs’ perfor-
mance.

3. A size-dependent perspective on SMEs’ environmental
strategy

3.1. Corporate environmental strategies

In spite of differences in nomenclature, typologies of
corporate environmental strategy place ﬁrms’ environmen-
tal strategies along a continuum ranging from reactive
strategies that merely aim to meet legal requirements and
implement pollution controls, to more proactive strategies
that include voluntary eco-efﬁcient practices for reducing
energy and waste and pollution prevention practices that
require innovations in processes, products and operations
to reduce energy and material use at
to
environmental leadership strategies where products, pro-
cesses, and even business models are re-designed to
minimize the ecological footprint along the entire product
life cycle (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003;
Hart, 1995; Roome, 1992; Sharma, 2000; Sharma and
Vredenburg, 1998).

the source,

A proactive environmental strategy requires changes in
routines and operations and has been identiﬁed as an
organizational competence (e.g. Christmann, 2000; Hart,
1995) because it requires the complex coordination of
several human and technical skills and heterogeneous
resources (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993) in order to reduce
environmental
impacts and simultaneously maintain or
increase ﬁrm competitiveness. Extant research based on
samples of only larger ﬁrms has shown that organizations
with a larger size are more likely to undertake the most
proactive environmental strategies (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998;
Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000). Scholars have
consequently argued that because proactive environmental
strategies require accumulation of, and complex interaction
among, skills and resources such as physical assets,
technologies, and people (Ramus and Steger, 2000; Russo
and Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000; Shrivastava, 1995), SMEs’
limited resources might prevent them from adopting such
practices (e.g. Greening and Gray, 1994; Russo and Fouts,
1997). Although a curvilinear relationship between ﬁrm
size and environmental strategy may be possible based on
potential synergies between complementary assets (Christ-
mann, 2000), the lack of ﬂexibility of large ﬁrms, and the
limited resources of very small ﬁrms,1 to our knowledge
there is no evidence to support this relationship. The extant
literature supports a linear relationship considering that big
ﬁrms have greater access to the resources required for the
implementation of the proactive environmental strategies.
This generalized impression of SMEs has persisted
although systematic research on SMEs’ environmental
strategies has been absent from extant literature. Support-
ing this assumption, descriptive studies of SMEs have often
highlighted their poor level of environmental commitment,
describing them as mainly interested in controlling emis-

sions of pollution to comply with environmental regula-
tions
(e.g. Rutherfoord et al., 2000; Schaper, 2002;
Williamson and Lynch-Wood, 2001).

However, a few descriptive studies in several countries
contradict this assumption and have shown that SMEs
may successfully implement environmental strategies con-
sistent with the advanced environmental practices of big
ﬁrms (e.g. Bianchi and Noci, 1998; Carlson-Skalak, 2000;
Hillary, 2000) including innovations that prevent pollution
at the source rather than pollution control at the end-of-
the-pipe. Therefore, we argue that, contrary to the current
dominant thinking about SME environmental strategies as
being mainly reactive,
they are also likely to exhibit
proactive strategies based on certain organizational cap-
abilities related to the unique strategic characteristics of
SMEs.

3.2. Organizational capabilities for SMEs’ proactive
environmental strategies

Drawing on the natural resource-based view of the ﬁrm
(e.g. Hart, 1995) and the unique characteristics of SMEs
discussed above, we present arguments and develop
hypotheses in this section for the capabilities that will be
associated with SMEs’ proactive environmental strategies
based on a ﬁt with their unique characteristics discussed in
the strategic management literature. These capabilities are
(1) shared vision, which is related to the owner-founder’s
vision and the close interaction and communication
between the owner–founder and the organizational mem-
bers; (2) strategic proactivity which is related to SME’s
entrepreneurial orientation and innovativeness; and (3)
stakeholder management, which is
related to SMEs
ﬂexibility in managing their
inter-organizational and
external relationships. These three capabilities have also
been analysed in the natural resource-based view literature,
which is predominantly based on large ﬁrm samples (e.g.
Arago´ n-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Christmann, 2000;
Marcus and Geffen, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma
and Vredenburg, 1998). Our contribution in this study is to
develop a theoretical basis to identify a subset of the several
capabilities discussed in the literature that are relevant and
more likely for SMEs for developing proactive environ-
mental strategies.

3.2.1. Shared vision

The organizational capability of shared vision exists
when an organization’s members collectively have similar
values and beliefs about its objectives and mission (Oswald
et al., 1994). The capability of shared vision does not
simply mean that
employees know their managers’
objectives; rather, shared vision entails a shared feeling
that the ﬁrm’s objectives are important and appropriate
and that all of its members may contribute to deﬁning
them. Goal clarity and shared responsibility for organiza-
tional objectives are two basic characteristics of shared
learning and
vision and positively affect organizational

employee creativity at the interface between business and
the natural environment (Ramus and Steger, 2000).

Hart (1995) proposed that ﬁrms having a demonstrated
capability of shared vision would be able to accumulate the
skills necessary for developing a proactive environmental
strategy earlier than ﬁrms without such a capability
because these strategies depend ‘‘upon tacit skill develop-
ment through employee involvement’’ (Hart, 1995, p. 999).
Similarly, research on corporate environmental change
argues for the importance of employee support in the SME
context (Barret and Murphy, 1996; Ruiz-Quintanilla et al.,
1996; Wehrmeyer and Parker, 1996) although the empirical
evidence is mainly based on the large ﬁrms’ context (e.g.
Andersson and Bateman, 2000; Ramus and Steger, 2000).
On the positive side, as compared to large ﬁrms, SMEs
may be burdened with less bureaucracy and fewer
restrictions and provide more opportunities for direct
communication and shared experiences amongst organiza-
tional members (O’Gorman and Doran, 1999). On the
negative side, SME managers have been shown to have
difﬁculty developing clear objectives and communicating
with subordinates owing to lack of
resources and
unprofessional management (Smeltzer and Fann, 1989;
Way, 2002), and lack interest
in analysis offered by
employees during the process of setting precise objectives
and in reaching consensus among managers and employees
(Merz and Sauber, 1995). Therefore, size alone does not
make a shared vision capability intrinsic to an SME.
Rather, we argue that only the SMEs that are able to
exploit close interactions between the owner-founder’s
vision and employees into a capability of a shared vision
for a sustainable business are more likely to implement a
proactive environmental strategy. For instance, Raymond
et al.
is
positively associated with the implementation of business
process reengineering in SMEs. This leads us to argue that
the importance of a shared vision capability for a proactive
environmental strategy will be at least as high in SMEs as
in larger organizations. Therefore:

Hypothesis 1. A capability of shared vision will be positively
associated with the development of proactive environmental
strategies by SMEs.

3.2.2. Stakeholder management

Stakeholder pressures have often been cited as factors
contributing to the adoption of proactive environmental
practices by ﬁrms (e.g. Ce´ spedes-Lorente et al., 2003;
Cordano et al., 2004; Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999;
Sharma and Henriques, 2005; Wheeler et al., 2003). This
literature has mostly offered empirical evidence in the large
ﬁrm context for the importance of this capability for
generating proactive environmental strategies.

Sharma and Vredenburg (1998, p. 735) speciﬁcally
deﬁned this capability as ‘‘the ability to establish trust-
based collaborative relationships with a wide variety of
stakeholders, especially those with non-economic goals’’.


92

J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103

ARTICLE IN PRESS

Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) showed that environmen-
tally proactive ﬁrms usually view all their stakeholders as
important and actively manage their environmental con-
cerns and, for instance, Sharma and Henriques (2005)
linked speciﬁc stakeholder pressures to speciﬁc sustain-
ability practices by facilities
in the Canadian forest
products industry.

Stakeholders such as environmental non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) usually target larger ﬁrms (and not
necessarily the worst polluters), because these ﬁrms are
often the most likely to respond in order to avoid damage
to their reputations (Bianchi and Noci, 1998; Greve, 1989).
Small ﬁrms may enjoy a degree of anonymity and therefore
might be able to avoid undertaking some environmental
practices,
if they are so inclined (Dean et al., 2000).
However, SMEs that are interested in proactive environ-
mental practices need to pay careful attention to their
stakeholders’ interests. Although their small size provides
them with ﬂexibility in responding to changes in the general
business environment,
small ﬁrms are also seriously
challenged by unfavourable and hostile environments
(Merz and Sauber, 1995).

external

resources

SMEs have limited internal resources to survive hostility
by external forces and are less likely than large ﬁrms to
have access to media or publicity. Therefore, SMEs need
an organizational ability to be sensitive to the preferences
of, and collaborative with, relevant external groups to
garner
for adopting technologies,
processes, and systems required for proactive environmen-
tal practices. Understanding and managing societal con-
cerns via engagement in trust-based relationships can help
expand SME’s resources for undertaking proactive envir-
onmental practices through environmental coalitions and
alliances (Rondinelli and London, 2003), governmental
technological help and grants (Darnall, 2002), participa-
tion in green networks (Lehmann et al., 2005), and free
consulting (Bianchi and Noci, 1998). Similarly, Flannery
and May (2000, p. 646) found that, in a sample of 139
SMEs in the US metal-ﬁnishing industry, managers’
decisions and intentions concerning the treatment of
hazardous wastewater were inﬂuenced positively by ‘‘their
assessment of support from important others’’, that is
external stakeholders. McEvily and Marcus (2005) showed
how SMEs engaged their suppliers to develop capabilities
for pollution prevention. Therefore:

Hypothesis 2. A capability of stakeholder management will
be positively associated with the development of proactive
environmental strategies by SMEs.

3.2.3. Strategic proactivity

strategic policies

Strategic proactivity is a ﬁrm’s ability to initiate changes
in its
regarding its entrepreneurial,
engineering, and administrative activities, rather than
reacting to events (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998). The concept
draws on the prospector orientation described in Miles and
Snow’s (1978) typology and involves taking initiative to

shape the general business environment to one’s own
advantage (Chen and Hambrick, 1995). Proactiveness has
been proposed as a key dimension (with innovation and
risk taking) of an entrepreneurial orientation (Covin and
Slevin, 1990; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Miller, 1987) and
Stopford and Baden-Fuller (1994) showed that
these
dimensions help ﬁrms to gain new capabilities.

inﬂuence of

research regarding the

Based on data from 105 large ﬁrms in different Spanish
economic sectors, Arago´ n-Correa (1998) showed that
strategic proactivity encouraged adoption of proactive
natural environmental strategies. Although previous em-
pirical
strategic
proactivity on environmental approaches has been mainly
based on large companies, some evidence shows the
importance of strategic proactivity for small ﬁrms. For
example, Dean et al. (1998) showed that environmental
regulation of speciﬁc activities or sectors tends to generally
discourage SMEs’ presence but attracts speciﬁc kinds of
proactive SMEs. This ﬁnding is especially interesting
considering that small ﬁrms often show a greater propen-
sity for action than their larger rivals (Chen and Hambrick,
1995). Moreover, entrepreneurial orientation and innova-
tiveness are important characteristics of small ﬁrms (e.g.
Hitt et al., 1991; Woo, 1987) seeking focused niche
strategies in competitive markets dominated by large ﬁrms
with deep pockets (Lescure, 1999; Lee et al., 1999).
Therefore:

Hypothesis 3. A capability of strategic proactivity will be
positively associated with the development of proactive
environmental strategies by SMEs.

3.3. The inﬂuence of proactive environmental strategy on
SME performance

Although there is mixed evidence regarding the inﬂuence
of proactive environmental strategies on the ﬁnancial
performance of the ﬁrms (e.g. Bansal, 2005; Christmann,
2000; Margolis and Walsh, 2003), the majority of the
studies have found a positive relationship. This positive
relationship in the context of large ﬁrms (e.g. Klassen and
McLaughlin, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997) has been
explained as a result of mutual inﬂuence between proactive
environmental strategies and valuable competitive capabil-
ities
(Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995; Majumdar and
Marcus, 2001; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and
Vredenburg, 1998). The most proactive strategies focused
on business redeﬁnition and innovation in products and
processes to prevent pollution and waste at the source
enable an organization to align itself with changes in its
general business environment (Arago´ n-Correa and Shar-
ma, 2003), and have been shown to be associated with
lower costs, improved reputation, and generation of new
organizational capabilities (Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995;
Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). The adoption of mid-
range environmental strategies focused on eco-efﬁciency to
reduce energy and waste have been found to reduce

93

environmental impacts and simultaneously provide ﬁrms
with competitive advantage through reduction of costs and
addition of net value (Lehni, 2000; WBCSD, 2001).

Although researchers have extensively examined the
inﬂuence of environmental practices on large ﬁrms’
performance, studies of small ﬁrms’ environmental ap-
proaches have often used varying dependent variables. For
example, Flannery and May (2000)
investigated the
inﬂuences on shaping environmentally ethical decision
intentions, and Dean and colleagues (1998, 2000) estimated
the effect of environmental regulations on the formation of
small US manufacturing establishments. The descriptive
studies on SME environmental practices generally assume
that legislative pressures are the only way to generate
advanced environmental practices among small ﬁrms
because environmental activities do not have any positive
implications for SMEs’ performance (e.g. Rutherfoord et
al., 2000). However, Miles et al. (1999) emphasized that the
relationship between ﬁnancial performance and the adop-
tion of environmental standards for SMEs needed further
analysis. They stated that ‘‘it is reasonable to expect that
competent management and a more proactive stance on
environmental issues will be rewarded in the small business
sector as well’’ (Miles et al., 1999, p. 120).

Since organizational capabilities have been empirically
found to mediate the link between environmental strategy
and ﬁnancial performance in the context of large ﬁrms (e.g.
Christmann, 2000; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and
Vredenburg, 1998), we argue that small ﬁrms will reap
similar beneﬁts. However, in this study, we did not examine
these mediation effects and leave it for future research. We
propose that there will also be a direct relationship between
proactive environmental strategy and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance based on the arguments presented above.

Hypothesis 4. Proactive environmental strategies will be
positively associated with ﬁnancial performance of SMEs.

4. Research method

4.1. Sample and procedures

We used data from automotive garages, mainly truck
and car repair and maintenance facilities in Southern
Spain,
to examine our hypotheses. The automobile
industry has a major impact on the natural environment
(e.g. Orsato et al., 2002) at each stage of its life cycle—from
production, utilization and operation, repair and main-
tenance, to ﬁnal disposal. The garages focus on repair and
maintenance of automotive products which generates
signiﬁcant environmental impacts such as noise, high levels
of CO2 generation in tests, high levels of consumption of
energy and water, use of contaminants and toxic materials
such as chemicals and paint, and dangerous wastes.
Consequently, this industry is receiving growing attention
from legislators.

We initially interviewed six managers and key members
of an industry association of the automotive garage sector,
three consultants, and two academics interested in the area.
Data on SMEs’ environmental practices, performance, and
their organizational capabilities are not available from
published sources. Therefore, based on the interviews and
extant literature, we developed a questionnaire to measure
our constructs.

The population for this study consisted of all

the
automotive garages (210 ﬁrms) located in the region of
Southern Spain (including the provinces of Malaga,
Granada, and Almeria). All these ﬁrms were designated
SMEs according to ofﬁcial standards2 (European Commis-
sion, 1999). By controlling for industry and geographical
effects we limited our potential to draw broadly general-
izable conclusions but this allowed us to control for
extraneous confounding inﬂuences and focus on our
variables of interest. Our secondary research suggests that
the majority of the European automotive garages face a
fairly homogeneous context in competitive and legal terms.
Automotive garages also have many similarities with small
ﬁrms in other sectors including intensive competition,
complex regulation, and lack of resources—especially
ﬁnancial—as compared to larger companies.

Studies based on data gathered from SMEs usually tend
to be inconclusive because of very low response rates
(Merrit, 1998) or the difﬁculty that the respondents may
have in interpreting answers to questions (Smith and
Kemp, 1998). Therefore, we decided to administer the
structured questionnaire personally via interviews with
each informant. Additionally, because the vast majority of
the CEOs were native Spanish speakers, the questionnaire
was written in Spanish to avoid problems in interpretation.
All the items are provided in the Appendix after translation
into English. The personal survey administration took
signiﬁcantly greater time and effort compared to mail
surveys but allowed us to ensure the appropriate identity of
the respondents and their understanding of the questions.
These factors contributed to greater data accuracy and
reliability.

As is usual in strategic and environmental research (e.g.
Banerjee, 2001; Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Christmann,
2000; Flannery and May, 2000; Sharma, 2000), data were
collected from the general managers because they are the
most knowledgeable about their organization as a whole
and usually play a crucial role in designing environmental
strategies, especially in the SME context. To reduce
possible social desirability bias, we: (1) promised that
our analyses would be aggregated and no organization
would be identiﬁed individually; (2) randomly compared

The general managers of 149 ﬁrms agreed to participate
in this research and we were able to interview 126 of these
managers. Fourteen interviews were not used for this study
because of missing values, leaving a ﬁnal sample of 108
interviews representing 51.42% of the contacted popula-
tion. The sampled ﬁrms had an average size of six
employees. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between
the descriptive characteristics of ﬁrms that were included in

factor to account

Although a single informant in each ﬁrm is often used in
strategic management research due to the difﬁculty of
obtaining multiple informants
surveys, we
recognize the potential for mono-method bias in our data.
Therefore we increased the conﬁdence in our data by: (1)
undertaking a factor analysis which showed the absence of
a single general
the
covariance in our variables,
indicating the absence of
common method variance problems for our data (Podsak-
off and Organ, 1986); (2) comparing self-evaluation of
managers with competitors’ perceptions of their ﬁrms
which allowed us to compare managers’ responses with
external sources of well-informed evaluators (see footnote
2 for details); and (3) personally identifying qualiﬁed
respondents and administering the questionnaires. Pre-
vious literature has shown that the views of a single but
well-qualiﬁed informant may better capture a ﬁrm’s
approach as compared to the views of several respondents
in the case of small organizations where relevant decisions
are often highly centralized (Chandler and Hanks, 1993;
Lyon et al., 2000).

4.2. Measures

4.2.1. Environmental strategy

Due to limited or non-availability of publicly available
environmental performance data, a ﬁrm’s environmental
strategy has been usually measured in terms of self-
(e.g. Arago´ n-Correa, 1998;
perceptions of managers
Christmann, 2000; Flannery and May, 2000; Sharma,
2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). In our case, this was
the only feasible approach since there are no publicly
available data on environmental practices of garages in
Spain.

3A random sample of 46 managers from our ﬁnal respondent ﬁrms was
asked about the most visible environmental practices of one or several
competitors (usually nearby garages), resulting in a sample of 70 externally
evaluated ﬁrms. Averaging evaluations created external evaluations of
speciﬁc ﬁrms when several of them were available. A correlation of 0.71
between rate of external evaluations developed by competitors and self-
evaluations developed by managers for sampled practices increases our
conﬁdence in the data.

ranging from the most

We used two groups of items to measure the proactive-
ness of the environmental strategy of each garage. The
items were grouped based on theoretically well-differen-
tiated categories
innovative
prevention practices to the simplest eco-efﬁcient practices.
Although both groups of items include proactive practices,
they are signiﬁcantly different in terms of their complexity
and objectives, ranging from major changes in product and
process design to saving energy and reducing waste. These
have been analysed differently in extant literature (e.g.
Hart, 1995; Marcus and Anderson, 2006).

The ﬁrst group of practices was measured using 14 items
drawn from Arago´ n-Correa’s (1998) measure for environ-
mental strategies designed to cover the whole range of
environmental practices that a ﬁrm might adopt including
product and process innovations for pollution prevention.
Table A1 in the Appendix shows the results of standardized
varimax rotation of these items resulting in two signiﬁcant
factors (eigenvalues41). Responses were on a ﬁve-point
scale ranging from 1 for ‘‘we have not addressed this issue
at all’’ to 5 for ‘‘we are the leaders on this practice in our
sector’’. Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent scales were
created by using the same ﬁve-point response format.

The second group of practices included nine items to
evaluate the importance that managers gave to their ﬁrm’s
implementation of various eco-efﬁcient practices. These
environmental practices have been suggested as the ﬁrst
steps toward proactive environmental practices, and/or as
speciﬁcally applicable to SMEs (e.g. Schmidheiny, 1992;
Smith and Kemp, 1998). Exploratory principal compo-
nents analysis with varimax rotation showed that these
items formed two factors with eigenvalues41 (Please refer
to Table A2 in the Appendix).

4.2.2. Stakeholder management

Following previous environmental research (Buysse and
Verbeke, 2003; Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Flannery and
May, 2000), we used Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980) technique
as a guide to measure the capability of stakeholder
management. First, we listed nine categories of stake-
holders (such as local communities, shareholders,
the
media, environmentalists, and customers), and asked the
general managers to rate (from 1 to 5) the level of attention
they paid to each category in managing their enterprises.
Second, we asked the informants to evaluate (from 1 to 5)
their perception of the importance of each stakeholder for
the environmental performance of the ﬁrm. Similar to
Buysse and Verbeke’s (2003) methodology, we weighted
the managers’ attention to each stakeholder by the
perceived attention of each stakeholder to environmental
impacts of the ﬁrm. The scores ranged from 1 to 25, with a
higher score indicating a higher capability of stakeholder
management. Exploratory principal components analysis
with varimax rotation of those nine items showed that they
formed three factors with eigenvalues41 (Please refer to
Table A3 in the Appendix).

4.2.3. Shared vision

We used three items (shown in the Appendix) based on
previous literature on shared ideas about organizational
objectives and the ways in which employees inﬂuence those
objectives (e.g. Jehn, 1995; Oswald et al., 1994). Each item
was measured on a ﬁve-point Likert
response scale
(1¼‘‘strongly disagree’’, 5¼‘‘strongly agree’’). Exploratory
principal components analysis with varimax rotation of
those three items showed that they formed only one factor
with eigenvalue41 (Cronbach’s alpha ¼ 0:791). A high
average score was indicative of a high degree of shared
vision in a garage.

4.2.4. Strategic proactivity

We used three bipolar items from Arago´ n-Correa’s
(1998) validated scale measuring proactivity in a ﬁrm’s
generic business strategy (refer to the Appendix). The scale
draws on Miles and Snow’s (1978) well-known typology.
We asked each respondent to position his or her ﬁrm on a
scale of 1–5 that was constructed so that high values
matched a ‘‘prospector’’
strategy and low values, a
‘‘defender’’ strategy. We inverted this pattern for the
second question to avoid skewing the answers. Exploratory
principal components analysis with varimax rotation of
those three items showed that they formed only one factor
with eigenvalue41 (alpha ¼ 0:770). A high score was
indicative of high development of strategic proactivity in a
garage.

4.2.5. Firm performance

Strategy and environment scholars have used subjective
perceptions of managers (e.g. Judge and Douglas, 1998;
Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998) and objective data (e.g.
Russo and Fouts, 1997) to measure ﬁrm performance. We
included questions tapping both types of assessment in our
interviews, but the garage managers were more open to
offering their perceptions rather than to offering precise
quantitative data (only 61 offered quantitative data).
Therefore, we tested the model using a perceptual measure
of ﬁnancial performance in which each respondent rated
his or her organization’s performance relative to that of
other ﬁrms in the garage industry using two items (see
Appendix). These two items were drawn from Judge and
Douglas
(1998). These authors provide an extensive
discussion and details about the potential of this process
of measurement and similar processes in previous strategic
literature (e.g. Miller and Friesen, 1984; Powell, 1995). The
ﬁnal measure was an average of
two items
(alpha ¼ 0:69), and a high score was indicative of a high
level of performance in the garage as compared to the

correlation between the objective and subjective data.

4.2.6. Control variables

All our sampled ﬁrms were SMEs according to institu-
tional deﬁnitions. However, the breadth of this category

suggested the need to use organization size to control for
potential differences. The size indicators initially used were
annual turnover and number of employees. Both indicators
were highly and signiﬁcantly correlated in this sample and
we chose to use the number of employees. The logarithm of
an organization’s number of employees was used to
measure size. We also added a dummy variable to control
potential external inﬂuences based on whether or not the
garage was associated with an automotive dealer or was
independent.

5. Analysis and results

5.1. Analysis

In a preliminary analysis, the two variables measuring
proactive environmental practices were ﬁrst subjected to a
cluster analysis using a non-hierarchical optimising proce-
dure to determine whether different groups of similar ﬁrms
could be grouped on the basis of their environmental
strategies (Hair et al., 1998).

Buysse and Verbeke’s (2003) classiﬁcation of environ-
mental strategies suggested a three-cluster solution which
showed in our data a relatively small group of ﬁrms
(n ¼ 26) characterized by high levels of innovative and
preventive environmental practices and of eco-efﬁcient
practices. A second group (n ¼ 45) showed a high level of
eco-efﬁcient practices and an intermediate level of innova-
tive and preventive practices. Finally, a group of ﬁrms
(n ¼ 37) exhibited the lowest levels of both eco-efﬁcient
and innovative practices. We identiﬁed these groups as
exhibiting ‘‘leadership,’’ ‘‘pollution prevention,’’ and ‘‘re-
active’’ environmental strategies, respectively, based on
Buysse and Verbeke’s (2003) terminology. The ﬁrst group
exhibits the greatest proactiveness,
the second group
exhibits some proactive practices focusing on simpler eco-
efﬁciency solutions, and the third group does not exhibit
any proactive practices. A four-cluster solution would
divide the last group into two but not provide additional
information.

Although the cluster analysis was developed using
standardized values as recommended to avoid any inﬂu-
ences of scales, Table 1 shows average scores using raw
values for the different variables in each emerging group to
avoid problems in interpreting standardized values. The
‘‘leadership’’ group have the highest values for all the
analysed variables,
the ‘‘pollution prevention’’ group
shows intermediate values, and the ‘reactor’ group has
the lowest values for the organizational capabilities and
environmental performance. Test statistics from one-way
analyses of variance (ANOVA Fs) were all signiﬁcant
except for shared vision, showing the robustness of the
solution (Hair et al., 1998). Cluster analyses were repeated
on randomly selected sub-samples,
indicating that the
results can be considered independent of sample character-
istics (Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999).

Fig. 1. Hypothesized model.

The results show that the patterns of environmental
strategies for the sampled SMEs are congruent with
theoretical typologies ranging from reactive (‘‘reactor’’)
to the most proactive strategies (‘‘pollution prevention’’
and ‘‘leader’’). Our classiﬁcation is also consistent with
previous classiﬁcations for large ﬁrms (e.g. Buysse and
Verbeke, 2003). The values in Table 1 for the rest of the
variables suggest support for Hypotheses 1–4. Next, we
used a structural equation model for a deﬁnitive test of our
hypotheses (Fig. 1).

5.2. Results

We examined our hypotheses using structural equation
modelling (LISREL 8.3) with the covariance matrix as
input and the assumption of no error. This provided a
conservative test of the model (Hair et al., 1998) and was
estimated using the weighted least squares (WLS)4 method.
We used a recursive non-saturated model, taking shared
vision (x1), stakeholder management (x2), strategic proac-
tivity (x3), size (x4), and dealer afﬁliation (x5) as the

4The sample sized was 108. Sample size, as in any other statistical
method, provides a basis for the estimation of sampling erroryy. While
there is no correct sample size, recommendations are for a size ranging
between 100 to 200 (Hair et al., 1998, p. 637).

exogenous latent variables. Size and dealer afﬁliation were
control variables, innovative preventive practices (Z1) and
eco-efﬁcient practices (Z2) were the ﬁrst-grade endogenous
latent variables, and performance (Z3) was the second-
grade endogenous latent variable. Such analysis allows for
modelling based on both latent variables and manifest
variables, a property well suited for the hypothesized
model where most of
the represented constructs are
abstractions of unobservable phenomena.

Fig. 1 shows our proposed model and the hypotheses.
Table 2 presents the means, standard deviations, reliability
coefﬁcients, and correlations among the variables. Prior to
conducting our analyses, we followed the procedure
outlined by Bono and Judge (2003) for examining the
measurement properties of our three multidimensional
variables to prevent interpretational problems inherent in
simultaneous estimation of measurement and structural
models.

for

As suggested in extant literature (e.g. Cordano and
Frieze, 2000; Flannery and May, 2000), the dimensions of
stakeholder management emerging from the exploratory
factorial analysis were highly interrelated in our data. A
second-order conﬁrmatory factor analysis (loading items
on the three dimensions on a single transformational
factor) demonstrated a reasonable ﬁt
the data
(w2 ¼ 18:95;
df ¼ 20; RMSEA ¼ 0:001; CFI ¼ 0:99;
IFI ¼ 0:99) with standardized loadings ranging from 0.97
to 0.40 (Fig. 2). Whereas this model is not a perfect ﬁt for
the data, because of cross-loading among some of the
items, alternative models were unambiguously rejected.
For instance, our model is a better ﬁt than a single-factor
model in which items are loaded directly on the ﬁnal factor
(w2 ¼ 137:56; df ¼ 27; RMSEA ¼ 0:195; CFI ¼ 0:74;
IFI ¼ 0:74). Hence,
the three factors were considered
indicators of a single measure, which we labelled ‘‘stake-
holder management.’’ Subsequent analyses were conducted
using a single factor for stakeholder management. The ﬁnal
measure was a weighted average of the three factors using
the standardized loadings obtained from the second-order
factor analysis, and a high score was indicative of a high
capability for stakeholder management.

the second-order conﬁrmatory factor analyses (loading the

IFI ¼ 0:87) with standardized loadings ranging from 0.97
to 0.45. Whereas these models were not a perfect ﬁt for the
data, because of cross-loading among some of the items,
alternative models were unambiguously rejected. For
instance, these models were a better ﬁt than a single-factor
model, in which items are loaded directly on the ﬁnal factor
of the innovative-preventive practices (w2 ¼ 39:10; df ¼ 20;
RMSEA ¼ 0:094; CFI ¼ 0:89; IFI ¼ 0:90) or eco-efﬁcient
practices (w2 ¼ 33:40; df ¼ 14; RMSEA ¼ 0:113; CFI ¼
0:87; IFI ¼ 0:87). Hence, the two factors were considered
indicators of a single measure, which we labelled ‘‘in-
novative-preventive practices’’ and ‘‘eco-efﬁcient prac-
tices.’’ The ﬁnal measures were weighted averages of the
two factors using the standardized loadings obtained from
the second-order factor analysis, and high scores were
indicative of high degrees of innovative-preventive prac-
tices and eco-efﬁcient practices, respectively, in a garage’s
environmental strategy.

Final results of this model, which are displayed in Fig. 2,
revealed that each ﬁnal
item signiﬁcantly loads on its
respective construct showing high convergent validity of
the measurement scale for each construct.
The hypothesized model provided an acceptable ﬁt to the
data (w2 ¼ 86:25; df ¼ 60; RMSEA ¼ 0:08; AGFI ¼ 0:89;
NNFI ¼ 0:89; CFI ¼ 0:92; IFI ¼ 0:91). All of the mod-
iﬁcation indices for the beta pathways between major
variables were small, suggesting that adding additional
paths would not
signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁt. The
statistically signiﬁcant parameters (see Fig. 2) predicting
that the capability of shared vision would have a positive
inﬂuence on the development of proactive environmental
strategies by inﬂuencing the innovative-preventive and the
eco-efﬁcient practices (g11 ¼ 0:38 and g21 ¼ 0:61, respec-
tively; po0:001) support Hypothesis 1. A positive and
statistically signiﬁcant parameter estimate for the path
between stakeholder management capability and innova-
tive-preventive practices (g12 ¼ 0:88, po0:001), and eco-
efﬁciency (g22 ¼ 0:23, po0:05) provides support for Hy-
pothesis 2. Hypothesis 3, regarding the inﬂuence of a
strategic proactivity capability on environmental proac-
tiveness, was also supported by the parameter estimates
(g13 ¼ 0:31 and g23 ¼ 0:24, respectively; po0:05). Finally,
Hypothesis 4,
regarding the relationship between a
proactive environmental strategy and ﬁrm performance,
was supported by positive and signiﬁcant parameter
estimates
the path between innovative-preventive
strategies and performance (b31 ¼ 0:31, po0:01) and
for the path between eco-efﬁciency and performance
(b32 ¼ 0:42, po0:01).

The inﬂuence of control variables was tested for each of
the three dependent variables in our model. The control
variable for
size showed a positive and statistically
signiﬁcant (po0:01) association with innovative-preventive

practices. The inﬂuence of size on eco-efﬁcient practices
and performance was not signiﬁcant for the sampled ﬁrms.
The analysis of the inﬂuence of dealer afﬁliation was not
signiﬁcant for our sample. We also ﬁt several nested models
to the data, each one incorporating different assumptions
about parameters (Bollen and Long, 1993). These alter-
native models indicated that our proposed model was
parsimonious and a good ﬁt. Detailed information about
alternative models is available upon request.

6. Discussion, conclusions, and future research

Our contribution is to show, contrary to conventional
wisdom in the extant literature, that even SMEs can adopt
proactive environmental practices and that these practices
can lead to superior ﬁnancial performance via speciﬁc
capabilities based on the unique strategic characteristics of
SMEs. Moreover, our research also contributes to the
resource-based view by showing that this perspective is
relevant for SMEs’ competitive strategies generally.

As we had expected, SMEs’ potential to adopt proactive
environmental practices is associated with speciﬁc organi-
zational capabilities based on their unique strategic
characteristics of shorter lines of communication and
closer interaction, the presence of a founder’s vision,
ﬂexibility in managing external relationships, and an
entrepreneurial orientation. These capabilities were shared
vision, stakeholder management, and strategic proactivity.
Our data clearly clustered SMEs’ environmental strate-
gies into reactive, pollution prevention, and leadership
categories, similar to ﬁndings for large ﬁrms (Buysse and
Verbeke, 2003) and ﬁrms with proactive environmental
strategies showed a positive and signiﬁcant relationship
with performance for our sampled ﬁrms, similar to the
ﬁndings for larger ﬁrms (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Judge and
Douglas, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997).

The simultaneous inﬂuence of ﬁrm size and organiza-
tional capabilities on innovative-preventive environmental
practices suggests that size, a common proxy for organiza-
tional resources,
is a relevant but not a deterministic
condition for developing the most proactive environmental
strategies. Therefore, our ﬁndings contradict the traditional
assumption that SMEs cannot develop proactive environ-
mental strategies owing to scarcity of slack resources. Our
results support the natural resource-based view perspective
(Hart, 1995) that indicates that organizational capabilities
are critical for strategies of both large ﬁrms and SMEs.

Furthermore, our results have shown that the capabil-
ities promoting the development of environmentally
proactive approaches in the sampled SMEs coincide with
those found for large companies in previous research (e.g.
Marcus and Geffen, 1998; Ramus and Steger, 2000;
Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Although researchers
concerned with organizational size have stated that what
applies to large ﬁrms may not apply to small ones, recent
studies (e.g. Flannery and May, 2000) and our own results
show similar relationships for large and small ﬁrms.

Traditional arguments in the small ﬁrm context may have
to be restated from the perspective of the resource-based
view, that is, large and small ﬁrms both require organiza-
tional capabilities for competitive strategies. However,
large and small ﬁrms may follow different paths and
generate different sets of capabilities based on different sets
of characteristics. Therefore, although some features of
these three capabilities for SMEs may be similar to those in
large organizations, the foundations for those capabilities
may be signiﬁcantly different
for big and small-size
organizations. While larger ﬁrms may deploy resources
such as sophisticated systems for knowledge management,
public relations campaigns, or signiﬁcant investments in
R&D to develop these three capabilities, small organiza-
tions may build these capabilities based on their unique
strategic characteristics discussed above.

We also showed a positive and signiﬁcant relationship
between innovative-preventive environmental practices and
eco-efﬁcient practices and ﬁrm performance for
the
sampled SMEs. The positive relationship between the most
proactive environmental practices and ﬁrm performance is
also consistent with those obtained for larger ﬁrms (e.g.
Judge and Douglas, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997), and it
shows that a proactiveness in environmental strategy may
be an appropriate alternative for both small and large
ﬁrms.

It is especially interesting that our results show, in a
SME context, a positive and signiﬁcant
relationship
between ﬁrm performance and eco-efﬁcient practices
analysed as a systematic pattern of simple but multiple,
consistent and co-ordinated practices that simultaneously
reduce environmental
impacts and organizational costs.
This is relevant for practitioners and policy makers because
eco-efﬁcient practices have been often suggested as ﬁrst
steps for adoption by small ﬁrms and others starting on the
path of environmental change. Viewed from a resource-
based perspective, this result may help to differentiate
between an isolated practice (e.g. switching off lights when
not necessary) and a systematic pattern of practices
demanding certain organizational capabilities (rather than
resources or critical size). Partial analysis of our data
indicates that certain eco-efﬁcient practices might indirectly
prevent the generation of organizational capabilities that

an isolated way by deterring innovation.

to the development of

The main limitation of our study arises from our
modelling of environmental strategy as exclusively a
function of internal capabilities. External conditions are
also relevant
environmental
initiatives (Arago´ n-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Clemens,
2001; Newton and Harte, 1997). Future research needs to
complement the internal inﬂuences with the role of social
and normative paradigms in the SMEs’ environmental
behaviour. We attempt in our study to minimize external
inﬂuences via homogeneity of the context of the sampled
organizations. Finally, we caution that our results do not
allow deﬁnitive statement about
the
causality in the analysed relationships and may have
limited generalizability due to the business and geographi-
cal peculiarities of our sample.

the direction of

Overall, our

study conﬁrms

that SMEs have an
important role to play in reducing the negative impacts
of business on the natural environment. Considering the
absolute impact of the SME sector on global economies,
more research attention should be paid to the environ-
mental practices of SMEs. Although previous research has
shown that larger ﬁrms are often environmentally more
proactive than smaller ones, paradoxically many of the
capabilities needed to develop proactive environmental
approaches may be fostered by certain strategic character-
istics of small ﬁrms. Future longitudinal work could
conﬁrm the direction of causality between capabilities,
environmental performance, and ﬁnancial performance.
Research comparing large and small ﬁrms can show that
SMEs may be at a resource disadvantage but not a
capability disadvantage when it comes to environmental
advances and this would have important implications for
policy makers and practitioners.
