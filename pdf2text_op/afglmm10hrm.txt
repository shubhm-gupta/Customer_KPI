This  article  demonstrates  that  a  diversity  and  equality  management  system 
(DEMS)  contributes  to  ﬁ rm  performance  beyond  the  effects  of  a  traditional 
high-performance  work  system  (HPWS),  which  consists  of  bundles  of  work 
practices and policies used extensively in high-performing ﬁ rms. A DEMS typi-
cally includes diversity training and monitoring recruitment, pay, and promo-
tion across minority or other disadvantaged groups. Our analysis of quantita-
tive data from service and manufacturing organizations in Ireland conﬁ rms that 
HPWS practices are associated with positive business performance and ﬁ nds 
speciﬁ cally  that  DEMS  practices  are  positively  associated  with  higher  labor 
productivity and workforce innovation and lower voluntary employee turnover.

Introduction

I  see  three  main  points  to  make 
the  business  case  for  diversity:  (1). 
a  talent  shortage  that  requires  us 
to  seek  out  and  use  the  full  ca-
pabilities  of  all  our  employees, 
(2). the  need  to  be  like  our  custom-
ers, including the need to understand 
and communicate with them in terms 
that reﬂ ect their concerns, (3). diverse 
teams produce better results. This last 
point is not so easy to sell as the ﬁ rst 
two—especially  to  engineers  who 

want the data. What I need is the data, 
the evidence that diverse groups do better 
(emphasis  added).—Lew  Platt,  former 
CEO of Hewlett, Packard, Comments to 
the Diversity Research Network, Stanford 
Business School, March 18, 1998

 In  organizations  today  considerable  em-

phasis  is  placed  on  facilitating  diversity 
and encouraging equality, assuming that, 
if properly embraced, diversity and equal-
ity  management  can  lead  to  improved 
firm performance (Jackson, Joshi, & Erhardt, 
2003; Thomas & Ely, 1996).

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010

Concrete evidence that demonstrates the 
bottom-line  effects  of  diversity  and  equality 
management, however, is much less evident, 
and, when tentative evidence has been found, 
it has tended to be context specific (e.g., Jack-
son & Joshi, 2004; Kochan et al., 
2003). What was initially termed 
“equal  opportunity”  began  as  an 
effort  to  meet  legislative  require-
ments  (Wilson,  1996).  In  many 
organizations, however, it has be-
come  a  strategic  priority  for  im-
proving  performance  (Carnevale 
&  Stone,  1994;  European  Com-
mission, 2005), despite little tan-
gible evidence showing that equal 
opportunity initiatives are an ap-
propriate  use  of  resources  (Char-
tered  Institute  of  Personnel  and 
Development (CIPD), 2006; Jayne 
& Dipboye, 2004).

Although many definitions of 
the term “diversity management” 
exist  (e.g.,  Ellis  &  Sonnenfield, 
1993; Kandola & Fullerton, 1994; 
Thomas & Ely, 1996), two are es-
pecially  helpful  in  capturing  the 
concept’s essence. The first states 
that diversity management is “an 
approach  to  workplace  equality 
[that]  draws  its  distinctiveness 
largely from its focus on equality 
through  ‘difference’  rather  than 
‘sameness’” (Gagnon & Cornelius, 
2002,  p.  36).  The  second  states 
that  managing  diversity  involves 
“understanding that there are dif-
ferences  among  employees  and 
that these differences, if properly 
managed,  are  an  asset  to  work 
being  done  more  efficiently  and 
effectively”  (Bartz,  Hillman,  Leh-
rer, & Mayhugh, 1990, p. 321).

For organizations 

to make informed 

decisions regarding 

the use of scarce 

resources 

to improve 

performance, 

they must be able 

to compare the 

effects of different 

potential initiatives. 

In this study, we 

demonstrate that 

investing in DEMS 

can contribute 

significantly to 

organizational 

performance.

Diversity  and  equality  man-
agement  systems  (DEMS)  may  be  composed 
of many facets, including written policies on 
diversity  and  equality  management,  diver-
sity/equality training for staff, and monitor-
ing recruitment, promotion, and relative pay 
by gender, age, and ethnic origin. In general, 
however, diversity and equality management 

systems provide challenges to the way people 
conceptualize  and  tackle  issues  that  are  re-
lated  to  equality,  sameness,  difference,  dis-
crimination,  and  injustice  in  employment. 
(For  an  in-depth  analysis  of  these  areas,  see 
Liff  &  Wajcman,  1996;  Noon  &  Ogbonna, 
2001.)

For organizations to make informed deci-
sions regarding the use of scarce resources to 
improve  performance,  they  must  be  able  to 
compare the effects of different potential ini-
tiatives.  In  this  study,  we  demonstrate  that 
investing  in  DEMS  can  contribute  signifi-
cantly  to  organizational  performance.  We 
also suggest that the traditional definition of 
HPWS should be expanded to include diver-
sity and equality management.

Theoretical Framework and 
Hypotheses
Expanding the Deﬁ nition of High 
Performance Work Systems

A  growing  body  of  research  has  suggested 
that using a package or system of HR prac-
tices that includes comprehensive employee 
recruitment and selection procedures, com-
pensation  and  performance  management, 
extensive  communication  and  employee 
involvement,  and  training  and  develop-
ment  can  improve  acquiring,  developing, 
and retaining a workforce that is a source of 
potential  competitive  advantage  (Datta, 
Guthrie,  &  Wright,  2005).  These  HR  prac-
tices  are  referred  to  as  high  involvement 
(Guthrie, 2001), high commitment (Arthur, 
1994),  or  high  performance  (Datta  et  al.; 
Huselid,  1995;  Pfeffer,  1995)  work  systems 
(HPWS).

Much of the analysis of HPWS originates 
from  the  study  of  strategic  human  resource 
management (hereafter strategic HRM), where 
researchers  have  examined  the  impact  of 
bundles  of  HR  practices  on  firm  outcomes 
such as productivity. The idea that a system 
of HR practices may be more than the sum of 
the parts has given rise to debate concerning 
the  specific  configuration  of  practices  that 
should constitute a high performance system.

THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE

Organization (ILO, 2006) suggested that high-
performing  workplaces  shared  five  main 
characteristics:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

People management: A focus on HR/
people issues, including fair and open 
recruitment, effective management, and 
well-established discipline and grievance 
procedures.
Employee involvement: A focus on em-
ployee involvement that encourages 
teamwork and developing responsibility, 
trust, and communication.
Training and development: A focus on 
continuously developing employees.
Diversity and equality: A commitment to 
equality and a diverse workforce by pro-
moting equal opportunity.
Work organization: A variety of working 
patterns, including flexible work arrange-
ments, work-life balance, family-friendly 
policies, and organizing work to match 
demand.

Despite  ILO’s  inclusion  of  diversity  and 
equality (characteristic 4, above), no research 
of  which  we  are  aware  has  investigated  the 
impact of diversity and equality management 
systems,  including  work  organization,  be-
yond the influence of traditional HPWS prac-
tices (captured in characteristics 1–3, above) 
on  firm  performance.  The  goal  of  this  re-
search is to address this gap.

The Effect of Traditional HPWS on 
Firm Performance
In  many  instances,  the  term  strategic  HRM  is 
used interchangeably with HPWS, and numer-
ous strategic HRM studies have examined the 
impact of bundles of HR practices on firm out-
comes (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993). According 
to  some  proponents,  however,  the  language 
used  in  relation  to  these  high-performing 
practices  differs  slightly  from  traditional  HR 
strategy  in  that  “these  practices  enable  and 
motivate workers to develop, share, and apply 
their knowledge and skills more fully than do 
traditional  practices,  with  positive  implica-
tions  for  the  quality  of  jobs  as  well  as  for 
performance” (Godard, 2004, p. 349).

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

Notably,  Huselid’s  (1995) 

landmark 
study  examined  the  relationship  between 
using  HPWS  and  firm  performance.  His 
main  finding  was  that  greater  use  of  HR 
practices  such  as  comprehensive  recruit-
ment  and  selection  and  extensive  training 
and  development  was  associated  with  de-
creased  rates  of  employee  turnover  and 
higher levels of productivity and profitabil-
ity. Since that seminal work was published, 
many  studies  have  found  a  positive  rela-
tionship between adopting specific bundles 
of HR practices and firm-level performance 
outcomes,  including  productivity  and  in-
novation  (Appelbaum,  Bailey,  Berg,  &  Kal-
leberg, 2000; Becker & Huselid, 1998; CIPD, 
2006; Datta et al., 2005; Flood, Guthrie, Liu, 
& MacCurtain, 2005; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 
1995; MacDuffie, 1995). Further supporting 
HPWS, Becker and Huselid (1998) stated:

 As ﬁ rms move away from centralized 
command  and  control  management 
structures,  HPWS  should  be  able  to 
provide a signiﬁ cant, and increasingly 
important,  source  of  value  creation. 
Within this context, a ﬁ rm’s workforce 
and its systems for managing people 
are seen as an investment rather than 
a cost to be minimized. (p. 92)

Clearly,  previous  studies  have  researched 
the  impact  of  HPWS  on  firm  performance  in 
depth. In light of our interest in highlighting 
the significant impact of DEMS over and above 
that  of  traditional  HPWS,  however,  we  must 
first ascertain the impact of HPWS on firm per-
formance  in  our  sample.  Guided  by  previous 
evidence, we test the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1: Increased use of high performance 
work systems results in increased labor produc-
tivity,  increased  workforce  innovation,  and  de-
creased voluntary employee turnover.

Adopting Diversity and Equality 
Management Systems

The question of distinguishing between em-
ployment  opportunity 
initiatives  and 
managing  diversity  is  an  interesting  one. 


980 

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010

Currently, managing 

diversity is enjoying 

a high profile in 

organizational 

debate, partly 

due to changes 

in workforce 

demographics, 

increased 

globalization, 

and changes in 

organizational 

structures.

Some  researchers  have  suggested  that  em-
ployment opportunity initiatives and manag-
ing diversity are at opposite ends of the same 
continuum and merely indicate a progression 
in developing equality in organizations (Mc-
Dougall, 1998), while others have suggested 
that  it  is  not  useful  to  distinguish  between 
them  (Malvin  &  Girling,  2000).  Currently, 
managing diversity is enjoying a high profile 
in  organizational  debate,  partly  due  to 
changes in workforce demographics, increased 
globalization,  and  changes  in  or-
ganizational  structures  (Cope  & 
Kalantzis, 1999). It is not possible, 
however,  to  separate  managing 
diversity  in  the  workplace  and 
providing equal employment op-
portunities  because  legislation 
supports  and  shapes  the  ways  in 
which  diversity 
is  managed 
(Monks, 2007).

Across  the  developed  world, 
significant  efforts  have  targeted 
making workforces more represen-
tative  of  the  general  population. 
In  Europe,  Article  13  of  the 
Amsterdam Treaty (1997) provides 
the European Union with power-
ful legal channels through which 
the  battle  against  discrimination 
and the support of equality in all 
arenas,  including  the  workplace, 
have  been  strengthened.  In  the 
United  States,  federal  legislation 
such as Title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act  (1964),  the  Age  Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act of 1967, and many 
state  laws  (which  often  go  further  than  fed-
eral laws) require firms to adopt specific tar-
gets for the composition of their workforces. 
In India, the Equal Remuneration Act (1976) 
enforces equal pay for men and women, and 
the  Persons  with  Disabilities  Act  (1995)  sets 
an employment target of 3% for persons with 
disabilities  in  government  organizations. 
India  has  also  adopted  some  stringent  affir-
mative action rules in an effort to undo dam-
age associated with the caste system. For ex-
ample, 22.5% of all government jobs, seats in 
state-sponsored educational institutions, and 
electoral  constituencies  are  reserved  for  per-

sons  who  belong  to  scheduled  castes  and 
tribes  and  are  considered  to  be  at  a  greater 
disadvantage than the general population. In 
China,  under  the  Employment  Promotion 
Law (2008) and earlier legislation, discrimina-
tion on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, and 
religion has been prohibited since 1995. Fur-
ther, discrimination against disabled persons 
has  been  prohibited  since  1991,  hepatitis  B 
carriers since 2007, and human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) carriers, acquired immuno-
deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  sufferers,  and 
their family members since 2006.

Ireland’s  workplace  equality  principles 
are founded in European legislation, such as 
the Amsterdam Treaty (1997). The Irish legis-
lation that ensures workplace equality derives 
mainly  from  the  Employment  Equality  Act 
(1998)  and  the  Equality  Act  (2004),  which 
forbid discrimination against employees and 
those seeking employment in relation to gen-
der,  age,  race,  religious  affiliation,  disability, 
marital  status,  family  status,  sexual  orienta-
tion,  and  membership  in  the  traveler  com-
munity  (an  indigenous  ethnic  Irish  group). 
People  cannot  be  treated  less  favorably  on 
the basis of any of these criteria in relation to 
dismissal, pay, harassment and sexual harass-
ment, working conditions, promotion, access 
to employment, and several other areas.

Business Beneﬁ ts and Challenges of 
Diversity and Equality Management
While  considerable  research  on  diversity 
has  been  undertaken  since  the  mid-1990s, 
relatively little hard data supports the claim 
that diversity and equality initiatives influ-
ence  firm  performance  (Monks,  2007).  In 
general,  studies  that  have  examined  firm 
performance  have  usually  used  financial 
indicators  such  as  return  on  investment, 
revenue,  costs,  and  profits  (Jayne  &  Dip-
boye,  2004).  Organizations  frequently  pro-
tect such hard data because it is potentially 
commercially  sensitive  (Monks).  Several 
qualitative studies have shown broadly pos-
itive  results,  but  the  ability  to  translate 
equality and diversity policies into improved 
performance 
is  highly  context-specific 
(Jayne  &  Dipboye;  Kochan  et  al.,  2003;

Triandis, 1995; Yasbek, 2004), and the results 
are seldom readily generalizable.

Thus,  an  obvious  question  is,  Why  do 
we expect DEMS to result in improved or-
ganizational  performance?  Theoretical 
support  for  the  idea  comes  from  Appel-
baum et al.’s (2000) AMO theory of perfor-
mance, which states that performance is a 
function  of  employee  ability,  motivation, 
and opportunity. In applying AMO theory 
to the context of the current study, there-
fore,  we  argue  that  performance  depends 
on  a  workforce  that  is  (1)  competent  and 
able (through both non-discriminatory re-
cruiting  and  training  and  development 
practices), that is (2) motivated (meaningful 
work  combined  with  a  sense  of  workplace 
justice), and that has (3) opportunities (em-
ployee  involvement  practices  that  provide 
employees with the opportunity to contrib-
ute within the firm). If a diverse workforce is 
managed effectively (e.g., provided with rel-
evant  training  and  development  and  high 
levels  of  involvement),  its  contribution  to 
the organization will be greater. While most 
of the diversity literature has focused on the 
relationship between diversity and individual 
and team outcomes, focus has increased on 
managing  diversity  and  its  impact  at  the 
firm  level  (Richard,  2000).  Moss-Kanter 
(1983)  noted  that  com   panies  that  effectively 
managed diversity had higher levels of inno-
vation,  specifically  noting  that  these  compa-
nies  performed  better  than  most  in  eradicat-
ing  racism  and  sexism  and  employing  a 
diverse workforce. In a study of the effects of 
racial diversity in the banking industry, Rich-
ard    found  that  effectively  managed  cultural 
diversity  contributed  to  firm  competitive 
advantage. Cox and Blake (1991) argued that 
the effective management of diversity can cre-
ate  a  competitive  advantage  that  focuses  on 
cost, attracting high-caliber employees, creativity 
and innovation, market success, and organiza-
tional  flexibility.  While  limited  evidence  ex-
plicitly  demonstrates  a  relationship  between 
managing  diversity  and  firm-level  outcomes, 
evidence exists that the failure to manage di-
versity  effectively  can  adversely  affect  the 
firm’s  competitive  advantage.  For  example, 
studies  of  male  and  female  managers  in  the 

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

United States found links between ineffective 
(gender) diversity management and turnover 
(Schwartz, 1989).

Recently,  the  European  Commission 
investigated the use of diversity and equality 
procedures  and  policies 
in  European 
companies  and  the  business  case  for  such 
policies.  Their  results  indicated  that  48% 
of  responding  companies  were  engaged 
actively  in  promoting  workplace  diversity 
and an anti-discrimination agenda (European 
Commission,  2005).  The  prac-
tices  associated  with  this  active 
engagement  included  initiatives 
such  as  monitoring  and  regular 
reporting of diversity targets and 
strong management accountabil-
ity  for  diversity  and  equality 
management. 
Eighty-three 
percent  of  the  companies  that 
adopted such an agenda reported 
that  it  made  sound  business 
sense.  Diversity  within  work 
groups and teams has been shown 
to bring its own rewards, includ-
ing  a  healthy  return  on  invest-
ment 
capital 
(Gardenswartz  &  Rowe,  1998). 
Specifically,  the  European  Com-
mission  study  and  others  have 
reported  that  the  main  business 
benefits  of  focusing  on  diversity 
are  the  ability  to  recruit  from  a 
wider selection of people and re-
tain  better  workers  for  longer 
(Iles,  1995;  McKay  et  al.,  2007; 
Ross & Schneider, 1992), broader 
market  intelligence  and  interna-
tionalization 
(Cox  &  Blake, 
1991),  greater  creativity  and  in-
novation (Gardenswartz & Rowe, 
1998; Iles, 1995; West & Anderson, 
1998;  Wilson,  1996),  diverse  perspectives 
on  business  issues  and  improved  problem 
solving  and  decision  making  (Adler,  1997; 
Flood,  MacCurtain,  &  West,  2001),  im-
proved  marketing  (Metcalf  &  Forth,  2000), 
improved  community  relations  and  an  en-
hanced  company  image  (Nykiel,  1997), 
reduced costs linked to turnover and absen-
teeism  (Kandola,  1995;  Ross  &  Schneider,

1992), and increased resilience and flexibil-
ity (Gardenswartz & Rowe).

Recently, the 

European 

Commission 

investigated the 

use of diversity 

and equality 

procedures and 

Many of these firm-level benefits may ac-
crue from the benefits that employees derive 
from DEMS (including work orga-
nization),  such  as  reduced  work-
related  stress,  increased  job  satis-
faction  (O’Connell  &  Russell, 
2005),  and  an  increased  sense  of 
fairness  in  the  workplace  (Siegel, 
Post,  Garden,  Brockner,  & 
Fishman, 2005). According to Sie-
gel  et  al.,  employees’  belief  that 
the firm treats them fairly can in-
fluence a number of attitudes and 
behaviors  of  organizational  rele-
vance,  such  as  commitment 
(Brockner,  Siegel,  Daly,  Tyler,  & 
Martin, 1997) and trust (Konovsky 
&  Pugh,  1994).  In  addition,  the 
greater  the  degree  to  which  em-
ployees perceive that their firm is 
providing  them  with  a  working 
environment  where  social  bene-
fits and a sense of fairness are im-
portant  values,  the  more  moti-
vated they will be to reward their 
firm  with  discretionary  effort 
(Lambert, 2000).

Despite  some  evidence  of  the 
benefits of increasing diversity and 
equality  in  workplaces,  findings 
across  studies  have  been  mixed. 
For example, studies of gender di-
versity  have  found  that  its  effects 
on  performance  are  sometimes 
positive  (Jackson  &  Joshi,  2004; 
Kochan et al., 2003; Rentsch & Kli-
moski, 2001; Yasbek, 2004), some-
times negative (Jehn & Bezrukova, 
2003), and sometimes insignificant 
(Richard,  2000;  Watson,  Johnson, 
Kumar, & Critelli, 1998). This trend 
has  been  mirrored  in  racial  diver-
sity  (see  Williams  &  O’Reilly,  1998,  for  a  re-
view).  Some  researchers  have  suggested  that 
creating  a  diverse  organization  but  failing  to 
manage  that  diversity  effectively  can  lead  to 
negative outcomes such as a lack of consensus 
and dysfunctional conflict (Riordan, 2000; Ste-
phenson & Lewin, 1996; Williams & O’Reilly, 

policies in European 

companies and 

the business case 

for such policies. 

Their results 

indicated that 

48% of responding 

companies were 

engaged actively 

in promoting 

workplace diversity 

and an anti-

discrimination 

agenda (European 

Commission, 2005).

1998).  Recognizing  that  diverse  work  groups 
sometimes  do  not  reach  their  full  potential, 
Jehn and Bezrukova (2003) and Kochan et al. 
(2003) highlighted that while diversity may be 
beneficial,  diversity  and  equality  initiatives 
must  be  managed  effectively  to  realize  these 
benefits.  It  could  be  argued,  then,  that  effec-
tively managing diversity and equality systems 
can help achieve the business benefits of diver-
sity (e.g., effective problem solving and inno-
vation)  without  triggering  the  negative 
outcomes of diversity (e.g., dysfunctional con-
flict).  Such  effective  management  initiatives 
could  include  maintaining  top  management 
support,  incorporating  diversity  and  equality 
in  the  organization’s  mission  and  vision 
(including diversity and equality in setting ob-
jectives  and  reward  and  recognition),  provid-
ing  training  related  to  diversity  and  equality 
across all levels in the firm, and measuring the 
impact  of  diversity  and  equality  within  the 
firm (Monks, 2007).

Quantifying the Beneﬁ ts of a Diverse 
Workforce

Some  firms  have  difficulty  assessing  the  net 
impact of equality and diversity policies; after 
all, it is far easier to identify and measure tan-
gible costs than benefits that by their nature 
tend  to  yield  rewards  in  the  longer  term.  In 
this  study,  however,  we  attempt  to  examine 
quantitatively the business benefits of manag-
ing diversity and equality effectively. Specifi-
cally,  we  examine  the  effects  of  HPWS  and 
DEMS on labor productivity, workforce inno-
vation, and employee turnover. Following the 
lead  of  other  studies  (e.g.,  Guthrie,  2001; 
Huselid,  1995),  we  define  labor  productivity 
as sales revenue per employee; measure work-
force  innovation  as  sales  revenue  generated 
from  newly  introduced  products  (again  per 
employee);  and  measure  employee  turnover 
as the firm’s annual voluntary turnover rate.

Successful diversity and equality initiatives 
do not normally exist as stand-alone entities, 
but  as  a  component  of  an  integrated  human 
resource management system (Benschop, 2001; 
Monks,  2007).  It  is  imperative,  therefore,  to 
account for other aspects of the HRM system 
that  could  also  account  for  improvements  in

performance.  Thus,  we  isolate  the  effects  of 
DEMS over and above performance enhance-
ments associated with other high performance 
HR practices. More formally:

Hypothesis 2: Increased use of diversity/equality 
management  systems  results  in  increased  labor 
productivity, workforce innovation, and decreased 
voluntary employee turnover, over and above the 
contribution of high performance work systems.

Study Context: The Irish Labor Market

The labor market in the Republic of Ireland is 
the setting for our study. The country’s legis-
latives  efforts  and  Ireland’s  robust  “Celtic 
tiger” economy during the 1990s and 2000s 
have  caused  Ireland’s  workforce  to  become 
significantly more diverse in terms of nation-
ality, language, ethnicity, and religious affili-
ation.  This  increased  diversity  was  mainly 
due to the population’s share of non-Irish im-
migrants increasing from 3% in 1993 to 10% 
in  2006  (Smyth,  Darmody,  McGinnity,  & 
Byrne, 2009). In addition, the rates of females 
participating in the workforce increased from 
42% in 1990 to almost 58% in 2003 (Central 
Statistics Office [CSO], 2003). The proportion 
of  older  people  in  the  Irish  population  has 
also risen. It is expected that the proportion 
of those aged between 45 and 64 years in the 
labor  force  will  continue  to  rise.  The  rising 
average  age  among  workers  will  create  both 
opportunities  and  challenges  for  employers, 
bringing  an  increased  availability  of  labor, 
but  also  the  need  to  provide  more  flexible 
working  arrangements  (Equality  Authority, 
2002a).  Additional  participation  is  also  ex-
pected  from  those  with  disabilities,  as  they 
remain a relatively untapped potential labor 
pool (Gannon & Nolan, 2004). Religious di-
versity is increasing in line with immigration, 
and  citizens  are  also  changing  their  aware-
ness of sexual diversity, particularly following 
provisions for civil partnership in many Eu-
ropean countries, including Ireland. Research 
on employing gay and lesbian people, how-
ever, indicates that they may still experience 
hostility  and  discrimination  at  work  (Equal-
ity Authority, 2002b; Zappone, 2003).

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

Effectively managing 

diversity and 

equality systems 

can help achieve 

the business 

benefits of diversity 

(e.g., effective 

problem solving and 

innovation) without 

triggering the 

negative outcomes 

of diversity (e.g., 

dysfunctional 

conflict).

Since 2007, statistics on labor market sup-
ply have shown some decline in immigrants 
due to the current world economic crisis. The 
Irish  economy  is  experiencing  a  decline  in 
the  number  of  migrant  inflows, 
and  the  ability  of  the  Irish  econ-
omy to absorb the migrant inflow 
has  also  decreased.  Nonetheless, 
in the third quarter of 2008, non-
Irish  people  still  accounted  for 
80%  of  the  year-on-year  increase 
in  the  size  of  the  labor  force 
(22,000),  which  at  that  time  was 
2.24 million (Foras Áiseanna Sao-
thair [FAS], 2008). Thus, the Irish 
economy still provides a rich con-
text for a study of diversity that is 
not  limited  to  diversity  based 
solely  on  nationality  but  also  in-
cludes gender, disability, age, and 
religious background.

 In some countries, workforce 
diversity has been a fact of life for 
many  years,  but  until  the  late 
1990s, Ireland had a relatively ho-
mogeneous  workforce.  As  the 
workforce  has  become  more  di-
verse, many indigenous and mul-
tinational  organizations  based  in 
Ireland have struggled to manage 
their  newly  culturally  diverse  workforces  ef-
fectively.  This  challenge  is  experienced  not 
only by companies operating in Ireland, how-
ever.  As  evidenced  by  research  worldwide, 
many organizations experience difficulties in 
harnessing the positive effects of employing a 
diverse  workforce  (Cope  &  Kalantzis,  1999). 
This  study,  therefore,  aims  to  examine  the 
extent  to  which  diversity  and  equality  are 
managed actively to address issues of equality, 
discrimination, and injustice in employment 
(Noon  &  Ogbonna,  2001)  and  the  extent  to 
which diversity and equality issues are impor-
tant in enhancing business performance (Ko-
chan et al., 2003).

Method

The  quantitative  approach  adopted  here 
draws on the work of other researchers in this 
area  (Datta  et  al.,  2005;  Flood  et  al.,  2005; 


984 

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010

Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995). The procedure 
was  to  solicit  survey-based  descriptions  of 
management  practices  in  the  areas  of  com-
munication  and  participation,  training  and 
development,  staffing  and  recruitment, 
performance management and remuneration, 
and equality and diversity management, and 
to  match  these  with  indices  of  firm  perfor-
mance.  To  achieve  this  objective,  two  sepa-
rate  survey  instruments  focusing  on  general 
management  practices  and  human  resource 
practices were sent to the managing director 
(MD) and to the senior HR manager, respec-
tively,  of  identified  firms.  The  general  man-
agement practices survey obtained measures 
on  a  variety  of  firm  characteristics.  In  addi-
tion  to  repeating  some  of  these  same  mea-
sures (to assess measurement reliability), the 
HR  practices  survey  asked  respondents  to 
“describe HR practices in your operations in 
Ireland during 2005–06.” After pilot testing, 
surveys were mailed to executives identified 
in sample firms, followed by reminder letters 
and a second copy of the survey.

Sample

The  study,  designed  according  to  the  total 
design  method  (Dillman,  2000),  was  exe-
cuted from May to October 2006. The sam-
ple of 1,000 firms was drawn from the Irish 
Times Top 1000 Companies database, which 
includes a representative, multi-industry set 
of  Irish-based  operations.  The  sample 
included  both  indigenous  Irish  firms  and 
foreign-owned firms with operations in Ire-
land.  In  total,  241  companies  participated; 
132 of them completed both surveys (which 
was necessary for a reliable result), resulting 
in an overall usable response rate of 13.2%. 
This response rate is in line with typical re-
sponse  rates  for  research  of  this  nature, 
which  range  from  6%  to  28%  (Becker  & 
Huselid,  1998).  This  is  especially  typical 
given that only matched pairs are included 
in our response rate.

The  threat  of  non-response  bias  exists 
whenever  significant  numbers  of  the  tar-
geted population fail to respond. Given the 
relatively low response rate, we checked for 
possible  non-response  bias  using  a  time 

trend extrapolation test in which we com-
pared  late  versus  early  respondents  along 
key study variables. The assumption behind 
this test is that late respondents (responses 
were  received  after  the  second  round  of 
mailing and follow-up telephone calls) are 
similar  to  non-respondents  (Armstrong  & 
Overton,  1977).  T-tests  conducted  showed 
no  significant  differences  between  early 
and late respondents along any of the key 
study  variables.  In  addition,  we  compared 
responding  versus  non-responding  firms 
using limited data available from the 2005 
version of the Irish Times Top 1000 Compa-
nies.  Specifically,  we  used  these  data  to 
compare  respondents  to  non-respondents 
in terms of company size and industry dis-
tribution.  Using  a  one-way  ANOVA  proce-
dure,  we  compared  the  respondents  with 
the  Top  1000  firms  and  found  no  signifi-
cant  differences  with  regard  to  company 
size  or  industry.  While  these  comparisons 
do  not  rule  out  systematic  non-response 
bias, they do increase confidence that non-
response bias does not threaten the validity 
of our results.

Responding firms represented a variety of 
industries, including transportation and com-
munications  (7%);  financial  services  (10%); 
chemical  products  (5%);  retail/wholesale 
(14%);  agriculture,  energy,  or  construction 
(16%);  service  (13%);  and  manufacturing 
(35%). Of the organizations that responded, 
50%  (n  ⫽  66)  were  subsidiaries  of  foreign 
companies, including those from the United 
States (26%, n ⫽ 34), Germany (7%, n ⫽ 9), 
and  the  United  Kingdom  (5%,  n  ⫽  7).  The 
remaining  50%  were  wholly  Irish-owned 
organizations.  The  average  firm  had  been 
established for about 37 years, and the median 
number of employees was 270.

Measures

Data regarding HPWS and diversity/equality 
systems were obtained from the HR practices 
survey. Data used to compute workforce pro-
ductivity  (sales  revenue  and  number  of 
employees)  and  innovation  outcome  mea-
sures (percent of sales derived from recently 
introduced  products  and  services)  were

obtained from both the HR practices survey 
and the GM practices survey, as well as from 
publicly  available  sales  revenue  figures.  As 
has been done in other work (e.g., Guthrie, 
2001;  Huselid,  1995),  voluntary  turnover 
was  obtained  from  the  HR  practices  survey 
respondents.

High Performance Work Systems

Explicitly based upon the study of Datta et al. 
(2005),  we  used  18  HR  practices  from  the 
areas  of  staffing,  performance  management, 
and  remuneration;  training  and  develop-
ment;  and  communication  and  employee 
involvement  to  form  a  single  index  repre-
senting a measure of HPWS. Because practices 
tend  to  vary  across  employee  groups,  ques-
tions related to HR practices were asked sepa-
rately for two categories of employees: Group 
A was composed of production, maintenance, 
service,  and  clerical  employees  (sometimes 
called “non-exempt” employees), and Group 
B was composed of executives, managers, su-
pervisors, and professional/technical employ-
ees (sometimes called “exempt” employees). 
This categorization scheme was derived from 
the  groupings  used  by  Huselid  (1995)  and 
Datta et al.  Sample items are “What propor-
tion of your employees from Groups A and B 
are  administered  one  or  more  employment 
tests (e.g., skills tests, aptitude tests, or men-
tal/cognitive  ability  tests)  prior  to  hiring?” 
“What  proportion  of  your  employees  from 
Groups  A  and  B  have  received  intensive/ex-
tensive  training 
in  generic  skills  (e.g., 
problem-solving,  communication 
skills, 
etc.)?” “What proportion of your employees 
from Groups A and B receive compensation 
partially  contingent  on  group  performance 
(e.g.,  profit-sharing,  gain-sharing,  team-
based)?” See Appendix A for a full list of the 
18  HR  practices.  Using  the  number  of  em-
ployees  in  each  occupational  group,  a 
weighted average for each practice was com-
puted. To illustrate, assume a particular com-
pany  has  500  Group  A  employees  and  100 
Group B employees and that 20% of Group A 
employees  and  40%  of  Group  B  employees 
“receive formal performance appraisals on a 
routine basis.” The weighted average for this 

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

HR practice would be [(500*20) + (100*40)]/600 
⫽ 23.33. This averaging technique was applied 
to  each  of  the  18  HR  practices.  These  18 
weighted averages were then used to form a 
composite  scale.  The  Cronbach’s  alpha  for 
the computed scale was .854.

Diversity/Equality Management Practices

Questions  related  to  diversity  and  equality 
management  practices  (n  ⫽  17)  focused  on 
policies  and  monitoring  practices.  Sample 
items are “What proportion of your total em-
ployees receives equality/diversity training?” 
“To what extent is equality and diversity in-
tegrated  into  overall  corporate  strategy?” 
“Does  this  workplace  have  a  formal  written 
policy  on  managing  diversity?”  “Do  you 
monitor  recruitment  and  selection  by  gen-
der?” See Appendix B for a listing of all items. 
Because the scales associated with the items 
varied, they were standardized to a common 
scale using a z-score transformation.

These measures were original to this study; 
therefore,  we  conducted  exploratory  factor 
analysis. Johnson and Wichern (1982) recom-
mended  validating  factor  solutions  by  com-
paring  the  consistency  of  results  yielded  by 
alternative extraction methods. The principal 
components (PC) and principal axis factoring 
(PAF) techniques yielded parallel results: four 
factors with very similar factor structures. Fac-
tor 1 was composed of the four “recruitment 
and selection” monitoring items; factor 2 was 
composed of the four “promotions” monitor-
ing items; factor 3 was composed of the four 
“pay rate” monitoring items; and factor 4 was 
composed  of  the  remaining  five  items.  See 
Appendix B for a full list of the diversity and 
equality management items.

Using  the  factor  results  as  a  guide,  we 
created four composite scales, among which 
intercorrelations  were  fairly  high  (average 
r  >  .40).  Given  these  intercorrelations  and 
the  present  study’s  focus  (which  is  not  on 
the dimensionality of diversity management, 
per  se),  a  second-order  factor  analysis 
was  performed  to  determine  whether  the 
four  primary  factors  would  converge  into  a 
single, higher-order factor. Higher-order fac-
tor analysis identifies areas of generalization 


986 

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010

across primary factors; that is, if primary fac-
tors  (i.e.,  first-order)  are  correlated,  then 
these  correlations  give  rise  to  second-order 
factors.  Higher-order  analyses  can  continue 
until  only  one  factor  is  produced  or  until 
uncorrelated  factors  occur  (Gorsuch,  1983). 
Our  assumption  is  that  our  four  primary 
factors  are  intercorrelated  because  they  are 
influenced  by  a  broader  underlying  con-
struct.  The  secondary  factor  analysis  results 
were consistent with this assumption: a sin-
gle factor was extracted. Accordingly, a single 
diversity/equality management scale was cre-
ated  for  each  responding  firm.  Further  evi-
dence for the interrelatedness of these items 
is  the  high  Cronbach’s  alpha  (.851).  Cron-
bach’s alpha, which is mathematically equiv-
alent to the average of all possible split-half 
estimates,  will  take  on  a  high  value  when 
items  have  significant  shared  variance,  that 
is, high intercorrelations.

Labor Productivity

As  per  other  studies  (e.g.,  Guthrie,  2001; 
Huselid,  1995),  labor  productivity  was  mea-
sured  as  revenue  created  per  employee.  Data 
on the most recent estimates of total sales and 
total employment were collected via question-
naires  from  both  respondent  groups.  Labor 
productivity was calculated as total firm reve-
nue divided by the total number of employees. 
The  computed  intra-class  correlation  coeffi-
⫽ .830) supports the reliability of 
cient (ICC2 
these data. Because our primary independent 
variables were obtained from the HR practices 
surveys,  we  reduced  the  threat  of  common 
method  bias  by  using  the  GM  practices  sur-
vey’s  labor  productivity  components.  A  log 
transformation corrected for data skewness.

enue  generated  by  selling  new  products  or 
services. This sales figure was then divided by 
the number of employees to obtain our mea-
sure  of  workforce  innovation,  an  indication 
of  per-capita  sales  derived  from  recently  in-
troduced  products  or  services.  This  measure 
captures  a  workforce’s  ability  to  impact 
organizational  efficiency  and  innovation 
through  process  and  product  innovations. 
These  estimates  were  provided  by  respon-
dents from both the HR practices survey and 
the  GM  practices  survey.  The  ICC2  value 
(.961)  supported  the  reliability  of  these  re-
sponses. As above, we used the GM practices 
survey respondents’ data to reduce the threat 
of same-source bias and a log transformation 
to correct for data skewness.

Employee Turnover

In  this  research,  the  measure  of  a  firm’s 
employee  turnover  rates  was  taken  from 
responses  to  the  following  survey  prompt 
on the HR practices survey: “Please estimate 
your  annual  voluntary  employee  turnover 
rate  (percentage  who  voluntarily  departed 
your  organization).”  This  question  was 
asked  separately  for  both  categories  of 
employees  (Group  A  and  Group  B).  A 
weighted average of these separate estimates 
was computed to represent the overall aver-
age rate of employee turnover for each firm, 
and  values  were  log-transformed  to  correct 
for skewness.1

Control Variables

We used a number of control variables in our 
ordinary 
least  squares  (OLS)  regression 
models:

Workforce Innovation

Workforce  innovation  was  quantified  using 
the data on number of employees, sales rev-
enue,  and  the  response  to  the  question 
“What  proportion  of  your  firm’s  total  sales 
(turnover)  comes  from  products  or  services 
introduced within the previous 12 months?” 
The response to this question was multiplied 
by total sales to yield an estimate of sales rev-

Firm age: The measure of firm age is 
taken from the question “How long has 
your local organization been in opera-
tion?” Reliability statistics supported ag-
gregation (ICC2 ⫽ .905), and we used a 
log transformation of the mean of both 
groups’ responses.
Firm size: Number of employees is 
used to indicate firm size. To calculate 
firm size, we used a log transforma-

tion of the mean of both respondent 
groups’ responses (ICC2 ⫽ .933).
R&D investment as a percentage of sales 
revenue: We used the average of the two 
respondents (ICC2 ⫽ .803).
Unionization: This measure is taken 
from the question on the HR survey 
“What proportion of your workforce is 
unionized?” A weighted average of Group 
A and Group B was used to compute the 
overall level of unionization.
Product differentiation strategy: This mea-
sure is taken from the GM practices survey 
question “During 2005–06, what propor-
tion of your organisation’s total sales 
(turnover) was achieved through a product 
differentiation strategy?” The log of this 
response was used due to skewness.
Country of ownership: Firms were clas-
sified as Irish indigenous (1) or foreign-
owned (0).
Industry sector: Firms were dummy-
coded to indicate their membership 
in one of seven industries: agriculture, 
chemicals, manufacturing, retail, ser-
vices, transportation/communication, 
or financial. The average firm derived 
approximately 94% of its sales from its 
designated primary industry. This lack 
of diversification supports designating a 
primary industry for sample firms. In the 
OLS analyses, “financial” is the omitted 
benchmark industry variable.

Results
Table  I  presents  the  means,  standard  devia-
tions,  correlations,  and  reliability  levels  for 
the study’s multiple-item indices. Both of the 
index reliabilities, as measured by Cronbach’s 
alpha,  exceeded  the  cutoff  of  0.70  for  scale 
development suggested by Nunnally (1978).

We  used  OLS  regression  analysis  as  the 
primary  test  of  our  research  questions. 
Regression  results  are  presented  in  Table  II. 
Overall, our models accounted for 33.8% of 
variance in productivity (F ⫽ 5.14; p < .001), 
24.7%  of  variance  in  workforce  innovation 
(F ⫽ 3.32; p < .001), and 36.7% of variance in 
voluntary turnover rates (F ⫽ 4.23; p < .001). 
Models 1, 3, and 5 include the set of control

variables  (firm  origin,  industry  sector,  firm 
age, number of employees, level of unioniza-
tion,  R&D  investment,  product  differentia-
tion  strategy)  and  the  HPWS  scale.  These 
models also indicate the proportion of vari-
ance  associated  with  the  addition  of  the 
HPWS  variable.  Consistent  with  previous 
research,  using  HPWS  significantly  predicts 
firm  outcomes;  in  this  case,  the 
practices  of  labor  productivity, 
workforce innovation, and volun-
tary 
firm 
outcomes—all  in  the  expected 
direction.  The  effect  of  HPWS  is 
strongest in relation to labor pro-
ductivity,  where  it  accounts  for 
11.2% of variance (p < 0.001) over 
and  above  the  effect  of  the  con-
trol variables. In relation to work-
force  innovation  and  voluntary 
turnover,  HPWS  accounts  for 
6.6% (p < 0.01) and 5.5% (p < 0.01) 
of  variance,  respectively.  These 
results  support  Hypothesis  1, 
which  predicted  that  increased 
use  of  HPWS  would  result  in 
increased 
labor  productivity, 
increased  workforce  innovation, 
and decreased voluntary employee 
turnover.

Models  2,  4,  and  6  illustrate 
the effect of adding DEMS to the 
equations.  The  analysis  shows 
that greater use of DEMS is asso-
ciated  with  significantly  higher  labor  pro-
ductivity  over  and  above  the  effects  of 
HPWS,  accounting  for  2%  unique  variance 
(p  <  0.05).  Analyses  also  show  that  greater 
use of DEMS is associated with significantly 
higher  levels  of  workforce  innovation  over 
and above the effects of HPWS. Specifically, 
DEMS  accounted  for  2.2%  unique  variance 
(p < 0.05). Finally, greater use of DEMS is as-
sociated  with  significantly  lower  voluntary 
labor turnover, over and above the effects of 
HPWS, accounting for 2.5% unique variance 
(p < 0.05). These results support Hypothesis 
2, which predicted that increased use of di-
versity/equality management systems would 
result  in  increased  labor  productivity  and 
workforce 
innovation  and  decreased

Supplemental Analyses

Introducing our measure of diversity/equality 
reduced  the  effect  of  our  HPWS  measure 
on  the  outcome  variables,  suggesting  the 
possibility  that  DEMS  mediates  the  relation-
ship  between  HPWS  and  our  outcome  mea-
sures.2 According to Baron and Kenny (1986):

A  variable  functions  as  a  mediator 
when  it  meets  the  following  condi-
tions:  (a)  variations  in  levels  of  the 
independent  variable 
signiﬁ cantly 
account for variations in the presumed 
mediator (i.e., Path a), (b) variations in 
the mediator signiﬁ cantly account for 

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

variations  in  the  dependent  variable 
(i.e., Path b), and (c) when Paths a and 
b  are  controlled,  a  previously  signiﬁ -
cant relation between the independent 
and dependent variables is no longer 
signiﬁ cant, with the strongest demon-
stration of mediation occurring when 
Path c is reduced to zero. (p. 1176)

Following Baron and Kenny’s (1986) rec-
ommendation, we ran a series of OLS regres-
sions to examine whether the DEMS variable 
mediates the effect of HPWS on our outcome 
measures.  To  establish  Path  a,  we  first  re-
gressed  our  DEMS  measure  on  HPWS,  along 
with  the  same  set  of  controls  used  in  our 
models. Consistent with the correlation results 
(where  DEMS  and  HPWS  correlate  at 
r  ⫽  .381,  p  <  .001),  the  OLS  results  reveal  a 


990 

HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010

significant  association  (b  ⫽  .428,  p  <  .001). 
Paths b and c are obtained from Models 1–6. 
In  all  cases,  the  path  between  the  potential 
mediator (DEMS) and the outcome variables 
is  significant  (i.e.,  Path  b),  and  the  effect  of 
HPWS on these outcome variables 
(Path  c)  is  reduced.  A  formal  test 
provides support for a partial me-
diating  role  for  DEMS  in  the 
HPWS-productivity  relationship 
(Sobel  test  statistic  ⫽  1.602;  p  < 
.10, one-tailed). We used Models 3 
and 4 to perform a similar test for 
the  innovation  outcome  measure 
and  found  modest  support  for  a 
mediating  role  for  DEMS  in  this 
relationship (Sobel test statistic ⫽ 
1.557;  p  <  .10,  one-tailed).  Using 
Models  5  and  6,  we  again  found 
support  for  DEMS  partially  medi-
ating  the  impact  of  HPWS  on 
voluntary turnover (Sobel test sta-
tistic ⫽ 1.800; p < .05, one-tailed).

and firms that

gains.

Discussion

Our  study  reveals  that  increased 
use of inclusive high performance 
work systems (meaning a combination of tra-
ditional  HPWS  and  diversity  and  equality 
management systems) led to very real benefits 
for both employers and employees in the or-
ganizations  that  composed  this  study’s  sam-
ple.  Consistent  with  previous  research  (e.g., 
Datta  et  al.,  2005;  Guthrie,  2001;  Huselid, 
1995;  Way,  2002),  the  organizations  in  our 
sample that used higher levels of HPWS real-
ized higher performance, and firms that em-
phasized  diversity/equality  management  in 
addition to HPWS achieved even more gains. 
Specifically, similarly to Jackson et al. (2003), 
Kochan  et  al.  (2003),  and  Thomas  and  Ely 
(1996),  our  analyses  indicate  that  firms  that 
use DEMS demonstrate higher levels of labor 
productivity, increased workforce innovation, 
and decreased voluntary turnover. Moreover, 
these effects are evident over and above those 
associated  with  HPWS.  When  firms  used 
HPWS  and  DEMS  in  tandem,  the  combina-
tion explained 13.2% of the variance in labor 
productivity,  8.8%  of  the  variation  in  work-

force innovation, and 8% of the variance in 
voluntary  employee  turnover.  Although  the 
effect sizes in relation to DEMS alone appear 
to be relatively small, when they are consid-
ered in relation to the numbers of employees 
and  annual  sales  turnover  of  these  firms,  in 
many cases the monetary effect is quite large. 
Using  our  OLS  models,  we  estimate  that 
increasing  DEMS  from  “average”  to  “above 
average”  (one  standard  deviation  above  the 
mean) will, for the typical firm in our sample, 
 60,420. 
increase  sales  per  employee  by 
Moreover, while the association with increases 
in labor productivity is important and signifi-
cant, the increase in per-capita sales from new 
products and services is particularly meaning-
ful. This is because the future of organizations 
depends on their ability to innovate and pro-
duce  new  products  that  will  generate  future 
sales.  It  is  also  important  not  to  underesti-
mate  the  financial  implications  of  reducing 
voluntary  employee  turnover.  Evidence  has 
suggested  a  consistent  association  between 
employee  retention  and  firm  success  (Shaw, 
Gupta, & Delery, 2005).

This study’s findings are important for sev-
eral  reasons.  First,  although  the  diversity 
imperative is widely discussed in the literature, 
the empirical evidence in reality has suggested 
that  diverse  groups  often  do  not  reach  their 
full potential (Jehn & Bezrukova, 2003; Kochan 
et  al.,  2003).  Our  findings  provide  empirical 
evidence that effective diversity/equality man-
agement  can  lead  to  measurable  monetary 
benefits at the firm level. This would suggest 
that  despite  some  concern  expressed  (CIPD, 
2006; Jayne & Dipboye, 2004), investing in a 
well-constructed  and  supported  DEMS  is  an 
appropriate  use  of  resources.  This  finding  is 
significant  in  that  developing  a  compelling 
business  case  tends  to  lead  to  diffusing  such 
practices  throughout  the  organization  more 
quickly (Flood, Ramamoorthy, & Liu, 2003).

Second, our findings enhance our under-
standing of what factors are important in de-
veloping  an  effective  DEMS.  Organizations 
that manage diversity actively in a fair and ef-
fective  way  (e.g.,  have  a  diversity  champion 
within the organization, provide training, in-
corporate diversity management in the firm’s 
overall strategy, and have promotional tracking

of  all  groups  in  the  organization)  are  more 
likely to achieve positive outcomes. Much of 
the  literature  on  diversity  has  indicated  that 
diverse  groups  are  more  innovative  because 
factors such as diverse perspectives and diverse 
information  sources  can  enhance  creativity, 
innovative  behavior,  and  decision  making 
(Adler,  1997;  European  Commission,  2005; 
Flood et al., 2001; Metcalf & Forth, 2000). This 
literature, however, has also indicated that di-
versity may also negatively impact employee 
attitude, because some diverse groups may be 
less  cohesive  and  more  prone  to  conflict 
(Stephenson  &  Lewin,  1996).  Our  findings, 
which suggest that organizations that manage 
diversity effectively and fairly at all levels are 
likely to reap benefits, are more positive. Thus, 
this study’s findings, which agree with the ILO 
(2006),  support  including  a  commitment  to 
managing diversity and equality in definitions 
of high performance work systems.

Implications for Research

Our  research  has  several  implications  that 
merit  further  scientific  investigation.  First, 
based  on  our  research, a  case  can  be  made 
that  HPWS  should  be  expanded  to  include 
measures  of  the  extent  to  which  organiza-
tions practice diversity management, includ-
ing  legal  compliance–related  measures  such 
as  monitoring  fairness  in  recruitment  and 
promotion  and  latent  cultural  aspects  that 
measure  the  extent  to  which  the  firm  em-
braces  a  culture  of  diversity  at  the  strategic 
and operational levels. The fact that the In-
ternational  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  has 
recommended these same measures suggests 
that it is an area well worth investigating in 
contexts beyond Ireland.

Second, while we have established cross-
sectional  effects,  it  would  be  interesting  to 
explore  the  effects  of  adopting  and  using 
diversity  management  in  a  longitudinal 
research  design.  Beyond  firm  performance, 
it would be important to trace the impact of 
diversity  management  on  employee-level 
outcomes  such  as  satisfaction,  stress,  and 
well-being.  The  exact  composition  of 
a  diversity  management  index  is  another 
area  of  potential  investigation,  as  are  the 

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

dimensions of which such an index may be 
composed, if any.

In  this  study,  we  conceptualized  HPWS 
and  DEMS  as  related  but  distinct  parts  of 
the same system—distinct because they are 
composed  of  different  practices  and  likely 
have  different  intermediate  effects,  but 
related  because  our  bivariate  (correlation) 
results demonstrate that they appear to co-
vary to a certain extent. The OLS results also 
suggest a fairly strong relationship between 
the  two  such  that,  as  HPWS  in-
creases,  so  does  DEMS.  Further 
research  should  thus  investigate 
the  exact  nature  of  the  relation-
ship  between  these  two  con-
structs  more  fully,  in  particular 
exploring the possibility that HR 
systems  and  diversity/equality 
practices  may  have  complemen-
tary or synergistic relationships.
Diversity and equality manage-
ment  could  legitimately  be  con-
ceived  as  a  corporate  social 
responsibility initiative. Thus, the 
firm performance measures could 
be  broadened 
include  a 
corporate  social  responsibility 
orientation, which would involve 
considering 
firm/organization 
performance  more  broadly,  rather  than  just 
in  terms  of  the  bottom  line.  Specifically,  it 
could take into account the social and ethi-
cal effects of its activities on its staff and the 
community around it.

Based on our 

research, a case 

can be made that 

HPWS should

management.

Implications for Practice

HR managers can use these findings to argue 
that  legally  complying  with  diversity  man-
agement legislation has a positive economic 
impact on firm performance. From a practice 
and  policy  perspective,  this  is  a  significant 
finding. Policy agencies charged with ensur-
ing  compliance  with  EEO  legislation  now 
have the evidence to prove that the diversity 
and  equality  management  aspects  of  EEO 
legislation should be seen less as a compliance 
chore  and  more  as  a  performance-
improvement  opportunity.  Bridging  the 
theoretical and practical domains to build a

convincing  case  for  investing  in  HR  is  a 
perennial  problem 
for  organizational 
development specialists and human resource 
directors.  While  considerable  attention  has 
been  paid  to  the  ability,  motiva-
tion,  and  opportunity  (AMO) 
formula to predict employee per-
formance,  it  has  rarely  been 
interpreted  through  the  lens  of 
diversity management. We believe 
that  judiciously  managing  diver-
sity will increase the human capi-
tal inherent in “ability” and also 
directly  link  “opportunity”  and 
“motivation” to performance via 
fairness  of  opportunity 
in 
recruitment  and  promotion. 
Thus,  there  are  sound  practical 
and  academic  reasons  for  our 
research to assure and encourage 
HR  professionals  that  diversity 
management  is  important  for 
organizational  performance.  We 
believe our research provides the 
foundation  for  evidence-based 
management  that  practitioners 
have been seeking for some time.

using a coherent 

management system 

demonstrate even 

greater effects in 

terms of business 

performance.

Limitations

Results  should  be 
interpreted 
cautiously  given  research  design 
limitations.  These  data  were  col-
lected  simultaneously;  therefore, 
“causal”  relationships  may  be  reversed.  For 
example,  the  measure  of  voluntary  turnover 
asked respondents to report their current an-
nual turnover rates, and these rates were “pre-
dicted” by current HPWS and DEMS practices. 
If respondents actually reported the previous 
year’s  turnover  rates,  then  one  could  argue 
that  our  design  and  data  are  “temporally 
backward” (Way, 2002). While it is more plau-
sible  to  argue  that  HR  systems  and  manage-
ment  practices 
influence  productivity, 
workforce innovation, and turnover, it is cer-
tainly possible that firms experiencing greater 
success are better positioned to invest in these 
HR  practices.  Second,  although  we  tested 
non-response bias, whenever survey response 
rates  are  less  than  100%,  bias  may  be 

introduced into the data. Third, although we 
explore  mediating  relationships  between 
HPWS,  DEMS,  and  firm-level  outcomes,  we 
do not explicate other relevant pathways (i.e., 
the  proverbial  black  box  problem  [Becker  & 
Huselid, 2006; Macky & Boxall, 2007].

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate a strong business case 
for  building  management  systems  that  deal 
effectively  with  issues  related  to  traditional 
strategic human resources management, diver-
sity,  and  equality.  Companies  that  manage 
these  issues  more  extensively  demonstrate 
higher  levels  of  business  performance,  and 
companies  that  manage  these  issues  using  a 
coherent  management  system  demonstrate 
even greater effects in terms of business perfor-
mance.  Specifically,  when  the  firms  we  sur-
veyed used HPWS and DEMS in tandem, the 
combined bundle explained 13.2% of the vari-
ance in labor productivity, 8.8% of the varia-
tion in workforce innovation, and 8% of the 
variance  in  voluntary  employee  turnover. 
Through our data analysis, we estimated that 
increasing  DEMS  from  “average”  to  “above 
average”  would,  for  the  typical  firm  in  our 
sample,  increase  sales  per  employee  by 
€ 60,420.

While  our  design  does  not  allow  us  to 
claim  a  causal  relationship  between  our 
expanded  set  of  high  performance  work 
practices  and  business  performance  out-
comes, we do provide useful insights for any 
company  seeking  to  build  competitive 
advantage  by  managing  people  effectively. 
These results challenge public policy makers, 
researchers,  and  management  practitioners 
to  think  of  high  performance  management 
practices in a more expansive way than has 
been the norm until now. While traditional 
HPWS will remain a core concern in terms of 
“best  practices,”  our  results  suggest  that 
companies  may  also  find  competitive  ad-
vantage  through  more  effective  approaches 
to managing employee diversity and equal-
ity. Such issues should no longer be consid-
ered a matter of regulatory compliance, but 
as  management  policies  with  the  potential 
to impact firm performance positively.

THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE

This article began with a quotation from 
Lew  Platt  (former  CEO  of  Hewlett  Packard) 
from a speech that he gave to the Diversity 
Research Network at Stanford Business School 
in  1998,  where  he  asked  for  empirical  evi-
dence that diversity could improve organiza-
tion performance. Our findings do just that.

Notes

1.  Because  the  HPWS,  DEMS,  and  turnover  data 
were  all  obtained  from  a  single  source,  we  con-
ducted  Harman’s  one-factor  test  (Podsakoff  & 
Organ, 1986) to assess the degree to which inter-
correlations among the variables might be an ar-
tifact  of  common  method  variance.  Common 
method variance is indicated if either (1) a single 
factor  emerges  or  (2)  a  general  factor  accounts 
for  a  majority  of  the  variance. These  conditions 
were  not  observed,  thus  mitigating—but  not 
eliminating—concerns 
common 
method bias.
