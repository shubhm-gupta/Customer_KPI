Arguments can be made on both sides of the question of whether a stringent global

corporate environmental standard represents a competitive asset or liability for multi-
national enterprises (MNEs) investing in emerging and developing markets. Analyzing the
global environmental standards of a sample of U.S.-based MNEs in relation to their stock
market performance, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms adopting a single stringent global environmental
standard have much higher market values, as measured by Tobin’s q, than ﬁrms defaulting
to less stringent, or poorly enforced host country standards. Thus, developing countries that
use lax environmental regulations to attract foreign direct investment may end up attracting
poorer quality, and perhaps less competitive, ﬁrms. Our results also suggest that externalities
are incorporated to a signiﬁcant extent in ﬁrm valuation. We discuss plausible reasons for this
observation.

1. Introduction
Global companies have become major players on the
world stage. There are now in excess of 40,000 multi-
national enterprises (MNEs) with some 250,000 for-
eign afﬁliates, investing more than $200 billion abroad
each year (UNCTAD 1995). About 40% of world trade
consists of intraﬁrm transfers of materials and compo-
nents within MNEs (Greider 1997). The 10 largest
MNEs have annual sales in excess of the gross national
products of the 100 smallest countries in the world
(Hawken 1993, p. 92). Foreign direct investment (FDI)
now exceeds ofﬁcial development assistance by a
factor of ﬁve, whereas ﬁve years ago it was less than
half (Wolfensohn 1997).

MNEs create, leverage, and arbitrage capabilities on
a world scale. They are known to make positive

contributions in economic efﬁciency (see, e.g., Caves
1996, Ch. 7) and serve as a conduit for the globaliza-
tion of economies. However, MNEs have also proven
elusive of public policy controls because of their
economic power and ability to shift resources and
production across borders. Questions have been
raised concerning MNEs’ social and environmental
performance (e.g., in regard to their pollution record
and labor practices, etc.) Social critics have argued that
MNEs, in seeking to reduce costs, play employees and
countries against one another, creating downward
pressure on wages and social standards on a world-
wide basis (Gladwin et al. 1995, Greider 1997).

Our focus is on the environmental aspect. Led by
MNEs, the afﬂuent societies of the developed world
account for more than 75% of the world’s energy and

resource consumption and create the bulk of the
industrial, toxic, and consumer waste (Hart 1997).
Environmentalists contend that MNEs are now engag-
ing in ﬂight to “pollution havens” by moving dirty
operations to countries where regulatory standards
are less stringent (Daly 1994). Through ﬂight to pollu-
tion havens, MNEs can avoid expensive pollution
controls, cut costs by recapitalizing old equipment,
and continue to make products that are no longer
considered environmentally acceptable in the more
highly regulated markets of the developed world
(Vernon 1992). Over time, it is claimed that these
practices lead to a “race to the bottom” as poor nations
and localities vie for plants and facilities that seek only
to minimize cost and externalize environmental re-
sponsibility (Korten 1995).

While some MNEs clearly utilize such practices, it is
unclear whether there is systematic advantage in
racing to the bottom. There appear to be forces that
encourage MNEs to integrate and standardize their
environmental practices globally. Indeed, it may make
business sense in some cases to adopt global standards
that exceed those required by some local laws or
regulations, especially when environmental laws and
regulations become more stringent as an economy
grows. By investing in state-of-the-art technology and
processes in developing countries, MNE facilities may
be able to achieve simultaneously world-class cost,
quality, and environmental performance. In addition,
MNE’s may reap standardization beneﬁts and other
intangible advantages like positive reputation effects.
In this paper, we therefore seek an empirical answer
to an intriguing and important question: Is ﬁrm value
linked to an MNE’s corporate environmental policy?
Speciﬁcally, we examine whether adopting a single
stringent corporate environmental standard enhances
ﬁrm value compared to those MNEs defaulting to less
stringent or poorly enforced host country standards.
We ﬁnd that ﬁrms adopting a stringent global envi-
ronmental standard have higher market values, as
measured by Tobin’s q (market value over replace-
ment costs of tangible assets). Our results have strong
implications: “Better ﬁrms” appear to adopt higher
environmental standards and pollute less. However,
we cannot identify with our data any causal (time

series) relationships between either past changes in
environmental standards and current change in ﬁrm
value, or past change in ﬁrm value and current change
in environmental standards.

In the next section, we describe prior research
linked to the current work that is helpful in interpret-
ing our results. In the third section, we discuss theory
and propose our research questions. We present our
methodology in §4 and results in §5. Discussion of the
results and conclusions are contained in §6 and 7,
respectively.

2. Prior Research
A growing body of literature ties superior environ-
mental performance to ﬁnancial performance (e.g.
Porter and van der Linde 1995, Hart 1995). For exam-
ple, three recent studies link proactive environmental
management to superior stock performance: Hamilton
(1995), White (1995), and Klassen and McLaughlin
(1996) all use event study methodology to demon-
strate that (1) news of high levels of toxic emissions
results in signiﬁcant negative abnormal returns; (2)
ﬁrms with strong environmental management prac-
tices have better stock price returns than ﬁrms with
poor practices after a major environmental disaster,
such as the Exxon Valdez accident; and (3) environ-
mental performance awards result in signiﬁcant posi-
tive abnormal returns. The ﬁrst and second results
indicate that investors expect that ﬁrms incur non-
trivial costs for environmental cleanup and that these
costs are lower for ﬁrms with better environmental
records. The third result suggests that recognition of
environmental performance has a positive reputation
effect which possibly augments ﬁrm value.1

Feldman et al. (1996) analyze a sample of 300 large
public companies in the United States to see if invest-
ments in environmental management lead to reduced
risk, and if such risk reduction is valued by ﬁnancial
markets. Their ﬁndings suggest that investments in
environmental management lead to substantial reduc-
tion in perceived risk of a ﬁrm, with an accompanying

1 The positive reputation effect may include not just investors’
impressions of a ﬁrm’s environmental performance; it may also
include investors’ impressions of a ﬁrm’s management quality.

increase in a public company’s stock price, of perhaps
ﬁve percent.

Other scholars have examined the relationship be-
tween environmental and proﬁt performance. Cohen
et al. (1995), for example, demonstrate a strong corre-
lation between environmental performance and ﬁrm
proﬁtability. Similarly, Hart and Ahuja (1996) present
evidence indicating that efforts to prevent pollution
and reduce emissions are positively associated with
the “bottom line” (as measured by return on sales and
return on assets) within one to two years of initiation,
and that those ﬁrms with the highest emission levels
stand to gain the most. Russo and Fouts (1997), in their
study of 243 ﬁrms, ﬁnd that environmental perfor-
mance and return on assets (ROA) are positively
linked, and that industry growth moderates this rela-
tionship, with returns to environmental performance
higher for high-growth industries. Finally, Nehrt
(1996) examines the relationship between timing and
intensity of investment in pollution prevention and
growth in proﬁts within a sample of 50 pulp and
paper companies. His results indicate a positive rela-
tionship between early movers in pollution prevention
and proﬁt growth.

While results are generally convergent, most empir-
ical work to date has been restricted to MNEs in the
United States or Western Europe where data are more
available regarding environmental performance (e.g.,
Kennelly 1996). There has been some conceptual and
case study treatment of MNE environmental perfor-
mance in foreign contexts and developing countries
(e.g., Korten 1995, Hart 1997), but little empirical
research on this dimension has been conducted. The
limited empirical work that has been done suggests
that MNEs are more environmentally responsible than
their local competitors in developing countries (Eske-
land and Harrison 1997), but the evidence regarding
MNE social performance is mixed (e.g., Zahra et al.
1993, Johnson and Greening 1994). We were unable to
ﬁnd any published empirical research focusing specif-
ically on the question of how MNE international
environmental standards, particularly their behavior
in developing countries, affect ﬁrm market value. It is
to that question that we now turn our attention.

3. Theory
Arguments can be made on both sides of the question
of whether a stringent global corporate environmental
standard represents a competitive asset or liability for
MNEs. Below, we articulate the major theoretical
lenses on either side of the argument.

Global Environmental Standards as Altruistic
Liability
Conventional economic logic suggests that, ceteris pa-
ribus, in countries where environmental regulation is
either lax or not enforced, it is cheaper to operate than
in countries where strict environmental regulations
result in ﬁnes, liabilities, and administrative or legal
action against polluters (Stewart 1993). For example,
the annual cost of complying with environmental
regulation in the United States now exceeds $125
billion, or about 2.1% of GDP. In most developing
countries, environmental spending represents only a
fraction of 1% of GDP (Jaffe et al. 1995).

Evidence also suggests that strict pollution control
regulations in the United States may have an adverse
impact on productivity (Gray and Shadbegian 1993),
perhaps by forcing companies to commit resources
and manpower to nonproductive uses such as envi-
ronmental auditing, waste treatment, and litigation
(Haveman and Christiansen 1981). Hence, when oper-
ating in countries with less stringent or poorly en-
forced environmental regulations, defaulting to local
standards reduces costs.

Furthermore, by defaulting to local standards in
countries with lax regulation or enforcement, compa-
nies may be able to recapitalize old equipment that is
no longer acceptable in more regulated markets,
thereby lowering costs even further. Companies can
also market products in such countries that may be
discouraged or even banned for environmental rea-
sons in more regulated markets, thereby extending
product life cycles and revenue streams (Vernon 1992,
Korten 1995).

In short, there may be considerable ﬁnancial penal-
ties associated with overly general or constraining
environmental policies in response to standardized
criteria when it is not really needed or justiﬁed (Ron-
dinelli and Vastag 1996). Overall, the presumption is
that defaulting to local standards is cost-saving, and

Corporate Global Environmental Standards and Market Value

that adhering to more stringent environmental stan-
dards where they are not required or enforced is
wasteful. Firms that are altruistic in their attempts to
achieve higher environmental standards when invest-
ing in low-standard countries are not serving their
shareholders. The behavior hurts market value and
may be a reﬂection of managerial idiosyncrasies.

Global Environmental Standards as Value-Adding
Asset
A competing logic suggests that value-seeking inves-
tors may view defaulting to lower or poorly enforced
local environmental standards as counterproductive
to long-term proﬁt performance. First, the cost savings
associated with lower environmental standards may
be exaggerated and may not even exist: MNEs often
ﬁnd that they have to pay for the remediation of
environmental damages even if they are in full com-
pliance with local regulations and requirements, often
due to pressures from environmental interest groups
or international organizations (e.g., World Bank). Such
cleanup costs can be signiﬁcant.

Second, in making new investments, a ﬁrm may
ﬁnd that moving downward from accustomed higher
standards violates established corporate routines and
is actually more costly than adhering to the higher
standards, even in the absence of regulation. By spec-
ifying a single corporate standard, performance mon-
itoring and evaluation costs might be reduced because
a single set of values, speciﬁcations, and procedures
can be deployed throughout the world, without the
need to consider local deviations from the norm.
Global standardization will also mean that production
improvements made in one location can readily be
transferred to all subsidiaries. Global strategies lever-
age the return on investment in improvements made
in high environmental standard regions across all
geographic locations (Prahalad and Doz 1987, Bartlett
and Ghoshal 1989). Thus, adopting a single stringent
environmental standard is consistent with pursuit of
global competitive strategies by MNEs (Christmann
1998).

Third, while adequate environmental standards
may not yet exist in many developing countries, it can
be argued that in the not-too-distant future, standards
will rise as income increases and people become more

sensitive toward and concerned about environmental
deterioration. This pattern of environmental regula-
tion following GDP growth has already been observed
among newly industrialized nations such as Taiwan,
Korea, and Singapore (Grossman and Krueger 1995).
In other words, there may be an important future
beneﬁt to adopting a single global standard if the
productive life of capital extends beyond the period of
lax or poorly enforced regulation.

When the environmental standards in developing
countries improve with increases in per capita income,
ﬁrms performing above current requirements will not
need additional investment, while ﬁrms defaulting to
the current minimums will need to reinvest to con-
form to the heightened requirements. A foresighted
ﬁrm could take advantage of this by adopting higher
environmental standards than are dictated by current
regulations. MNEs are especially well-positioned in
this regard: They can actually use the environment as
a strategic competitive advantage by speeding up the
process (e.g., by lobbying for tighter environmental
regulations) and thus outcompete local ﬁrms with
lesser ﬁnancial means, knowledge, and capability.

Fourth, the presumption that polluting lowers pro-
duction cost can be challenged. Putting aside the issue
of regulatory stringency, there are other ways in
which environmental standards may affect competi-
tiveness. Speciﬁcally, not all environmental regula-
tions affect ﬁrms’ behavior in the same manner, and
the form of environmental regulation can be an im-
portant determinant of business impact. For example,
U.S. environmental regulations often mandate speciﬁc
control or treatment
technologies. These so-called
“command and control” style regulations dictate that
speciﬁc pollution control technologies be used, often
at an exorbitant cost (Porter and van der Linde 1995).
However, in many cases, it is possible to reduce or
eliminate pollution by making changes in the manu-
facturing or production process, rather than capturing
pollutants for treatment or disposal at the “end-of-the-
pipe.” Pollution and waste are reduced at the outset
by a conscious effort to heighten resource efﬁciency.
Many state-of-the-art technologies have high resource
productivity. Such “eco-efﬁciency” can actually lower

operating costs, rather than raise them (Porter and van
der Linde 1995, Hart and Ahuja 1996).

Finally, there may be fringe beneﬁts associated with
adhering to higher environmental standards. By com-
mitting to standards that exceed those of the host
country, the company might beneﬁt from heightened
employee morale and thus productivity (Romm 1993).
Adopting an internal corporate environmental stan-
dard ahead of legal requirements avoids special inter-
est group pressures and may result in positive repu-
tation effects for the ﬁrm, improving its public image
relative to competitors.

These considerations suggest that a ﬁrm defaulting
to lower or poorly enforced local environmental stan-
dards may be overlooking both tangible and intangi-
ble beneﬁts associated with conforming to a higher
global standard. Firms conforming to a higher global
environmental standard may ﬁnd that the strategy
enhances value.

Value Creation or Destruction?
The conﬂicting nature of the above arguments sug-
gests that the relationship between corporate environ-
mental standards and ﬁrm value is an empirical
question. We therefore investigate two questions:

1. Are MNEs which exceed local environment
standards (those adopting higher global standards)
higher- or lower-value ﬁrms? Is adhering to higher
global environmental standards associated with
higher market value or does it represent a nonpro-
ductive use of assets and a drag on market value?
2. Is there a detectable lead-lag relationship be-
tween ﬁrm value and environmental standards? In
other words, do changes in environmental standards
cause changes in market value or visa versa?

4. Methods
Sample
The sample of ﬁrms for this study was drawn from the
U.S. Standard and Poor’s 500 list of corporations.
Although this population of ﬁrms is clearly biased
towards the largest ﬁrms, this was not deemed to be a
problem because MNEs were our target sample and
the S&P 500 contains largely MNEs. Our sample
period was from 1994 to 1997. This is the period in

which we have data on both ﬁrm environmental
standards and market value. Although the data source
for our environmental standards, Investor Responsi-
bility Research Center’s (IRRC) Corporate Environ-
mental Proﬁle, collected data prior to 1994, the survey
item that we draw upon changed in 1994, making
comparison with prior years’ data inappropriate.

Two screens were applied in selecting ﬁrms. First,
only those MNEs involved in manufacturing or min-
ing (SIC codes between 2000 and 3999) were selected
because the main research variable, corporate environ-
mental standards, was most salient to these ﬁrms.
Second, only those MNEs with production operations
in countries with GDP per capita below $8,000 (1985
dollars) were included in the study. Evidence suggests
that concern for and activity in environmental regula-
tion decreases dramatically for countries with per
capita income levels below $8,000 (Grossman and
Krueger 1995). Sampling on this dimension therefore
allows us to insure that there is a difference between
those ﬁrms that default to local standards and those
that adopt a global standard. After applying these two
screens to the population, we ended up with eighty-
nine ﬁrms, which were drawn from ﬁfteen two-digit
SIC codes.

Dependent Variable
The key dependent variable (Tobin’s q) is deﬁned as
ﬁrm market value per dollar of replacement costs of
tangible assets. Tobin’s q is widely used as an indica-
tor of intangible value in economics research (e.g.,
Lindenberg and Ross 1981) and in the international
business literature (e.g., Morck and Yeung 1991). We
proxied for ﬁrm market value by summing Compustat-
reported ﬁrm equity value (outstanding shares times
share price), book value of long-term debt, and net
current liabilities. We proxied for replacement costs of
tangible assets by summing book value of inventory
and net value of physical plant and equipment.2

2 A more elaborate estimate for Tobin’s q (e.g., Lindenberg and Ross
1981) and the current simpliﬁed estimate often yield qualitatively
similar results. The key is whether the use of book—instead of
market—value of debts, of inventory, and of plant and equipment
introduces any systematic biases. Such biases are likely to be linked
to industry and ﬁrm size. We incorporate industry effects in our
statistical analyses in case there are any systematic biases linked to

Corporate Global Environmental Standards and Market Value

Independent Variables
The focal information for our independent variable
was derived from the Investor Responsibility Research
Center’s (IRRC) Corporate Environmental Proﬁle.
This data set describes each corporation’s posture with
regard to international environmental policy from
1994 to 1997. Each ﬁrm is allowed to check any of the
following three categories “1,” “2,” or “3” in each year:
(1) local—the corporation adheres to local stan-

dards only;

(2) U.S.—the corporation applies U.S. environmen-

tal standards wherever it does business; and

(3) stringent global—the corporation has its own
internal environmental standard that exceeds any na-
tional standard.

We ﬁrst used this information to code a ﬁrm’s
environmental standards in year t (ENV STD t) as “1,”
“2,” and “3” accordingly. Next, we created two
dummy variables. The ﬁrst, ED t,
indicates that a
ﬁrm’s environmental standard in year t was not
“local” (i.e., the ﬁrm did not adopt “1” in the above
scheme). The second dummy, ED2 t, indicates that a
ﬁrm’s environmental standard in year t was “stringent
global” (i.e.,
the ﬁrm adopted “3” in the above
scheme).

The implicit assumption is that ﬁrms declaring a
lower category of environmental standard pollute
more. This assumption requires validation. Full-scale
validation is difﬁcult, however, because consistent
and reliable pollution data on a global scale do not
exist, especially in developing countries (the pre-
sumed “pollution havens”). We therefore resorted to
validating the assumption based on each ﬁrm’s U.S.
“Toxic Release Inventory” (TRI) data. As expected, we
found that ﬁrms adhering to “local standards” pol-
luted the most, while ﬁrms applying “an internal
global standard that exceeds any national standard”
polluted the least. Firms applying U.S. standards
overseas were in between these two extremes. The
difference between the ﬁrst and the third group is
most statistically signiﬁcant. Details on the validating
effort are reported in the Appendix.

industries. We control for ﬁrm size by using the logarithm of the
ﬁrm’s assets in a given year.

To avoid the missing variable problem, we needed
to include controls known to affect Tobin’s q that are
also plausibly related to a ﬁrm’s choice of environ-
mental standards. Tobin’s q is known to be related to
capital structure, intangibles like R&D and advertising
expenditures, and multinationality (e.g., Morck and
Yeung 1991). Hence, we included in our regression
analyses the following control variables: R&D inten-
sity (R&D/dollars of total assets), advertising inten-
sity (ADV/dollars of total assets), leverage (long-term
debt/dollars of total assets), and multinationality (per-
cent of foreign assets/dollars of total assets).3 We also
included ﬁrm size (deﬁned as the log of total dollars of
assets) to control for the possibility that ﬁrm size is
related with Tobin’s q. 4 All data were obtained from
Compustat for the years 1994–1997, except multina-
tionality, which was obtained from Worldscope.

These control variables are possibly correlated with
a ﬁrm’s choice of environmental standards. For exam-
ple, large and more internationally oriented ﬁrms are
likely to be highly conscious of their public image
because of the large scale and scope of any negative
ramiﬁcation from bad publicity. Highly leveraged
ﬁrms may be less able to afford the investment re-
quired to implement more stringent global environ-
mental standards.

3 We also used the percentage of foreign sales as an alternative
speciﬁcation of multinationality. The results were in all cases not
signiﬁcantly different from those obtained using the percentage of
foreign assets.
4 There are other variables that are known to affect Tobin’s q.
First, there may be industry-level effects like competitive struc-
ture and growth potential. We ﬁlter these out by using two-digit
SIC industry dummies to capture ﬁxed industry effects. There are
also other known ﬁrm-level effects that affect Tobin’s q. One of
these is growth trends. However, one runs the risk of double
counting the growth effect if investment in intangibles is already
incorporated. Product diversiﬁcation can also affect Tobin’s q.
Product diversiﬁcation is highly correlated with geographic
diversiﬁcation. Excluding either does not, however, affect the
behavior of the other, as the comparison between Morck and
Yeung (1998, Table 2) and Morck and Yeung (1991, Tables 4 and
5) illustrates. To conserve degrees of freedom and to avoid
collinearity, we do not include these extra explanatory variables.
Following a referee’s suggestion, we include the log of size (total
dollars of assets) as an independent variable.

Corporate Global Environmental Standards and Market Value

Data Analysis
We used both bivariate and multivariate analyses to
address the research questions. With regard to the ﬁrst
question, we identiﬁed the statistical relationship be-
tween ﬁrm value and level of corporate environmental
standard using t-tests and multiple regression. We
recognize that using the panel data entails counting
ﬁrms with unchanged environmental standard multi-
ple times, which exaggerates sample size and thus the
t-statistics. We corrected for this by replacing the
ﬁrm-year data with ﬁrm-average data when we con-
ducted bivariate analyses (i.e., simple correlations).
When we conducted multivariate regression analysis,
we used the ﬁrm-average data to run “group mean”
regressions. We also ran random ﬁrm effects regres-
sions that utilize all available data points in our
cross-sectional panel.5

To create the ﬁrm-average data, we averaged the
dependent and independent variables for each year in
which the ﬁrm reported a consistent environmental
standard. Thus, a ﬁrm that used host country stan-
dards in every year would have one observation in the
averaged ﬁrm-year data, while a ﬁrm that changed
from host to U.S. standards would have two observa-
tions—one for each of the environmental standards.
Out of our 89 ﬁrms, 72 never changed their environ-
mental standards, 16 did so once and one did so
twice.6 Out of the 18 total changes, 12 were “positive”
(upgrading environmental standards) while 6 were
“negative” (downgrading environmental standards).
Hence, there are 107 (89 ⫹ 12 ⫹ 6) ﬁrm-average
observations. There were 6 missing “environmental
standards” data points in our sample period. Out of
these 107 observations, 30 adopted “local environmen-
tal standards,” 18 adopted “U.S. standards” and 59
adopted “stringent global standards.”

5 In conducting multivariate regression analyses on the relationship
between Tobin’s q and environmental standards, we did not intro-
duce ﬁrm ﬁxed effects because for a very large proportion of our
sample ﬁrms the focal independent variable (environmental stan-
dard) does not have much variation.
6 We are not able to tell whether the changes reported by the ﬁrm
are real or due to reporting errors. As a conservative robustness
check, we repeated our analyses excluding the ﬁrm. Our results
remained intact.

With regard to the second question, we used the
Granger causality method which involves regressing,
in turn, a) ﬁrm value on its own lags and past
environmental standard; and b) environmental stan-
dard on its own lags and past ﬁrm value. When we
performed the causality tests, we used the full panel
data, rather than the ﬁrm-average data. When past
changes in environmental standards predict current
changes in market value, but past changes in market
value do not explain current changes in environmen-
tal standards, we can conclude that adopting a higher
environmental standard causes market value increase.
When the reverse is true, we can conclude that higher
ﬁrm value causes adoption of more stringent global
environmental standards.

5. Results
Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and
simple correlations for the variables based on ﬁrm-
average data in our study. As expected, we ﬁnd a
positive correlation between a ﬁrm’s Tobin’s q and its
levels of research and development and advertising,
and its multinationality. Likewise, a negative correla-
tion is found between the Tobin’s q value and the
leverage of the ﬁrm. We now turn to consideration of
our two research questions.

Are Stringent Environmental Standards and
Market Value Compatible?
The key result in Table 1 is that ﬁrms that do not adopt
local environmental standards have higher market
values. The dummy variable ED7 allows us to com-
pare ﬁrms that do not adopt local environmental
standards to those that do. ED2 allows us to compare
ﬁrms that adopt a stringent global environmental
standard to those that do not. Both ED and ED2 are
positively and signiﬁcantly correlated with Tobin’s q.
These observations provide preliminary evidence that
those companies that go beyond local environmental
standards have higher market values. Furthermore,
companies adopting their own “internal environmen-
tal standard” have the highest Tobin’s q values.

To better understand the differences in the charac-

ED2 is unnecessary.

teristics of the ﬁrm types, we present, in Table 2, the
results of t-tests for the differences between the means
of Tobin’s q, R&D, advertising, leverage, and multi-
nationality at the three levels of environmental stan-
dards (see Table 2). The ﬁrst interesting observation in
Table 2 is that defaulting to local environmental
standards is by no means the most common practice
(only 30 out of 107 ﬁt this description). Rather, the
most common strategy in this sample is to adopt a
stringent internal standard that is applied globally (59
out of 107 observations).

The t-tests reveal that those companies which use

U.S. standards worldwide have insigniﬁcantly higher
Tobin’s q values than those companies which use the
standards of the various host countries in which they
operate. (The t statistic is at best marginally signiﬁcant
at the 10% level, 1-tail.) However, the ﬁrms that
employ their own internal standard around the world
have signiﬁcantly higher Tobin’s q values than those
that use U.S. standards. The remaining t-tests in Table
2 indicate that the ﬁrms that use host, U.S., or internal
environmental standards have roughly equal levels of
R&D and advertising. However, ﬁrms using host
country environmental standards are most leveraged,

while ﬁrms using internal environmental standards
are the largest and attain the highest level of multina-
tionality.

Of course, the analyses presented thus far do not
control for factors that may be driving the observed
relationships (e.g., spending on intangibles, ﬁrm size,
leverage, and multinationality, etc.). In particular,
there could be industry effects present. For example,
some industries (e.g., pharmaceuticals, where ﬁrms
have generally high Tobin’s q values) utilize highly
toxic chemicals and materials, making such ﬁrms
more likely to adopt higher environmental standards.
Therefore, we conduct multivariate analyses that con-
trol for these effects.8

Table 3 reports piecewise regressions which com-
pare ﬁrms adopting the different types of environ-
mental standards using the ED and ED2 dummy
variables described above. Here, the base case in the
regressions is the Tobin’s q of ﬁrms adopting local
standards. The regression coefﬁcient for ED reveals
the difference in Tobin’s q between ﬁrms adopting
U.S. standards worldwide and ﬁrms adopting local
standards. The regression coefﬁcient for ED2 reveals
the difference in Tobin’s q between ﬁrms adopting a
stringent internal standard and ﬁrm adopting U.S.
standards worldwide. The difference in Tobin’s q
between ﬁrms adopting a stringent internal standard
and ﬁrms adopting local standards is the sum of the
regression coefﬁcients for ED and ED2.9

Regressions 3-a and 3-b are group mean regressions
based on ﬁrm-average data that we used in Tables 1
and 2. Regressions 3-c and 3-d are random ﬁrm effects
regressions that utilize all available ﬁrm-year observa-
tions. In 3-a and 3-c we do not include industry
dummies, while in 3-b and 3-d we do. The results in all
regression models are very consistent across all re-

8 To control for industry ﬁxed effects, we use two-digit SIC industry
dummies. It is possible to use three-digit SIC industry dummies and
doing so does not change our results. However, there are some
three-digit SIC industries with very few ﬁrms (some have only one).
To avoid this potential problem, we opt to report results based on
two-digit SIC industry dummies.
9 We also conducted regressions using the ENV STD variable. The
results are consistent with what we report in Table 3, but less
revealing. These results are available upon request.

conﬁrm that adopting a stringent internally deﬁned
global standard is positively associated with a ﬁrm’s
stock market value.

We checked the robustness of our results. We ﬁrst
conducted residual diagnostics. We found no outli-
ers whose deletion materially affects the results of
our regression analyses. Heteroskedasticity is a con-
cern with our data, especially in our group mean
regressions in which we analyzed ﬁrm-average ob-
servations, where the number of observations from
which the ﬁrm-averages are derived is not ﬁxed.
Accordingly, we conducted White’s (1980) speciﬁ-
cation test, and determined that heteroskedasticity
is not affecting our results. Finally,
to be very
conservative (but sacriﬁcing statistical efﬁciency),
we repeated regressions 3-a and 3-b using year-by-
year data, one year’s worth of data per run. We
found qualitatively similar results.

Based on the above statistical analyses, we conclude
that there is a reliable positive and signiﬁcant relation-
ship between the use of a single global environmental
standard and a ﬁrm’s Tobin’s q.

Do Higher Environmental Standards Cause
Increases in Market Value?
Our next step is to explore causality in this relation-
ship using the original time series panel data. Does
upgrading the ﬁrm’s environmental standards lead to
higher ﬁrm value (higher Tobin’s q)? Or, is it the case
that increases in a ﬁrm’s Tobin’s q result in higher
environmental standards?

To address this question, we ﬁrst regress Tobin’s
q on the ﬁve control variables used in earlier regres-
sion runs. We then do the same for our environmen-
tal standards variable (ENV STD t) as deﬁned in
§4. We use this variable because it has more
variation than either ED or ED2. The residuals from
these regression runs comprise the portion of To-
bin’s q and environmental standards respectively
not explained by R&D, advertising, leverage, total
assets, and multinationality. We then regress To-
bin’s q residuals for a given ﬁrm on the lagged
values of the Tobin’s q residual and the lagged
values of the environmental standards’ residual. We
do not know what time length,
if any, will be
appropriate for the lagged effect to be noticeable, so

we present one, two, and three-year lags. These
results are reported in Table 4a, columns 4a-1 to
4a-3. We repeat the analysis replacing ENV STD t by
ED2 t. These results are reported in columns 4a-4 to
4a-6. 10 All speciﬁcations reveal consistent results.

The results in Table 4a indicate that the previous
years’ environmental standards are not signiﬁcant
predictors of current Tobin’s q values.11 We tried
several alternative speciﬁcations for assessing whether
a change in environmental standards led to a change
in Tobin’s q in future years. All results consistently
showed that there is no lagged reaction to environ-
mental standards on the part of the market. One
interpretation is that our sample data have too few
changes in environmental standards (only 17 ﬁrms out
of 89 ﬁrms did so) to be able to generate statistically
reliable results. Another plausible speculation is that
the stock market upgrades a ﬁrm’s market value
within an annual time window once the ﬁrm adopts a
higher environmental standard.12

Using the same analytical approach, we also looked
to see whether ﬁrms that had changes in market
valuations altered their environmental standards in
subsequent years, but there was no evidence that such
a link existed (see Table 4b).

In summary, we have found a signiﬁcant and
positive relationship between the market value of a
company (as measured by Tobin’s q) and the level of
environmental standard it uses. This effect remains
even after we have controlled for industry effects as
well as other factors known to affect Tobin’s q.
Furthermore, our results suggest that a ﬁrm’s mar-

10 Regressions 4a-4 to 4a-6 were suggested by a referee.
11 We recognize that the “unit root” problem may be present in our
results in Table 5a and 5b, because in each case, the coefﬁcient on the
one-year lagged values of the dependent variable are not signiﬁ-
cantly different from 1.0. We attempted a ﬁrst-difference analysis in
order to correct for this potential problem, but this leaves us with
only 42 observations in one year and may thus have the usual small
sample difﬁculties. The results of the ﬁrst-difference analysis do not
contradict our reported ﬁndings.
12 As long as ﬁrm valuation is based on expectations, our result is
not inconsistent with results obtained by, e.g., Hart and Ahuja
(1996) which show that efforts to prevent pollution and reduce
emissions leads to an increase in return on sales and assets after one
or two years.

ket value appreciates quickly once a ﬁrm adopts a
higher environmental
standard. However, past
changes in market value do not predict whether a
ﬁrm will adopt higher environmental standards in
the future.

6. Discussion
Our ﬁnding that adopting stringent global environ-
mental standards is positively associated with a
higher ﬁrm value is open to several possible interpre-
tations. First, it may be that private valuations inter-
nalize environmental externalities: The less negative
externalities a ﬁrm imposes, the higher the ﬁrm value.
Second, it is possible that adopting stringent environ-
mental standards is actually more proﬁtable than
defaulting to lower or poorly enforced local environ-
mental standards. Finally, poorly managed and less
competitive ﬁrms may tend to adopt lower environ-
mental standards. In this section, we discuss each of
these interpretations.

Internalization of Externalities
The ﬁrst interpretation is based not only on our data,
but also on the results of other studies (e.g., Hamilton
1995, White 1995, Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). All
these results suggest that investors incorporate poten-
tial environmental problems and liabilities into their
pricing of companies. In developed economies with
strong regulatory regimes, the mechanism exists to
support this observation: The institutional and legal
systems support the public’s rights to a clean environ-
ment so that polluters have to pay for their environ-
mental damage. Hence, ﬁrms that have higher poten-
tial environmental
liabilities realize lower market
values.

The focus of this study (developing countries),
however, involves locations where environmental
regulations are lax or property rights to a clean
environment are poorly enforced. In these contexts,
other mechanisms must be at work. One possible
mechanism for the internalization of externalities
under these circumstances is as follows: Interest

groups and nongovernmental organizations expose
unsound corporate environmental practices, raise
consumer awareness, and put pressure on govern-
ments to discipline polluters even if the pollution
is in overseas locations. Through these means
poor environmental performance is translated into
bad public image, lower consumer goodwill, and
ultimately, lower ﬁrm value. 13 Aware of this disci-

13 For example, The Economist (July 20, 1996; “The fun of being a
multinational”) reported that:

In Malaysia, a $5.5 billion hydroelectric dam to be built by a
consortium including ABB Asea´ Brown Boveri, a Swiss-
based multinational, is being attacked by local people and
western environmental groups for destroying rainforest. The
average oil baron or mining boss might once have shrugged
off such events as little local difﬁculties. Some even relished
a brawl. Nowadays, they recognise that the stakes are higher.
It is not only the prospect of consumer boycotts that worries
them. In addition, staff morale can suffer (many Shell em-
ployees opposed the sinking of the Brent Spar), political
contacts can be upset (Nelson Mandela denounced Shell’s
behaviour in Nigeria) and worst of all sanctions can be

plinary effect, far-sighted managers conscious of
ﬁrm value opt to maintain a high level of environ-
mental practice, even where regulations do not
require it.

Bottom-line Beneﬁts
There appear to be economic implications of adopting
high environmental standards that extend beyond the
negative or “disciplinary” effects associated with poor
environmental performance discussed above. In fact,
the smallest coefﬁcient for ED2 (Table 3, regression
3-d) indicates that ﬁrms adopting their own stringent
global environmental standards have a Tobin’s q that
is approximately 1.002 higher than those using U.S.
standards abroad. Given the mean value of ﬁrm
tangible assets in our sample, 1.002 represents more
than $8.6 billion per ﬁrm. If we use the average of the
regression coefﬁcients for ED2 in Table 4, the number
increases to $10.4 billion per ﬁrm. Even company

tracts with ﬁrms doing business in Myanmar).

Exxon Valdez accident) are less than $8 billion (The
Lamp 1999). The magnitude of the value increase
associated with higher environmental standards thus
represents more than just the monetarization of neg-
ative externalities.

We therefore advance our second interpretation:
Adopting stringent environmental standards is more
proﬁtable than defaulting to lower or poorly enforced
local environmental standards. This interpretation is
consistent with other studies (e.g., Cohen et al. 1995,
Hart and Ahuja 1996, Russo and Fouts 1997), all of
which suggest a higher level of proﬁtability associated
with better environmental practices and efforts to
reduce emissions and waste.

We need to be careful, however, in explaining how
stringent environmental standards might raise proﬁt
performance. Two possible mechanisms apply. First, it
may be that adopting the latest technologies and
equipment increases productivity, and that is what
makes the investment worthwhile. Better environ-
mental practices are embedded in the latest technolo-
gies as a result of pressures from interest groups and
governments in developed countries. From this per-
spective, the contribution of high environmental stan-
dards to bottom-line performance is “coincidental”:
The effect would not be present were it not for societal
pressures to develop more environmentally friendly
technologies and equipment. One would expect early
movers to see the biggest gains from such invest-
ments, as Nehrt (1996) reports. Over time, companies
not able to keep up with the investments would
evidence erosion in bottom-line performance and ﬁrm
value.14

A second, internally driven mechanism may also be
at work, however. Firms that adopt high environmen-
tal standards are those that strive for eco-efﬁcient
production systems. The conscious policy to pursue
technologies and processes that increase the resource

14 However, this is not a typical “equilibrium” perspective. At
equilibrium, the value of the above investment should reﬂect the
value of cash ﬂow and thus should not affect Tobin’s q.

productivity of their operations has a positive result
for the bottom line.15

Low Performers Race to the Bottom
Tobin’s q can be interpreted as a measure of ﬁrm
“quality” (e.g., better-managed ﬁrms are higher-value
ﬁrms). One can therefore interpret our results as
suggesting that “quality” ﬁrms adopt high environ-
mental standards independent of local requirements,
and generate less pollution, while lower-quality ﬁrms
engage in a “race to the bottom,” as a means of gaining
short term ﬁnancial advantage. High “quality” ﬁrms
are typically more focused on corporate goals and
competitive position. The application of a stringent
global environmental standard may be indicative of a
desire to build organizational awareness amongst all
afﬁliates, of company policies and practices. It may
also be an indicator that a company, as an industry
leader, aims to stay on top in all aspects of its business.
There are still other possible explanations for the
linkage between ﬁrm quality and ﬁrm environmental
standard. For example, it is possible that better ﬁrms
have the foresight to plan for the future: They see the
importance of applying high environmental standards
even where not required because the standards will
increase as a region grows and develops. It is also
possible that higher-quality ﬁrms simply have the
resources to invest in higher environment standards.
They use environmental performance as a competitive
weapon against other ﬁrms with fewer resources or
means to keep up.

7. Conclusion
This paper refutes the idea that adoption of global
environmental standards by MNEs constitutes a lia-
bility that depresses market value. On the contrary,
the evidence from our analysis indicates that positive
market valuation is associated with the adoption of a

15 An extension of our argument is that developing countries offer
particularly attractive locations to experiment with such “clean
technology” because they are not subject to the same level of costly
“command and control” regulation that is found in developed
economies such as the United States. Indeed, under these circum-
stances, it may be possible for ﬁrms to jointly optimize cost, quality,
and environmental performance.

Corporate Global Environmental Standards and Market Value

single stringent environmental standard around the
world.

Our results imply that private valuations may in-
corporate negative environmental externalities, even if
the externalities take place in countries with lax envi-
ronmental regulations and poorly protected environ-
mental property rights. In addition, adopting stringent
environmental standards may actually be more prof-
itable than defaulting to lower local environmental
standards. This may be a by-product of pressures in
the developed world to make new technologies and
equipment more environmentally friendly. It may also
be that environmentally conscious ﬁrms are more
diligent in reducing waste and improving resource
productivity.

The notion that MNE’s, as a group, pursue the
lowest environmental standards and create a “race to
the bottom” among developing countries desperate
for foreign investments is not substantiated by the
data. The most common corporate environmental
practice in our sample is the opposite: adopting a
stringent internal standard globally. We do not, how-
ever, suggest that the race to the bottom does not exist.
In fact, our ﬁndings also suggest that companies with
lower market values tend to pursue lower environ-
mental standards. Perhaps these companies opt to
default to host country standards because they lack
the means to make the investment in environmentally
superior technology worldwide. They may also be less
well-run companies focusing on short-term cost sav-
ings. This might include, but is certainly not limited to,
strategies such as recapitalizing old production assets,
extending obsolete product life cycles, and exploiting
low labor costs.

From a public policy standpoint, then, there are
clear implications regarding these results: Developing
countries may indeed attract foreign investment by
lowering environmental standards, but the type of
companies they attract by doing so will be weaker
(and more pollution-intensive) ﬁrms not investing in
state-of-the-art plants and equipment. After a tempo-
rary presence marked by the exploitation of the lower
or poorly enforced host country standards, these com-
panies may well end up fodder for those globally
competitive ﬁrms which have adopted worldwide

environmental standards and are reaping the compet-
itive and market beneﬁts of that policy. Thus, devel-
oping countries may be best served by promoting
aggressive environmental objectives combined with a
willingness to work collaboratively with the world’s
leading MNEs to deﬁne and implement policies that
facilitate “win-win” environmental solutions.

The most important conclusion suggested by our
results is that higher “quality” ﬁrms (as measured by
Tobin’s q) appear to pollute less. Future research
should examine this relationship in greater depth.
Two future directions appear evident. First, our study
was constrained by data availability. Future research
should supplement the current data with more vari-
ables, including ﬁrm reputation, more detailed infor-
mation on ﬁrms’ actual environmental practices and
performance, and a longer time series. Second, future
work should aim to identify why ﬁrms adopt higher
environmental standards. While we have proposed
several plausible explanations here, examination of
their validity awaits further research.16

Appendix: Validation of IRRC Environmental
Standard Measure
In this study, the focal independent variables are derived from the
Investor Responsibility Research Center’s (IRRC) Corporate Envi-
ronmental Proﬁle. The IRRC contains a record of each corporation’s
declared stance regarding its international environmental standard:
(1) the corporation adheres to local standards only; (2) the corpora-
tion applies U.S. environmental standards wherever it does busi-
ness; and (3) the corporation has its own internal environmental
standard that exceeds any national standards. The assumption is
that ﬁrms declaring a lower category of environmental standard are
poorer environmental performers.

This assumption requires validation. Full-scale validation is dif-
ﬁcult because consistent and reliable pollution data at the plant level
on a global scale do not exist, especially in developing countries. We
therefore resorted to validating this assumption based on each
ﬁrm’s U.S. “Toxic Release Inventory” (TRI) data, as reported in

1995.17 The IRRC (Investor Responsibility Research Center) tracks
U.S. plants’ toxic releases (by weight) and reports for each company
its ratio of toxic releases to sales and industry average. We created
a variable, “relative emissions,” which is the difference between a
ﬁrm’s U.S. toxic release/sales and industry average. We then
examined how “relative emissions” varies with a company’s de-
clared environmental standard. To determine the robustness of our
results, we trimmed outliers that had student residuals greater than
or equal to three.

Table A1 reports the mean “relative emissions” by each declared
class of environmental standard. The result is consistent with our
expectation: Firms defaulting to “local standards” (Group 1) have
the highest relative emissions, while ﬁrms applying “an internal
global standard that exceeds any national standard” (Group 3) have
the lowest relative emissions. Firms applying U.S. standards over-
seas (Group 2) were in between these two extremes.

We also conducted a regression analysis. Notice that we did not
need to control for industrywide effects because the pollution
measure has been standardized by industry average. We controlled
for ﬁrm size (log of total dollars of assets) because of possible
economies (or diseconomies) of scale in “polluting.” The regression
analysis is reported in Table A2. The results are consistent with
those in Table A1: (i) ﬁrms that “default to local environmental
standards” pollute statistically signiﬁcantly more than ﬁrms that
apply “an internal global standard;” (ii) ﬁrms that “default to local
environmental standards” pollute more than ﬁrms that apply “U.S.
standards,” but the difference is not statistically signiﬁcant; and (iii)

17 We have data for both 1994 and 1995. Using 1994 data generates
similar results that are slightly less signiﬁcant but still acceptable.
We chose to use the 1995 data because our records on corporate
environmental standards for 1995 are more complete.

The overall model is signiﬁcant at the 5% level (F-value ⫽ 2.728)
Numbers in parentheses are standard errors.

ﬁrms that apply “U.S. standards” pollute more than ﬁrms that apply
“an internal global standard,” but the difference is not statistically
signiﬁcant.

While the tests are relatively simple, they provide evidence that
our Environmental Standard variable is valid and meaningful:
Companies using a global environmental standard are relatively
cleaner in the United States than those companies defaulting to host
country standards abroad. This is especially signiﬁcant because
companies that default to host country standards can, by deﬁnition,
export their dirtiest processes to lax jurisdictions, an option that is
not open to companies using a single global standard.
