Two research questions are addressed in this article. First, does technological competence
enhance ﬁrm performance. Second, does competitor imitation of ﬁrm knowledge hurt perfor-
mance. The relationships between technological competence, imitability and performance are
basic premises in the resource-based view, yet there has been little empirical testing of them.
Measures of technological competence and imitability are developed. These variables, together
with measures of marketing and regulatory competence, are tested for their impact on ﬁrm per-
formance in the pharmaceutical industry. Imitability has a negative and signiﬁcant impact on
accounting and market-based performance measures. Contrary to expectations, technological
competence is inversely related to market-based performance measures and positively related
to accounting measures. Research and managerial implications for the ﬁndings are discussed.

When it comes to core competencies, it is difﬁcult to get off the train, walk to the next
station, and then reboard.

–Prahalad and Hamel (1990: 85)
This quote from the article by Prahalad and Hamel succinctly allegorizes the relation-
ship between organizational knowledge and core competencies. Core competencies are
the embodiment of organizational knowledge, built up over time and not easily imitated
(Leonard-Barton, 1995; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) that yield a competitive advantage. Core
competencies represent an accumulation of knowledge as organizations learn, actualize
that learning in competencies, and deploy those competencies in their product–market

strategies. Competencies are typically so embedded in an organization that to acquire a
different “bundle” of competencies entails a signiﬁcant investment in terms of resources,
such as capital, people, and managerial vision—hence, the virtual impossibility of “boarding
the next train.”

This is particularly true with respect to ﬁrms whose competencies are technologically
based, competing on the basis of a technological advantage as opposed to competing on
the basis of marketing adeptness, distribution access or ownership of natural resources.
Developing and sustaining technological competencies is important to continuous innova-
tion in these ﬁrms. Many recent perspectives of ﬁrm behavior such as the resource-based
view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), dynamics capabilities (Teece, Pisano & Shuen,
1997) and knowledge-based view (Kogut & Zander, 1992) suggest that ﬁrm competen-
cies are stocks of knowledge (De Carolis & Deeds, 1999; Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Lev &
Sougiannis, 1999) accumulated over time, difﬁcult for competitors to replicate, and are the
source of competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Reed & DeFillippi,
1990; Wernerfelt, 1984).

A related stream of literature proposes that core competencies can become core rigidities
(Leonard-Barton, 1995). Core rigidities are the opposite of core competencies; they are
strengths that evolve into weaknesses. A technological competence may become a liability
if it prevents the ﬁrm from expanding outside a particular knowledge trajectory to sustain
competitive advantage. Core rigidities prevent new competencies from being developed or
from maintaining the right balance of competencies.

For core competencies to yield a competitive advantage, they must be inimitable—costly
or difﬁcult for competitors to imitate. Barney (2001) stresses that imitability is the most
important concept to emerge from the resource-based view. Imitability explains competitive
advantage in equilibrium and this is what is most new about the resource-based view. Barney
(2001) further claims that the empirical assertions derived from this concept are “. . . likely
to be among the most important to come out of resource-based theory” (Barney, 2001: 45).
However, there has been little empirical research on the construct of imitability.

This article investigates two related research questions motivated by the resource-based
view. First, do technological competencies make a difference in ﬁrm performance and,
second, does competitor imitation of technological competencies hurt a given ﬁrm’s per-
formance. A ﬁrm’s performance, even in technologically intensive industries, does not rely
solely on technological expertise. Competencies in areas such as marketing, general man-
agement, human resource management, and dealing effectively with external stakeholders
and government entities may be critical to competitive advantage (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990).
To address these questions, hypotheses are developed, based on the resource-based view
of the ﬁrm, about the relationship between competencies, imitability and performance and
tested in the pharmaceutical industry.

This article makes several contributions to the growing literature on competencies and
the resource-based view of the ﬁrm. First, addressing a gap in previous studies, this arti-
cle investigates the impact of three different types of competencies on ﬁrm performance.
This extension of previous empirical work was recently suggested by Lev and Sougiannis
(1999) who call for examination of the performance implications of various assets such as
marketing related competencies. Second, this paper develops a measure of technological
competence that captures building on prior knowledge. This adds to the growing literature

on measuring stocks of knowledge (see for example Cockburn & Griliches, 1988; Hall, Jaffe
& Trajtenberg, 2000; Lev & Sougiannis, 1999). Third, although the concept of imitability
is central to the resource-based perspective, again, a review of the empirical literature in
this area reveals that this construct has not been operationalized nor has its relationship with
ﬁrm performance been assessed. Fourth, I empirically examine the impact of competencies
on accounting and market-based measures of ﬁrm performance, again addressing a gap in
the resource-based literature. Finally, the empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data
and this type of dynamic research wherein the conditions under which competencies are
developed under one period have implications for subsequent periods is appropriate for
examining resource-based theory (Barney, 2001).

The article begins with a brief exposition of the role of competencies and imitability
in the context of the pharmaceutical industry. This is followed by the development of the
model and hypothesis. The following sections describe the methodology, the data, and the
construction of the variables. The paper then turns to a description of the results and closes
with a discussion of their strategic implications for managers and suggestions for future
research.

Competencies and Competitive Advantage

The term “competence” as used in the management literature generally conveys the notion
that a ﬁrm possesses a degree of expertise and excellence in one or more particular areas
compared to its competitors that results in a competitive advantage. In the numerous articles
on competencies that have appeared in the past 20 years or so, the particular nomenclature
for the “resources that yield competitive advantage” has varied greatly. Probably the term
used most frequently is “core competence,” popularized by Prahalad and Hamel (1990). A
review of the literature reveals that several concepts have emerged in lieu of or in addition
to the term core competence or competence. The most commonly used terms are: resources,
strategic assets, competencies, core competencies, capabilities, and core capabilities. Table 1
outlines these terms and the various authors that have used them.

This table reveals that early deﬁnitions of competence were somewhat general in nature.
The term has evolved into a richer concept that explains “how” ﬁrms do things better. The
table also illustrates how some of the same terms are used to describe different ideas. I use
the term competence as distinct from capabilities, concurring with the differences noted
by Henderson and Cockburn (1994) and Leonard-Barton (1992). In this article the term
competence is used to denote the local abilities, knowledge and skills and technical systems
of a ﬁrm that may yield a competitive advantage.

A review of the empirical studies in the competence literature reveal two gaps in the
literature that are addressed in this article. First, competence is measured in various ways
by different researchers. Competence has been operationalized by survey instruments of ex-
cellence in functional areas (Hitt & Ireland, 1985; Hitt, Ireland & Palia, 1982; Hitt, Ireland
& Stadter, 1982; Snow & Hrebiniak, 1980); by using ﬁnancial measures of intensity such
as the ratio of research and development to sales, advertising to sales and administrative
intensity (Chatterjee & Wernerfelt, 1991; Harrison, Hitt, Hoskisson & Ireland, 1991); by re-
latedness among business units (Markides & Williamson, 1996; Robins & Wiersema, 1995);

and by property based vs. knowledge-based resources (Miller & Shamsie, 1996). However,
few studies (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994) speciﬁcally measure technological competence
as building on a ﬁrm’s stock of knowledge.

Second, relatively few studies have actually tested the relationship between different com-
petencies and ﬁnancial performance. This is due in large part to deﬁnitional and operational
issues. There exist many deﬁnitions of competence representing different levels of analysis.
Moreover, it is difﬁcult to measure competencies on an aggregate level. Some scholars have
used the case study approach to document the link between competencies and competitive
advantage (Collis, 1991; Leonard-Barton, 1992). Henderson and Cockburn (1994) studied
the relationship among competencies and research productivity. Chatterjee and Wernerfelt
(1991) examined the link between resource proﬁles and diversiﬁcation types. Thus, there
appears a gap in the literature on actually measuring the direct impact of speciﬁc compe-
tencies such as technological, regulatory and marketing on ﬁrm performance. One of the
purposes of this investigation is to ﬁll that gap and empirically investigate the impact of
speciﬁc competencies on ﬁrm performance.

Competencies and Imitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry

The context of the pharmaceutical industry provides an appropriate domain for this study
since it is a technologically dynamic industry. Discovery of new drugs and their success-
ful commercialization drive performance. Three types of competencies are valuable in this
industry: technological, marketing and regulatory (Bogner & Thomas, 1994). The value
of a ﬁrm’s resources is determined by the context of the speciﬁc market in which it is
operating. This makes the value component of the resource-based view exogenously de-
termined (Barney, 2001; Priem & Butler, 2001). Technological, marketing and regulatory
competencies are valuable in the context of the pharmaceutical industry (Bogner & Thomas,
1994; Cool & Schendel, 1988; Henderson & Cockburn, 1994, 1988; Hill & Hansen, 1991;
Thomas, 1990).

Technological competencies in pharmaceuticals are a function of expertise in scientiﬁc
discipline and therapeutic area. The traditional scientiﬁc knowledge base for pharmaceuti-
cal companies has been organic chemistry and pharmacology. However, biotechnology is
affecting the technology of drug research and the capabilities of established pharmaceutical
companies since its knowledge bases are found in genetics, molecular biology and protein
chemistry (Pisano, 1997).

Research skills in pharmaceuticals are interpreted relative to the various therapeutic
classes of drugs that exist (Bogner & Thomas, 1994). Pharmaceutical ﬁrms have gener-
ally pursued capabilities in particular therapeutic areas so as to become experts in certain
ﬁelds. One of the factors contributing to this drive for competence in speciﬁc areas is that
the preponderance of relatively “easy” pharmacological discoveries has already been made
(Economist, 1997; Langreth, 1995; Tanouye & Langreth, 1997). It is becoming more difﬁ-
cult for pharmaceutical companies to ﬁnd entirely new drugs. During the 1960s and 1970s
there were many breakthrough medicines to treat heart disease, depression, arthritis and
other diseases. New Drug Applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) peaked
in 1983 to 270 from 120 in 1978. Subsequently, new discoveries became harder to ﬁnd

as evidenced by the decline in New Drug Applications—86 in 1993 (Economist, 1997;
Langreth, 1995; Tanouye & Langreth, 1997).

On the other hand, pursing new products in one therapeutic area can enhance learning in
other areas. Allen, Lee and Tushman (1980) and Katz (1988) suggest that in technology-
driven environments intra-organizational
learning enhances research performance.
Henderson and Cockburn (1994) also ﬁnd that a ﬂow of information across the bound-
aries of the ﬁrm is related to research productivity. Moreover, a strategy of strictly pursing
certain therapeutic classes could be too limiting and most ﬁrms look into other therapeutic
areas to develop competencies and broader pipelines or portfolios of potential drugs.

The durability of a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage is partly a function of how successfully
other ﬁrms are able to imitate the focal ﬁrm’s technological competence. Unsuccessful
imitation does not erode the focal ﬁrm’s competitive advantage. However, when a ﬁrm’s
technological competencies are being imitated, then competitive advantage will not last
long. This is certainly true in many industries and perhaps is even more critical in the
pharmaceutical industry. Research and development costs in this industry are somewhere
between US$400 and US$500 million dollars and it takes approximately 10 years to bring
a drug to market (MedAd News, 1999). Pharmaceutical companies patent a new chemical
entity at the time of discovery affording them some protection. By the time the development
process is completed and FDA approval is achieved, a signiﬁcant portion of the patent
protection is gone. This has important implications for innovation in this industry. Once a
patent is granted, the knowledge contained in that patent is public. This reinforces the fact
that learning must be ongoing, as imitation will eventually erode ﬁrm speciﬁc innovation.
Therefore, new learning even in the same areas is critical for survival.

Effectively dealing with the FDA is another valuable resource. The approval process for
new drugs is costly and lengthy. The ﬁnal submission of the New Drug Application (NDA)
averages about 50,000 pages. The review process can take anywhere from several months
to several years. (There is an exception in the case of “high priority drugs” such as cancer
or AIDS treatments that are usually approved/disapproved within 12 or so months.)

Finally, pharmaceutical companies need to effectively market their new products. The
success of some drugs, particularly those in the same category such as high blood pressure
drugs, depends on how well a company can differentiate that drug particularly to physicians.
The market share and revenues of a particular drug depend in large part on a strong and edu-
cated marketing and sales team. Thus, the context of pharmaceuticals provides a rich arena
in which to examine the effect of technological, marketing and regulatory competencies on
ﬁrm performance.

Theoretical Model and Hypotheses

Technological Competence and Firm Performance

The premise that unique ﬁrm capabilities are critical to ﬁrm performance has been ad-
dressed in many streams of literature: resource-based models of ﬁrm behavior (Barney, 1991;
Wernerfelt, 1984) organizational learning theories (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Fiol & Lyles,
1985); knowledge-based perspectives of the ﬁrm; (Kogut & Zander, 1992) evolutionary

economics (Nelson & Winter, 1982) and the dynamic capabilities perspective (Teece et al.,
1997).

A natural trajectory of knowledge is embedded in a ﬁrm’s competencies. Knowledge has
been deﬁned as the creation and organization of information, based on the commitments
and beliefs of its holder (Nonaka, 1994). This explanation of knowledge is consistent with
the notion that ﬁrms operate within certain technological paradigms (Dosi, 1982). Most
innovations are not radical or discontinuous in the sense that they make obsolete existing
organizational capabilities (Tushman & Anderson, 1986). Radical innovations are based on
new science and create new markets. Most innovations are incremental in nature, building on
already existing ﬁrm knowledge. Incremental innovations involve the adaptation, reﬁnement
and enhancement of existing products, services and/or production processes. Firms typically
compete with incremental innovations and will increase their learning and knowledge in
that particular technological dominant design.

Technological competencies consist of knowledge and skills embedded in people and
knowledge embedded in technical systems (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Technical systems are
the manifestations of years of accumulating, codifying and structuring the tacit knowledge
embodied in people. These competencies can become institutionalized. That is, they are part
of organizational assumptions that guide strategic decision-making. Technology embedded
in technical systems and people skills typically can be traced back to the ﬁrm’s ﬁrst products
or services. Dominant logic (Bettis & Prahalad, 1986) refers to the general management
mindset that pervades the ﬁrm by producing a world-view governing decision-making pro-
cesses and strategies. This dominant logic is also applicable to organizational knowledge
as deﬁned above.

In the pharmaceutical industry, ﬁrms usually develop an expertise in both scientiﬁc
and therapeutic areas. Advances and learning in both areas are critical in new drug
discovery and development (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994). Specialized learning over
time reinforces the competencies and patterns of interactions that bear successful
solutions.

Firms may learn and develop technological competencies in many ways. As ﬁrms work
in a particular technological regime, they innovate in the sense that knowledge is combined
to create improvements in a product or incorporate new functions into a product. These
incremental improvements may duplicate a competence or re-combine internal knowledge
or incorporate either new internally developed knowledge or newly acquired external knowl-
edge into the existing product. A ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity, the learning that occurs through
absorption of external knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) is a critical concept in un-
derstanding competence building. Firms may acquire external knowledge and apply this
knowledge to their own understanding. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) also emphasize that
ﬁrms absorb and incorporate new knowledge that is related to their existing knowledge
bases. The re-combining of internal capabilities to produce new knowledge is a central
focus in the knowledge-based theory of the ﬁrm (Kogut & Zander, 1992).

The creation of technological competencies is theoretically linked to competitive advan-
tage (Barney, 2001; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990; Leonard-Barton, 1995). In particular, many
studies address the importance of unique technological competencies to be strategically
signiﬁcant in science and technology-driven industries (Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Henderson
& Cockburn, 1994).


D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50

35

There does exist a downside to building on ﬁrm knowledge, what Leonard-Barton (1992)
calls “core rigidities.” Core rigidities may result from the institutionalization of knowledge
and routines so that new concepts and technologies are not taken seriously. Firms see only
their competencies as being valuable and do not consider alternative innovations as having
commercialization possibility. Yet, accumulated ﬁrm knowledge is the prime ingredient
in technological competence as ﬁrms operate in particular technological paradigms. The
manifestation of technological competencies is the ability of ﬁrms to become “experts” in
what they do through the enhancement over time of organizational knowledge. The building
of stocks of knowledge leads to the development of competencies.

Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive relationship between technological competence

and ﬁrm performance.

Imitability and Firm Performance

Imitability refers to the extent to which rivals can imitate a competence. The construct of
imitability has received the most theoretical attention by scholars (Dierickx & Cool, 1989;
Reed & DeFillippi, 1990) and the empirical assertions derived from this concept (Barney,
2001) are likely to be among the most important emanating from the resource-based view.
This is due to its theoretical relationship with sustained competitive advantage. Of course,
competitive advantage can be sustained in many ways and under different conditions (Reed
& DeFillippi, 1990). Such a theoretical and empirical undertaking is beyond the scope
of this paper. Yet, the discussion of the role of imitability in competitive advantage is
well delineated in the literature and, as such, is central to the discussion of competitive
advantage.

A ﬁrm’s technological competencies may be inimitable (Barney, 1991; Prahalad &
Hamel, 1990; Wernerfelt, 1984) and may be disseminated in a variety of ways. Levin et al.
(1984) identiﬁed several methods of spillover: patent disclosures, publications, technical
meetings, conversations between employees of competing ﬁrms, hiring of employees from
rival ﬁrms, and reverse engineering of products. With respect to patents, there are numerous
articles that support the notion that the value of the knowledge contained in patents does
spill over to other ﬁrms who cite those patents. The theoretical and empirical literature in
the innovation area suggests that patent citations are in fact a form of knowledge spillover
(Trajtenberg, 1990). This literature also suggests that highly cited patents are the most in-
novative as other ﬁrms are vying to imitate their ideas (Carpenter & Narin, 1983; Narin,
Rose & Olivastro, 1989; Trajtenberg, 1990).

However, there is little literature on the effect of this imitation on the “cited” ﬁrm. In
other words, if the originator of a valuable innovation is being imitated (in the case of
patents, “cited”), then there should be a detrimental effect on the ﬁrm’s competitive advan-
tage. Rival ﬁrms are appropriating their knowledge and their commercial success from that
knowledge.

In the pharmaceutical industry, knowledge spillovers may be beneﬁcial to research pro-
ductivity. Henderson and Cockburn (1996) suggest that knowledge spillovers produce a
positive effect on research productivity if the knowledge is complementary. However, when
rival research efforts are substitutes, there would be a negative effect on research produc-


36

tivity. Moreover, even though pharmaceutical companies can license their patents to other
ﬁrms, they receive no income when other ﬁrms cite their patents in subsequent patents.

Appropriability—the ability of a ﬁrm to capture the proﬁts generated by an innovation—
is inﬂuenced by legal mechanisms such as patents, copyrights and trade secrets and also by
the nature of the underlying technology, that is, the extent to which knowledge is tacit or
codiﬁed (Teece, 1986). If an innovation is easily imitated, then a ﬁrm may not be able to
appropriate the returns from that innovation. A weak appropriability regime (Teece, 1986)
lessens the chances that an innovator will proﬁt from an innovation.

In pharmaceuticals the long lead-time between the patenting of a new molecular entity
and its ﬁnal commercialization can result in patent expiration before the commercialization
(Pisano, 1997). Moreover, this lead-time may be even shorter in that once a patent is issued,
the information becomes public knowledge. Rival ﬁrms have the opportunity to circumvent
issued patents and imitate the knowledge generated in those innovations. Thus, it should be
true that if a ﬁrm’s knowledge is imitated, its performance will diminish.

Hypothesis 2: Imitability of ﬁrm knowledge has an inverse relationship with ﬁrm per-

formance.

Marketing Competencies and Firm Performance

As mentioned above, ﬁrms may possess several types of competencies. Conceptually,
a marketing competence refers to a ﬁrm’s ability to develop and maintain relationships
with customers, the ability to use market intelligence about external factors that might in-
ﬂuence current and future customer needs and also the quality of channel relationships
(Mooreman & Slotegraaf, 1999). Marketing competencies are proposed to be just as im-
portant to ﬁrm performance (Cool & Schendel, 1987). Current marketing literature, based
on resource-based theory, suggests that a ﬁrm’s marketing competency will have a direct
inﬂuence on performance (Day, 1994; Hunt & Morgan, 1995; Mooreman & Slotegraaf,
1999).

In the pharmaceutical industry, the deployment of strong marketing capabilities impacts
the success of new drugs. Pharmaceutical companies rely on highly trained sales forces to
represent their products to doctors, health care systems and managed care networks. Phar-
maceutical representatives are intensely trained so as to be knowledgeable about the drugs
being promoted to their various customers. Pharmaceutical companies track the prescribing
habits of individual physicians through pharmacies to obtain data on which physicians are
prescribing particular drugs. A strong marketing competence can make a tremendous dif-
ference in market share for drugs of the same type. Several studies have empirically linked
the positive effects of advertising on ﬁrm performance (Chauvin & Hirschey, 1993; Jose,
Nichols & Stevens, 1986; Lustgarten & Thomadkis, 1987; Morck, Shleifer & Vishny, 1988).
In the management literature, the importance of resources such as marketing and innovative
skills is closely linked to ﬁrm performance (Bettis, 1981; Chatterjee & Wernerfelt, 1991).

Hypothesis 3: Marketing competencies have a positive relationship with ﬁrm

performance.

Regulatory Competencies and Firm Performance

Barney (1986) suggests that assets required to implement a strategy might be bought and
sold in factor markets. As Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out, however, this is not true of
all assets. Consider for example, the instance of corporate reputation, dealer loyalty or the
ability to deal proﬁciently with governmental agencies. Dierickx and Cool (1989) suggest
that assets such as these are nonappropriable. Their nonappropriability derives from many
sources such as the absence of deﬁned property rights, loyalty or trust. These assets are
built or accumulated over time. Firms will engage in a consistent pattern of activities over
long periods of time to accumulate such competencies.

As mentioned previously, throughout the drug development process, a pharmaceutical
company must maintain constant communication with the FDA, which has oversight author-
ity over the clinical trials, ﬁnal approval and manufacturing of any drugs. Pharmaceutical
companies are required to ﬁle an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application with the
FDA that must be approved prior to the commencement of clinical trials. They also need
to prepare and ﬁle a (NDA) with the FDA for ﬁnal approval to manufacture and market a
new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have entire staffs devoted to dealing with the FDA.
Developing an expertise in the preparation and completion of the required documentation
for the drug approval process and establishing a relationship with the FDA, is critical to
product commercialization in the pharmaceutical industry (Cool & Schendel, 1988).

These relationships and expertise in communicating with the FDA are attributable to the
accumulation of expertise in this area, to time compression diseconomies (Dierickx & Cool,
1989), to tacit knowledge, to complexity and to asset speciﬁcity (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990).
There exists a tremendous human component in maintaining a successful relationship with
an external agency. It involves a degree of tacitness, that is, development by experience
and practice that is hard to codify. It is characterized by complexity—consisting of large
numbers of organizational routines and individual or team based experiences. A regulatory
competence is necessary to maintain harmonious relationships with governmental agencies
(Hitt & Ireland, 1985). Thus, in addition to technological knowledge and marketing compe-
tencies, a proﬁciency in documentation and ﬁling for the FDA and a working relationship
with this agency is an important competency in the pharmaceutical industry.

Hypothesis 4: Regulatory competencies have a positive relationship with ﬁrm perfor-

mance.

Measuring Technological Competence and Imitability

Technological competence involves building a stock of knowledge. Most of the previous
research that has attempted to measure technological competence has been case study or
anecdotal evidence (Bogner & Thomas, 1994; Collis, 1991; Grant, 1991; Leonard-Barton,
1992; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990). New measures of technological competence and imitability
are advanced using a variation of patent citation analysis. Before the actual measure used
is described, the general technique of patent citation analysis is explained.


38

D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50

Patent citations are references delineated on the front page of every patent that refer to
prior patents. Every new patent relies on knowledge developed in past patents, much in
the same way that advances in management literature cites previous research. When ﬁrms
develop new inventions and patent these inventions, they will cite prior “state of the art.”
The front page of a patent contains demographic information as well as a section titled
“References Cited.” In this section, prior patents that provided the knowledge relied on for
the current patent are listed. Citation analysis involves the selection of certain patents and
then scrutinizing subsequent patents to assess how many times they are cited.

Patent citations are worthy indicators of technological competence for two reasons. First,
they are objective. Patent citations are not quoted at the whim of the inventor. The patent
examiner, together with the inventor and the inventor’s attorney, arrive at a ﬁnal list of
citations for every patent and this list limits the scope of property rights of the patent owner
and is protected by law. Thus, there is an incentive for all parties to cite the relevant state
of the art (Campbell & Nieves, 1979; Trajtenberg, 1990).

Second, patent citations are indicators of valuable technological knowledge. A patent that
is highly cited is one that is regarded as having greater than average impact. Clearly, patent
citation analysis is an improvement over simple patent counts that do not capture the quality
of a patent. Other studies (Carpenter & Narin, 1983; Narin et al., 1989; Trajtenberg, 1990)
empirically establish the validity of patent citation analysis as indicators of technological
competence. In a recent study, Hall et al. (2000) ﬁnd that citation weighted patent stocks
are more highly correlated with market value than stocks of patents themselves.

Self-citation Analysis

Earlier works have measured stocks of knowledge and have operationalized the stock
of knowledge with patent data (De Carolis & Deeds, 1999; Henderson & Cockburn, 1994,
1996). Patents are one manifestation of ﬁrm knowledge. The learning that occurs to pro-
duce the innovation contained in the patent—whether that learning be acquired through
combining existing internal knowledge or combining existing internal knowledge with new
internal knowledge—is represented on that patent. Patents embody stocks of accumulated
knowledge—not just from 1 or 2 years but also from many years.

Extending these prior empirical applications, this study suggests that a ﬁrm’s ability to
build on its knowledge is manifested by the frequency with which it cites its own inventive
activities on its issued patents. In the present study, this is measured using a variation of
patent citation analysis that is identiﬁed as “self-citation analysis.” That is, a ﬁrm’s refer-
ences to its prior patents on its subsequent patents are representative of building knowl-
edge stocks. This approach is analogous to bibliographic author counts that are indicators
of how frequently researchers in the natural and social sciences are quoted. Researchers
who cite their past work, build knowledge within particular areas and become experts
in those areas. This same reasoning is applied to patent references. Thus, the method
used in this study to represent a ﬁrm’s stock of knowledge is patent self-citation analy-
sis. Similarly, imitability may be measured by assessing how frequently other companies
cite a particular ﬁrm’s knowledge, again obtained from patent data. It is expected that the
value of a ﬁrm’s knowledge is diluted as more and more companies try to mimic that
knowledge.

Methodology

In addition to the reasons discussed above for choosing the pharmaceutical industry
as the domain of this study, testing the model is tested in a single industry over multiple
points in time rather than in multiple industries controls for industry effects. Patent data was
obtained from Computer Horizons Inc. (CHI) and the sample consists of 14 pharmaceutical
companies that represent major global ﬁrms, were in the top 40 of annual US pharmaceutical
sales in at least one of the sampled years and have been used extensively in previous research.
These companies are: Abbott Labs, American Home Products, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli
Lilly, Glaxo, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Monsanto, Pﬁzer, Schering-Plough, Smith Kline
Beecham, Syntex, Upjohn and Warner Lambert.

Measures

Descriptions of the measures used for the independent and dependent variables are given
below. Measures for technological competence and imitability, are derived from a patent
database developed by CHI. The database obtained by this author included selected infor-
mation on patents and patent citations for each of the pharmaceutical companies for the
years 1985–1991.

Technological competence (Techcomp). This variable is calculated as follows: Company
A had issued “N” number of patents during a given year. Within 2 years of their issue date,
“M” patents had cited these “N” patents. Of these “M” citations, “X” patents belonged to
Company A—self-citing. The ratio of X/N is the measure used for technological competence.

Imitability (Imitability). Similar to the self-cite measure, this was calculated as follows:
Company A had issued “N” number of patents during a given year. Within 2 years of their
issue date, “M” patents had cited these “N” patents. Of these “M” citations, “Y” patents
were by other companies. The ratio of Y/N is the measure used for Imitability.

Marketing competence (Ad/Sales). Relative advertising expenditures is used measured
as the total advertising expenditures divided by total sales for a given year. This information
was obtained from Compustat. Previous studies have utilized levels of spending intensity as
proxies for marketing skills (Bettis, 1981; Chatterjee & Wernerfelt, 1991; Lecraw, 1984).

Regulatory competency (Approval). This construct is operationalized as the number
of new drugs per year per ﬁrm. Pharmaceutical companies may develop a reputation for
dealing effectively with the FDA. This expertise should be reﬂected in the amount of new
drug approvals per year. New drugs categorized as Type A drugs or high priority drugs
were used as the basis for this measure. Type A drugs as deﬁned by the FDA Pink Sheets,
represent totally new chemical entities; thus they embody the culmination of the ﬁrm’s
developing knowledge.

Research and development expenditures (RD/Sales). Research and development expen-
ditures have been used as a proxy for innovation, competence or technological strength


40

D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50

(Hill & Snell, 1988; Jensen, 1987). The assumption is that more funds committed to R&D
the more chances a ﬁrm has to be innovative. An alternative view (Grabowski & Vernon,
1990; Graves & Langowitz, 1993; McClean & Round, 1978; Scherer, 1965) suggests that
increased R&D expenditures in fact lead to a decline in innovation. Given the inconsistent
results of prior research on the effects of research and development on ﬁrm performance
(Henderson & Cockburn, 1996) it is included as a control variable here. It is measured as
the ratio of research and development expenditures to total sales and data was obtained from
Compustat.

Size (Assets). The size of the pharmaceutical company measured as total assets is in-

cluded as a control variable. All data was obtained from Compustat.

Total number of patents (Patents). This variable, measured, as the total number of patents
granted to a pharmaceutical company per year, is included as a control variable. Single patent
counts have correlated with innovativeness in prior empirical studies.

Firm age (Age). Sorensen and Stuart (2000) found that age had implications for innova-
tive activities for ﬁrms. Speciﬁcally, they found that the tendency of a ﬁrm to cite their own
patents increases with ﬁrm age. In this study, conﬁned to one industry, most of the ﬁrms
will be of relatively similar age. However, ﬁrm age is included as a control variable here,
acknowledging the effect found by Sorensen and Stuart (2000).

Performance (ROA & MKBK). Performance is measured using return on assets (ROA)
and market to book value (MB). There are several reasons for using both measures. First,
proﬁtability measures are frequently used in the strategy literature. Previous research in the
resource-based view has also empirically examined proﬁtability measures as a function of
competencies (Bierly & Chakrabarati, 1996; Harrison et al., 1991; Markides & Williamson,
1994, 1996).

This investigation is also part of the patents-performance literature that spans the disci-
plines of strategy, economics and ﬁnance. Within these streams, many studies have explored
the relationship between innovation and market value using patent data (Deng, Lev & Narin,
1999; Hausman, Hall & Griliches, 1984; Hall, 1998; Hall et al., 2000). In the tradition of
these literatures, market to book value is also used a performance measure. Market to book
values captures the market valuation of a ﬁrm’s total assets, both tangible and intangible,
relative to an accounting valuation—the book value of assets. Market to book captures fu-
ture economic returns whereas return on assets captures current returns (Mueller, 1990).
Compustat is the source for both performance measures.

Analysis

Since the data covers 7 years, this study employs a time-series cross sectional regression
analysis. The particular technique used is TSCS REG found in SAS. The model under
investigation consists of observations of the same units several times and the observations
may not be statistically independent. The biases associated with this speciﬁcation are serial
and contemporaneous correlation of the residuals and heteroskedasticity. The modiﬁed GLS

41

estimation technique by Parks (1967) takes into account three sources of bias under these
assumptions. The ﬁrst is serial correlation which assumes that the error terms within cross
sections are more highly correlated in years 1 and 2 than in years 1 and 7. The second bias
is heteroskedasticity that occurs when the residuals do not have a common variance. The
third is contemporaneous correlation. The Parks method corrects for all of these biases.
This particular type of time-series cross sectional analysis has been performed in other
management studies (Mizruchi & Stearns, 1988; Stearns & Mizruchi, 1993).

The analysis is performed using models with no lag between the independent and depen-
dent variables and with a 1-year lag to account for any lagged effects of speciﬁc competen-
cies and imitation activity on ﬁrm performance. Conceptually, the independent variables
represent a ﬁrm’s stock of competencies and similarly, the variable imitability is capturing
the cumulative imitation of technological competence. On the other hand, there may also
be lagged effects so that accumulated competencies affect performance in future periods.
Other studies in this area have shown lagged effects (Deng et al., 1999; Hausman et al.,
1984).

Results

Concerning the patent citation analysis, Table 2 shows the breakdown of the citations
into within sample and outside of the sample. The sample includes a total of 4198 patents.
One thousand six hundred and eight of those patents are self-cites within the group. Two
thousand two hundred and ﬁfty-three are cites from outside the sample. The average patent
activity for the sample is 97 patents.

Descriptive statistics and the correlation analysis are presented in Table 3. Techncomp
and Imitability were standardized. A t-test was performed to check for differences of the
means between technological competence and imitability. The test was signiﬁcant at the
.001 level. It should be noted that citations begin to decline during the last year because
in some cases, citations are made to these patents after 1991. This should be kept in mind
when interpreting the regression results (Hall, 1998).

The results of the correlation analysis show no problems of multicollinearity among
the independent variables. As would be expected there is a signiﬁcant positive correlation
between Assets and Patents suggesting that larger ﬁrms engage in more patenting activity.
The positive and signiﬁcant correlation between Age and Assets further implies that older
ﬁrms are larger in size. Patents are negatively correlated with RD/Sales, suggesting that
more research and development dollars do not necessarily result in increased patenting

activity. Ad/Sales has a negative relationship with age, assets and RD/Sales. This implies that
older and larger ﬁrms spend less on advertising and sales. The inverse relationship among
AD/Sales and RD/Sales suggests that ﬁrms that spend more on research and development
spend less on advertising.

Table 4 shows the regression results for four models. Using ROA as the dependent vari-
able, there are consistent results across both models for Techcomp and Imitability. Support-
ing Hypothesis 1, Techcomp is positive and signiﬁcant. Imitability is negative and signiﬁ-
cant supporting Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 is not supported as Ad/Sales is not signiﬁcant.
Hypothesis 4 is supported in the lagged model as Approval is positive and signiﬁcant. Of
the control variables, Assets and RD/Sales are positive and signiﬁcant in Models 1 and 2.
Age is negative and signiﬁcant in the lagged model.

Models 3 and 4 show the regression results with MKBK as the dependent variable. Con-
trary to Models 1 and 2, there are different results, particularly with Techcomp. In Model 3,
there is no relationship between Techcomp and MKBK. However, in Model 4, there is a neg-
ative and signiﬁcant relationship between Techcomp and MKBK suggesting that building on
ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge adversely affects future cash ﬂows. In support of Hypothesis 2 and
consistent with the results found in Models 1 and 2, Imitability is negative and signiﬁcant
with MKBK. AD/Sales is positive and signiﬁcant in both models supporting Hypothesis 3.
Hypothesis 4 is also supported as Approval is positive and signiﬁcant. With respect to the
control variables, Assets is positive and signiﬁcant in both Models 3 and 4. RD/Sales is
directly and signiﬁcantly related to MKBK only in Model 3. Finally, Patents is positive and
signiﬁcant in both Models 3 and 4 skills in terms of preventing knowledge appropriation.

Discussion

Despite the theoretical support for a relationship among technological competence and
performance, the empirical results in this study are conﬂicting. Technological competence
has a positive impact on return on assets and a negative effect on market to book value in
the lagged model. Return on assets is a return on investment measure. These results suggest


44

D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50

that in the short term, building on prior stocks of knowledge may be a superior strategy.
However, future cash ﬂows, as evidenced by market to book value, do not beneﬁt from a
strategy of building on ﬁrm knowledge stocks.

What accounts for this unpredicted ﬁnding? Building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge could
indicate the development of core rigidities (Leonard-Barton, 1995) and the market sees this
as a shortcoming. The implication is that relying on the same competencies (as well as the
self-citations demanded by such reliance) rather than developing new competencies is dam-
aging to ﬁrm performance. This could lead to ignoring external developments that may be
crucial to future competitive advantage, particularly in environments characterized by rapid
scientiﬁc and technological advances. These results not only highlight the controversy over
appropriate performance measures in the strategy literature but also speak to the challenges
facing managers when making strategic decisions. Building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge
may be proﬁtable in the short term but the market views does not view this strategy as the
route to competitive advantage. Reliance on the same competencies will not carry the day
in the future, as is evidenced by the inverse relationship between technological competence
and market to book value. This may also be seen as “active inertia”—that is, the tendency
of ﬁrm’s to persist in a current trajectory and continue established behavior patterns (Sull,
1999). Sull (1999) suggests that companies become stuck in modes of thinking and working
that initially brought them success. When the environment changes, ﬁrms may be unable
or incapable of adapting.

The predicted negative relationship between imitability and ﬁrm performance was sup-
ported in all models. This is quite a signiﬁcant result given the magnitude of the imitability
concept in the resource-based view. These ﬁndings provide strong evidence that a ﬁrm’s
competitive advantage can be diluted quickly as other ﬁrms draw from its technological
knowledge.

Marketing competence is positively and signiﬁcantly related to market to book value but
not to return on assets. This implies that the development of marketing competencies is a
necessary expense that does not immediately contribute to accounting returns but may in
fact contribute to the future value of the ﬁrm. Regulatory competence is positive and signiﬁ-
cant in all but one of the regression models afﬁrming the importance of cultivating effective
relationships with governmental bodies. In the pharmaceutical industry, a regulatory com-
petence is a valued asset that is developed over time and contributes to ﬁrm performance.
The total number of patents is positive and signiﬁcant only in the market to book regression
models. This ﬁnding is consistent with recent prior literature (Deng et al., 1999; Hall, 1998)
on the relationship between patenting activity and market value.

The ﬁeld of organizational ecology has addressed the repercussions of aging on organi-
zational innovation, but there is no consensus in that literature as to whether these reper-
cussions are positive or negative in terms of ﬁrm performance (Sorensen & Stuart, 2000).
This analysis seems to suggest that the market is agnostic as to the age of the ﬁrm. Age is
negative and signiﬁcant with ROA, implying that as ﬁrms get older, their return on their
current investment shrinks.

Finally, research and development intensity is directly related to performance in all but
Model 4. As mentioned earlier, prior theoretical and empirical literature is inconsistent
about the impact of research investment on organizational performance. To some extent,
these results exhibit that same inconsistency.


D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50

45

Overall, these ﬁndings seem to suggest that competencies are better predictors of market
measures of performance. This seems to square well with previous studies using patent
data (Deng et al., 1999) and market measures of performance. It also implies that the
market incorporates the affect of stocks of competencies—be it positive or negative—into
its evaluation of future performance.

Future Research

In addition to the questions this study addresses, the results suggest several new
directions for future research. This article used patent citation data to tease out the ex-
tent to which ﬁrms built upon their own innovative activity. Future research might seek
out other ways of measuring the phenomena of building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge.
For example, competencies could develop from a combination of internal and external
learning, or the re-combining of internal knowledge, or from the acquisition of external
knowledge. Incorporating measures that represent these different dimensions of techno-
logical competence may increase our understanding technological competencies and their
impact on ﬁrm performance. However, measuring ﬁrm knowledge building is a difﬁcult
task.

Another avenue of research is to explore the intriguing possibility that ﬁrms whose
innovations have been imitated may in fact learn from the imitator. In other words, a ﬁrm may
be able to enhance its knowledge by learning from what others have done in their attempts
to imitate them. A scholarly examination of how imitation of knowledge may impact the
originator of that knowledge would provide tremendous insights into the strategy, learning
and technology areas.

This study proposed a measure for imitability, a central construct in the resource-based
view that is at the ﬁrm level and not been used before. The ﬁndings for the imitability
measure are a ﬁrst step and should spur future research interest in both operationalizing this
construct and examining its relationship to ﬁrm performance. Related to this, researchers
could investigate how ﬁrms try to prevent imitation. Protecting knowledge from appropri-
ation is a skill unto itself and examining the ways ﬁrms do this would be an interesting
avenue of research.

Another avenue for future research in this area is the generation of alternative measures
for both marketing competence and regulatory competence. As marketing competence is
strategically important not only for pharmaceuticals but for many industries, the creation of
more reﬁned measures of this construct would be a great contribution to this area. Similarly,
regulatory competence, the ability to deal effectively and successfully with government
agencies, is a critical strategic competence in many industries. Through communicating and
working with government agencies, companies gain a certain reputation for their adroitness
or ineptness in this area. Incorporating the impact of reputation more directly into a measure
of regulatory competence might shed more light on the relationship between regulatory
competencies and ﬁrm performance.

Finally, the fundamental issue of does innovation or day-to-day execution of business
processes matter more for ﬁrm performance is highlighted in this study. In the market to
book models, both execution variables, marketing and regulatory competence are directly
related to ﬁrm performance, while in the ROA models, technological competence, not the


46

D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50

other competence variables, directly inﬂuence performance. Future research could explore
this possibility.

Practical Implications

These ﬁndings generate some interesting managerial implications. First, the results sug-
gest that accumulation of ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge does not always lead to a competitive
advantage. In fact, these results actually suggest that reliance on the same competencies
harms ﬁrm performance in the long run. In technologically dynamic industries, the acquisi-
tion and incorporation of new knowledge is critical to both short and long term competitive
advantage as evidenced by these ﬁndings. Companies are challenged to simultaneously
learn how to exploit their current competencies while allocating resources to develop new
ones. With respect to the pharmaceutical industry, the rapid advances in biotechnology
necessitate quick learning of new competencies for established pharmaceutical ﬁrms.

Second, and most challenging for the pharmaceutical industry, is the ﬁnding with respect
to imitability. Being innovative is a double-edged sword in pharmaceuticals as patenting
protects yet reveals knowledge. Despite the fact that knowledge building is critical, the
imitation of ﬁrm knowledge can be detrimental. Competitors may imitate and approve upon
innovations creating new knowledge, techniques and products. These ﬁndings underpin the
managerial imperatives of (1) monitoring and incorporating technological developments;
(2) continually generating innovations and (3) improving their skills in terms of preventing
knowledge appropriation.

Limitations

These ﬁndings, their interpretation and my subsequent discussion must be considered in
the context of the study’s limitations. This investigation focused on one industry and, as such,
lacks generalizability. However, with a homogeneous sample, any industry disturbances are
held constant for all ﬁrms. Deeper insight into the effects of competencies and imitability
on ﬁrm performance would be obtained by examining these variables in different industries.
The data covered only a selected time period. Longer time frames may shed more light on
the robustness of the hypothesized relationships. In some cases, citations made to speciﬁc
patents may decline in later years, as there is not enough time for them to be cited. This
limitation should be recognized in interpreting the regression results. Moreover, the patent
data used in this study has some limitations. First, I was unable to differentiate between
product and process patents and also patent categories and there may exist systematic
differences in patent citations among these different types of patents. The second limitation
of this particular patent data set is the inability to identify licensed or acquired patents that
have implications in terms of ﬁrm’s building on a stock of knowledge.

Conclusion

This article opened with a quote from Prahalad and Hamel (1990) in which they sug-
gested that developing new competencies is no easy task—rather unlike simply getting off
one train and sauntering onto another. Implicit in their analogy is the fact that accumulation

47

of expertise not only takes time to acquire, but it also takes time to transform. These empir-
ical results highlight the jeopardy inherent in acquiring competencies and the importance
of new learning. These empirical ﬁndings also provide evidence of the negative relation-
ship between competitor imitation of knowledge and ﬁrm performance. Finally, the results
suggest that ﬁrm performance is affected by other competencies, such as marketing and
regulatory.

It is hoped that the results presented here stimulate new resource-based research on
the relationship between competencies, imitability and ﬁrm performance in other industry
contexts.
