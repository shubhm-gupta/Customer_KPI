CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Statement of the Problem 

The use of employee involvement (El) programs as a method to improve 

organizational performance has grown rapidly since they were first studied during the 

1950s at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, and is likely to grow in 

the future (Cummings & Worley,  1993; Lawler, Ledford, & Mohrman,  1989; Lawler, 

Mohrman, & Ledford,  1995; Napier & Gershenfeld,  1993).  Employee involvement refers 

to various techniques that spread or share four critical organizational processes which 

influence participation (power, information, knowledge, and rewards) to lower levels in 

the organization (Lawler,  1986; Steinecke,  1993).  Examples of typical employee 

involvement activities which are provided by organizations for their employees to 

participate in include quality circles, gain sharing plans, and self-managing work teams. 

The employee involvement approach to organizational management emphasizes benefits 

from employee participation such as increased quality, increased job satisfaction and 

internal work motivation, reduced absenteeism and turnover, and higher quality problem­

solving and decision-making.  Further, Corrigan recently (1998) found that employee 

involvement activities were associated with higher job performance.  It has also been

well-documented in both experimental and field studies (Doherty, Nord, & McAdams, 

1989; Gowen & Jennings,  1990; Larson,  1989) that employee involvement activities lead 

to improved productivity.  Further, employee involvement programs are expected to lead 

indirectly to better working conditions and self-development of employees, as well as 

greater opportunities for self-expression.  Lawler (1975) collectively referred to many of 

these work-related outcomes as psychological quality of work life.  According to Lawler 

et al. (1995):

The involvement approach is based on the idea that organizations should be 

designed from top to bottom so that employees are in control of their destiny and 

able to participate in the business of the organization.  In order to participate in the 

business, employees at all levels need power, information, knowledge, and 

rewards that are relevant to business performance,  (pp.  1 -2)

This approach to employee involvement implies that employees should perceive 

they are in control of their own destiny while in their organizational environments.  It 

implies a causal relationship between El techniques and the perception of one's work 

environment with an internal locus o f control orientation.  Because El programs are 

expected to lead to indicators of high quality of work life, the Lawler et al. (1995) 

approach implies that an internal locus of control orientation will lead to specific

perceptions o f quality o f work life.1  However, employee involvement programs are not 

designed with the specific goal of being locus o f control change techniques for those who 

have an external orientation.

Locus of Control

Locus o f control is an individual’s belief that what happens to him or her is 

controlled either internally by his or her own efforts, or externally, by the efforts of others 

or by fate (Rotter,  1966).  An individual’s belief about control of his or her work-related 

outcomes, such as career advancements and pay increases is referred to as his or her work 

locus of control (Spector,  1982).  There has been some debate in the literature about 

whether locus of control  is a stable trait or a relatively unstable state.  Rotter (1966), who 

developed the theory supporting the idea of a locus of control continuum, believes that 

once it is learned through prior experiences, locus of control is a relatively stable 

personality trait.  However, Gardner and Beatty (1980) suggest various ways for human 

resource personnel, teachers, and employment counselors to implement effective locus of 

control change techniques, which implies that it is relatively malleable and therefore 

unstable.  These techniques include explaining the concept of locus o f control so 

individuals can understand it, setting performance goals which reflect taking control in

'The term “perception of quality of work life” is used interchangeably with 

“quality of work life” throughout this study.

various situations, and the immediate rewarding of behavior which reflects the individual 

taking responsibility.  According to Lokan, Boss, and Patsula (1982):

. . .  most counselors seem to adhere to [the belief] that much of their activity may 

be viewed as aiding individuals in their movement from feelings of relative 

helplessness to feelings of greater self power (sense of agency) in resolving 

school-related, work-related, or other personal concerns, (pp. 340-341)

Because of the current status of the locus of control construct being subject to a 

‘'trait vs. state” debate, and because models such as the Lawler et al. (1995) approach 

advocate that organizations be designed in a way which gives employees control of their 

destiny, and further, because El programs are not intended to be locus of control change 

techniques, the purpose o f this research is to examine the role of locus of control  in the 

relationship between El activities, and perceptions of individuals' quality of work life.

Employee Involvement 

Employee involvement is a term used to describe an approach to improving 

organizational effectiveness.  This approach emphasizes the designing of organization 

and management systems to be more participative by involving employees at all levels in 

problem-solving, decision-making, and the financial success of the organization (Lawler 

et al.,  1995).  The way in which El programs work, is to increase employees’ opportunity 

for participation in the business of the organization.  At the level of the collective

consciousness of an organization’s employees, El programs work to alter how individuals 

experience their work (Lawler,  1986).  Organizations with a climate of employee 

involvement will have the four key El elements (power, information, knowledge, 

rewards) spread throughout their organizations when assessed at the individual employee 

level of analysis.  This is typically measured by gathering information on individuals’ 

assessments o f the extent to which they believe they have the opportunity to be involved 

in the four key areas.  According to Vandenberg (1996), an organizational climate 

characterized as having high levels of employee involvement is “a collective experience, 

and represents an actual condition in the organization that binds individual well-being to 

organizational success” (p. 8).  The difference between El and what is commonly referred 

to as participative management, is that El is more than just a programmatic approach and 

more o f an organizational process perspective (Coye & Belohlav,  1995).  El is a function 

o f the four organizational processes on which it focuses.  Lawler (1992) addresses the 

difference between El and participative management by stating:

Creating a high-involvement organization involves making choices about 

organizational design that create a world in which individuals know more, do 

more, and contribute more.  Such an organization is not the result o f a change in 

job design or pay systems; it is the result of a change in the entire design of the 

organization, (p. 5)

According to Lawler (1986), there are four critical organizational processes that

constitute employee involvement.  These processes are:  information sharing, training, 

decision-making, and rewards.  As stated by Vandenberg (1996), "the reality is that they 

[the four elements of El] work together to create a climate of El, and it is their collective 

presence that has the strongest associations with organizational effectiveness" (p.  15). 

Information sharing refers to the degree to which information about the business is made 

available to employees, in both a downward and upward information flow.  Without a 

high degree of information sharing, it is hard for individuals to make contributions to the 

direction of the organization.  Lawler et al.’s (1995) employee involvement practices 

survey indicates that, "Most employees do not get good information on the direction and 

success of the business. Given this fact, it is hard to imagine most employees being 

meaningfully involved in decisions affecting anything more than their immediate job 

duties" (p.  12).

Training refers to the degree to which organizations provide opportunities for 

employees to acquire specific skill sets related to organizational operations and higher 

performance.  In addition, many El processes involve interpersonal interactions such as 

meetings, group problem-solving, and the need to influence others, and thus require 

training in the use of these particular skills and abilities.  The results of the Lawler et al. 

(1995) survey indicate that most employees are not trained in the interpersonal skills 

necessary for El to be effective.  "Although training is growing, it still appears to fall 

short of the level needed if employee involvement and total quality management are to

work -- indeed, for most businesses to perform effectively, regardless of what 

management approach they use" (Lawler et al.,  1995, p. 17).

Another critical organizational process that constitutes El is decision-making.

This element of El is commonly referred to as "power."  As an element o f El, power 

refers to the degree to which decision-making authority is moved down to lower levels in 

the organization.  This also involves expanding the type of decisions which can be made 

at lower organizational levels.  The practice of sharing power involves problem-solving 

activities that are parallel structures to the normal day-to-day operations.  The results of 

the  1995  Lawler et al. survey indicate that most companies are only beginning to use 

power sharing practices or are using them only selectively.  They are not using them 

throughout the organization.  This finding "suggests that many companies are still not 

committed to creating high-involvement work organizations" (Lawler et al.,  1995, 

p. 31).

Rewarding employee performance  is the fourth organizational process which 

constitutes El, according to Lawler (1986).  This process refers to the types o f rewards 

and compensation used within the organization.  The degree to which an organization 

structures its systems to reward individuals for their organizational performance is the El 

element to which Lawler is referring.  Traditional plans such as individual  incentive 

programs do not adequately support a culture of high employee involvement.  The use of 

productivity gainsharing plans is closely associated with employee involvement practices.

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


8

These plans emphasize employee involvement for financial incentive.  However, the 

results o f the survey completed in  1993 (Lawler et al.,  1995) indicate that although 

gainsharing is the least used approach, organizations do have the ability to increase 

involvement by rewarding desired organizational performance.  Lawler et al. (1995) state, 

that "most organizations do not make a significant effort to reward most individuals for 

their performance" (p.22).

Although the use of employee involvement programs is predicted to grow (Lawler 

et al.,  1995), these efforts will not reach their full potential until certain challenges are 

met (Miller & Prichard,  1992).  One of these challenges is that employee involvement 

programs are routinely voluntary and therefore, not all employees are interested or 

motivated to participate in the various El activities.  Further, Miller and Prichard state, "a 

critical challenge is to attract and maintain the active involvement of substantial 

percentages of employees" (p. 415).  To be a successful part of the organization, 

employee involvement programs must have a high level of participation.  For an El 

program to be successful, it must become part of an organization's culture; it must 

become a component of the organization's implied belief system, its norms and values. 

Employee involvement activities must be integrated into the structure of the organization 

at all levels (Larson,  1989).  When all four elements (information sharing, training, 

decision-making, rewards) of an organization's employee involvement activities are 

occurring at the lowest employee levels in the organization, El will have become a

characteristic of the organization's culture.  Limited approaches focusing on 

implementing fewer than the four key parts will produce only limited results (Lawler, 

1982;  1986).  However, according to Miller and Monge (1986),  for members of an 

organization, the opportunity to participate in employee involvement activities provided 

by the organization is as important as actually partaking in them.  In other words, an El 

culture is a condition that exists in the organization but can be perceived differently by 

organizational members.  Employee involvement programs are designed to change how 

employees experience their organization in an attempt to increase organizational 

effectiveness (Lawler et al.,  1995).  However, they are not designed to be locus of control 

change techniques and therefore if employees have external work locus of control 

orientations, some organizations may be unsuccessful at using the El approach to try to 

change how individuals experience their work environment.

This study will aid in understanding the role that locus o f control has in the 

relationship between El activities and perceptions of quality o f work life.  Most of the 

previous research that has examined the relationship between employee involvement 

activities and work-related outcomes, such as indicators of quality of work life, has not 

addressed the role of a personality component such as locus o f control, as potential 

moderators or mediators to this relationship.

Objectives and Goals

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between organizational 

employee involvement activities and quality of work life, and examine how locus of 

control affects this relationship.  The study empirically determined if work locus of 

control moderates or mediates the relationship.

By stating that organizations should be designed from top to bottom to give their 

employees control of their work-related outcomes, models such as Lawler’s (1986) 

approach imply that individuals in organizations may perceive that they are in control of 

their organizational outcomes.  However, if a person has an external locus of control 

orientation, he or she may not perceive control of his or her work-related outcomes. 

Models such as Lawler’s (1986) imply that it is beneficial  for El programs if employees 

have an internal locus o f control orientation and therefore the model may not sufficiently 

account for the relationship between El activities and their intended outcomes.  The 

current research empirically examined the role of individual differences in locus of 

control, a component of one’s personality, to better understand the manner in which El 

activities affect their desired outcomes.  The clarification of the role of locus of control in 

this relationship will help both researchers and organizations gain a better understanding 

of what to expect from, and how to maximize the outcomes of their employee 

involvement activities.

Definitions of Terms

Employee Involvement-  An approach to managing organizational performance 

with the goal of increased employee participation in decision-making;  organizational 

programs where employees are encouraged to participate in the management process by 

problem-solving to increase productivity;  includes a variety of techniques which promote 

involvement in decision-making, information sharing, training, and rewards (Lawler, 

1986; Steinecke,  1993).

Locus of Control-  The degree to which individuals believe their behavioral 

outcomes are determined by their own actions (internal orientation), or by the actions of 

others and external forces (external orientation) (Rotter,  1966).

Work Locus of Control-  The degree to which individuals believe their work- 

related outcomes, including but not limited to career advancements, performance 

appraisals, work assignments, and pay increases are determined by their own actions 

(internal work locus of control), or determined by others in the organization (external 

work locus of control) (Spector,  1982).

Quality of Work Life-  The evaluation of one's current overall work life 

experiences;  may include but not be limited to aspects of job satisfaction, internal work 

motivation, physical and psychological working conditions, compensation, turnover 

desire, and job quality (Lawler,  1975).

Total Quality Management-  A set o f organizational practices, strategies, and tools

which emphasize the use of participation groups; uses problem-solving and decision­

making techniques similar to employee involvement activities to focus on meeting the 

needs o f the customer, primarily through process measurement and feedback (Lawler et 

al.,  1995).

Hypotheses

Because employee involvement activities are expected to lead indirectly to better 

working conditions and self-development o f employees, as well as opportunities for 

greater self-expression, it is hypothesized that:

Hypothesis 1 ( H I ) :  There will be a significant relationship between an employee’s 

opportunity to participate in employee involvement activities and his or her quality of 

work life, such that the more an employee has the opportunity to participate in El 

activities, the greater the employee will perceive his or her quality o f work life.

Research indicates that employees who have an internal locus of control tend to 

be more satisfied with their jobs than those with an external locus of control (Spector, 

1982).  Further, because job satisfaction is a component part of quality of work life and 

should therefore manifest itself as self-reports of perceived higher quality of work life, it 

is hypothesized that:

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


13

Hypothesis 2 (H2):  There will be a significant relationship between an employee’s

work locus of control orientation and his or her quality of work life, such that those with 

a more internal orientation will perceive a higher quality o f work life.

When given the opportunity to have greater control of work related outcomes 

through participating in employee involvement activities, individuals with an external 

locus of control do not believe they can influence these outcomes.  However individuals 

with a more internal locus of control orientation will receive reinforcement of their 

internal orientation by participating in employee involvement activities, and will 

therefore report higher levels of QWL when compared to individuals with an external 

orientation.  According to Lawler et al. (1995), El is frequently cited as a method of 

improving organizational effectiveness.2  It is therefore believed that employee 

involvement activities will be more effective for those with an internal locus of control. 

It is therefore hypothesized that:

Hypothesis 3a (H3a):  There will be a significant interaction between the opportunity to 

participate in employee involvement activities and locus of control orientation, such that

2Quality o f work life can both directly and indirectly lead to indicators of 

organizational effectiveness such as productivity improvements (Lawler & Ledford, 
1981).

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


14

there will be a stronger relationship between the opportunity for participation in employee 

involvement activities and perception of quality of work life for employees with a more 

internal locus of control orientation (See Figure  1).

According to Lawler et al. (1995), employees in organizations should have the 

opportunity to control their work lives by participating in the business of the 

organizations.  Because this theory implies that employee involvement activities lead to 

perceived control of work life (through the greater involvement in the four El related 

processes enhancing feelings o f control over work-related outcomes) which in turn, is 

related to perceived quality of work life, it is hypothesized that:

Hypothesis 3b (H3b):  Work locus o f control will mediate the relationship between the 

opportunity to participate in employee involvement activities and an employee’s 

perception of quality of work life (See Figure 2).

CHAPTER II 

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE

Employee Involvement 

In a comprehensive investigation of current organizational practices in employee 

involvement and total quality management, Lawler et al. (1989) and Lawler et al. (1995), 

analyzed survey data from Fortune  1000 corporations.  They found that over 80% of the 

organizations surveyed practiced some employee involvement techniques.  The results of 

the survey showed that a majority of the organizations used employee involvement 

activities to improve productivity and work quality.  Organizations not only use these 

activities to increase productivity and quality, but to a lesser extent, to increase employee 

motivation and morale.  A majority of organizations also reported improvements in 

desirable internal operating conditions such as the following indicators of employee 

quality of work life: job satisfaction, work motivation, job involvement, and turnover. 

Organizations were very satisfied with the results of their El activities and as a result, 

planned to expand them.  The results of the survey showed that the greatest 

organizational improvements associated with the use of employee involvement practices 

were in participatory management, trust, management decision-making, and 

organizational processes and procedures, consistent with the Lawler et al.,  1989 survey of

employee involvement practices; "The overwhelming majority of companies believe that 

their overall El efforts are successful" (Lawler et al.,  1995, p. 68).  The survey found that 

the future growth of El and Total Quality Management (TQM) programs is likely.

The extent to which organizations implement and employees participate in El 

programs, may further be related to other factors.  Miller and Prichard (1992) confirmed 

that employees who are interested in participation in El programs are generally younger, 

more interested in job advancement, and more optimistic about El benefits.  In an 

exploratory analysis of the results of the Fortune  1000 employee involvement survey 

conducted by  Lawler et al. (1989), Coye and Belohlav (1995) found that the degree of El 

in an organization was related to the use of participative management programs and the 

level of participation within the programs.  They concluded that the significance of the 

employee involvement and participative management relationship may be mediated by 

other factors such as level of trust or the number of programs concurrently existing.  They 

suggest that future research address these issues.  They believe that the resolution of these 

questions and others, would provide a "more uniform perspective on the meaning and 

practice of employee participation within organizations" (p.  15).  The current study 

examined the extent to which the outcomes of El programs may have been mediated by 

other factors.

Employee Involvement Models 

Cummings and Worley (1993), state, "An assumption underlying much of the 

employee involvement literature is that employee involvement interventions will lead to 

higher productivity" (p. 309).  This is based on the assumption that if organizations can 

change their management systems to be more participative and include employees in 

problem-solving, decision-making, and financial success, then organizations can improve 

their performance (Lawler et al.,  1995).  The link between El and productivity comes 

from the idea that when people are more involved in work-related decisions, they become 

more satisfied and this should, in turn, improve productivity.  However, Cummings and 

Worley further state, "there is growing evidence that this satisfaction-causes-productivity 

premise is too simplistic and sometimes wrong" (p. 310).  They believe that a more 

realistic explanation of the relationship is that of Lawler and Ledford (1981) shown in 

Figure 3.

According to this model, El practices can improve productivity in various ways.  One 

way in which El practices can improve productivity is by integrating different jobs or 

departments contributing to a common task.  This improvement would be a result of 

better employee communication and coordination.  Further, when individual needs are 

satisfied, improved productivity can result due to increased employee motivation. 

According to need theories of motivation, the drive to satisfy some psychological need 

can lead to motivation (Alderfer,  1969).  When applied in a work setting, Maslow’s Need 

Hierarchy Theory (1970) examines the drive of employees to satisfy different levels of 

needs.  An individual will seek to fulfill his or her lowest level of needs before higher 

level needs.  At the lowest need level, an individual may be working for income to 

provide basic necessities for his or her family, such as food and shelter.  As an individual 

fulfills needs at the lower levels, he or she may be motivated by higher level needs such 

as recognition for his or her accomplishments or to attain a sense of personal or 

professional fulfillment.  When employees have the abilities to perform well, and the 

situation allows people to affect productivity, the intrinsic motivation associated with the 

drive to meet higher level needs can lead to improved productivity.  Additionally, El 

practices can lead to improved productivity when employees are given the opportunity to 

improve their capabilities.  Typically, this is done with employee training as a method of 

El.  Secondary effects on productivity are shown in the model developed by Lawler and 

Ledford (1981), depicted in Figure 4.

According to this model, El practices can also have secondary effects on 

productivity by means o f increased employee well being and satisfaction which result 

from both the El practices themselves and from the feedback and potential rewards which 

would accompany productivity increases.  Employee well-being and satisfaction can lead 

to attracting and retaining high-performing personnel, thus affecting productivity.

Empowerment

Psychological empowerment is another approach similar to the previous models 

that attempts to explain the relationship between employee involvement activities and 

outcomes such as quality o f work life.  Empowerment is a process by which employees' 

sense of power and personal control is increased (Riggio,  1990).  Psychological 

empowerment refers to empowerment at the individual level o f analysis (Zimmerman,

1995).  Employees can become empowered by the development o f their sense of self- 

efficacy, the belief that they can accomplish a particular task (Conger & Kanungo,  1988). 

However, organizational research has focused on management practices which empower 

employees, such as the sharing of decision-making with lower level employees in the 

organization, and increasing access to information at the lower levels  (Spreitzer,  1995). 

Conger and Kanungo (1988) believe that past research has treated empowerment from a 

management practice perspective so often, that "employee participation is simply equated 

with empowerment" (p. 473), rather than a motivational construct such as self-efficacy. 

Empowerment is an individual’s sense of intrinsic motivation from valued experiences in 

the workplace (Thomas & Velthouse,  1990).  Empowerment is manifested as four 

cognitions: meaning, competence, impact, and choice.  These four cognitions represent an 

employee’s assessment of his or her total work environment (Spreitzer,  1995).  Recently, 

Corrigan (1998) found that the four components of employee involvement were each, 

individually related to empowerment.  However, empowerment is distinct from El 

because El is an approach to managing organizational behavior and empowerment is a 

cognitive result of the El approach.  Similar to the Lawler (1986) model, the 

empowerment approach assumes that by providing a certain work environment or job 

characteristic such as increased participation in decision-making, certain outcomes such 

as improved organizational effectiveness will be likely.  In addition, similar to the other 

models, the empowerment approach does not examine the role of individual differences

in personality traits on the relationship between empowerment activities and outcomes; it 

only assumes changes in one's level of self-efficacy as a result of the empowerment 

activity.

22

Quality of Work Life 

For the purpose of this study, quality o f work life (QWL) is defined in terms of 

employees' reactions to work outcomes, although one approach to defining QWL 

discusses the specific techniques, approaches, and methods used for improving work, 

often referred to as the quality of work life initiative (Cummings & Worley,  1993).  QWL 

consists o f various interrelated component factors (Lawler,  1982).  Definitions of QWL 

have included comprehensive aspects of work outcomes briefly summarized by Riggio 

(1990) as "the evaluative state of all aspects of work" (p. 214).  A conceptual, 

comprehensive model of QWL was proposed by Walton (1975).  This model includes 

many aspects of work life such as compensation, physical and psychological working 

conditions, opportunities for skill development, protection of employee rights, social 

opportunities, balance of work and non-work life, opportunity for career growth, and job 

security.  However, because of the subjective and comprehensive nature of the quality of 

work life definition proposed by Walton (1975), valid measurement of the construct 

would be difficult.  According to Luthans (1989), it is still not clear exactly what a belter 

QWL means.  However, Lawler (1982) suggests that a more realistic indicator of QWL

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


would involve regularly measuring variables that are closely related and therefore may be 

indicators of QWL such as employee absenteeism, turnover, accident rates, job 

satisfaction, and amount o f money spent on employee training and development.

23

Job Satisfaction Component of OWL

Although a variety o f interrelated factors such as job commitment, motivation, 

job involvement, and attitude toward pay comprise an individual's quality of work life 

index, job satisfaction has a large role.  Further, it is believed that the possible outcomes 

of job satisfaction such as internal and external turnover intentions are affected by El 

activities (Cammann, Fichman, Jenkins, & Klesh,  1983).  Cammann et al. state:

The underlying theoretical viewpoint is an expectancy theory, arguing that one 

consequence of participative QWL [employee involvement] activities may be 

more strongly perceived linkages between job activities and valued outcomes. 

Consequently, effort, satisfaction, and turnover should be affected by changes in 

perceived performance-outcome contingencies, (p. 81)

According tp Mitchell and Larson (1987), job satisfaction is generally recognized 

in the science of organizational behavior as one of the most frequently studied attitudes. 

Locke (1976) summarizes job satisfaction as a positive emotional state which results 

from an individual’s job-related experiences.  Job satisfaction is both the feelings and 

attitudes one has about his or her job or specific aspects of the job.  Overall, these

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


24

feelings and attitudes can be positive or negative.  As summarized by Luthans (1989), job 

satisfaction is comprised of three distinct dimensions.  The first dimension is an 

individual’s emotional response to a particular job setting.  This response can only be 

inferred, it cannot be seen.  It involves the manner in which the individual reacts to the 

total organizational environment.  The second dimension is determined by whether or not 

a person's expectations are met or exceeded by work-related outcomes.  These outcomes 

will help determine if an individual's attitudes toward work are positive or negative.  If an 

individual perceives him or herself to be working harder and contributing more than 

others in the organization, but receiving less pay, this individual may develop a negative 

attitude toward coworkers or management or toward the work itself.  The third dimension 

is that job satisfaction involves several related attitudes (Luthans,  1989).  These attitudes 

include facets of job satisfaction such as satisfaction with pay, working conditions, 

supervision, and the work itself (Locke,  1976).

Motowidlo’s (1996) model o f job satisfaction further identifies and explains how 

dimensions of individual differences may affect job satisfaction.  This information- 

processing model of job satisfaction, examines the cognitive processes involved in self- 

reports of job satisfaction.  The model assumes that self-reports o f job satisfaction reflect 

an individual’s judgements about the favorability of the work environment.  According to 

the model, an individual’s judgements are reactions to events and conditions such as the 

immediate task environment, social environment, and other broader aspects o f the

2 5

organizational environment.  According to Motowidlo (1996):

This information-processing model suggests four different ways of defining job 

satisfaction: normative favorability (the favorability of the population of events 

and conditions in the work environment), experienced favorability (the 

favorability of events and conditions in the input sample), remembered 

favorability (the favorability o f events and conditions in the retrieved sample), 

and volitional favorability (the favorability that people try to present in their self- 

reports of job satisfaction. These four constructs are causally related to each 

other, (p.  183)

This model highlights that individual differences in the cognitive processes associated 

with job satisfaction, may affect how individuals within an organization report outcomes 

o f employee involvement activities.

In addition to individual differences in job satisfaction and its antecedents, group 

differences have also been found.  As a group, American workers in a variety of 

occupations from many different organizations are generally satisfied with their jobs.  As 

a group, white-collar occupations and professionals in the work force, when compared to 

those in blue collar occupations, report higher job satisfaction, as do older workers when 

compared to their younger counterparts.  Black employees have consistently reported 

lower levels of job satisfaction when compared with White employees (Weaver,  1980). 

Quality of work life is an area of organizational concern which has a macro

26

perspective.  It is not based on a particular theory and does not prescribe a particular 

technique for application.  “Instead, QWL is more concerned with the overall climate of 

work” (Luthans,  1989, p.  273).  QWL is unlike the sociotechnical approach to job design 

which is based on systems theory where the focus is the interface between the 

technological and the social system.  To improve quality of work life in employees, an 

organization must change the entire work climate.  Quality of work life is a variable 

which represents individuals’ evaluations of their work or aspects o f their work (Nadler 

& Lawler,  1983).

OWL Determinants

There is some debate in the literature as to what the principal determinants of 

one's QWL perception are (Kerce & Booth-Kewley,  1993).  The primary debate is 

between the dispositional approach and the structural approach.  The dispositional 

approach assumes that an individual’s dispositional tendencies are his or her primary 

QWL determinant.  Dispositional tendencies are personal attributes such as an 

individual’s overall positive or negative affective state.  According to this approach, 

individuals are consistent in their job attitudes over time, and their dispositional attributes 

are as strong a determinant of their job attitudes as are the characteristics of their job.

This approach assumes that individuals may be predisposed to certain work attitudes 

(Staw, Bell, & Clausen,  1986).  Referring to the dispositional approach, Staw and Ross

27

(1985) state "although distinctions are sometimes made between the concepts of personal 

dispositions,  traits, personality,  and individual characteristics,  these terms are used 

almost interchangeably in the literature" (p. 470).

In contrast to the dispositional approach, the structural approach assumes that 

situational attributes such as characteristics associated with an individual's job are the 

primary determinant of his or her QWL (Loscocco & Roschelle,  1991).  In summary, 

Kerce and Booth-Kewley (1993) state, "dispositional variables should be considered 

when studying job satisfaction even though structural variables probably have a greater 

impact and are more relevant for managers seeking to improve the quality of work life of 

their workers" (p.  192).  The current study examines the effects of both, a dispositional 

variable (locus of control), and a structural variable (employee involvement).

Another approach assumes that individuals have needs which they seek to fulfill 

at work (Alderfer,  1972).  According to this approach, based on expectancy theory, an 

individual's QWL is not determined by any one particular need structure, but rather, 

individual differences in multiple needs (Alderfer,  1972; Hackman & Lawler,  1971).

As more U.S. organizations expand their operations outside of the United States, 

and as the work force becomes more culturally diverse, factors which influence workers 

to evaluate their work in a positive manner also may change.  QWL definitions are to an 

extent, dependent on cultural context (Kerce & Booth-Kewley,  1993).  Employees' 

perceptions of their jobs may vary based on their individual values, which can vary by

28

age, gender, education, and culture.  Kerce and Booth-Kewley state, "In some societies, 

improving the quality of work life may involve offering greater security while, in others, 

it may involve greater challenge and autonomy or more democratic management styles" 

(p.  191).

As reported by Marks, Hackett, Mirvis, and Grady (1986), the outcomes of 

quality circles (an employee involvement activity) are similar to the outcomes predicted 

by the Job Characteristics Model of Work Motivation (Hackman & Oldham,  1976).  This 

widely recognized model o f job characteristics postulates that certain core job dimensions 

contribute to critical psychological states which will lead to personal and work-related 

outcomes.  These outcomes, such as high internal work motivation and high satisfaction 

with the work, are a large component of one's quality of work life.

If employee involvement activities such as quality circles are examined with the 

Hackman and Oldham (1976) model as the framework, participation in these activities 

may contribute to the critical psychological states o f the model.  More specifically, these 

states are the experienced meaningfulness of the work, the experience o f responsibility 

for work outcomes, and the knowledge of results from work activities.  According to this 

model, a work environment which provides these elements, will lead to the outcomes of 

high internal work motivation, high quality of work performance, high job satisfaction, 

and low turnover and absenteeism, similar to Lawler's (1975) definition of high quality of 

work life.  According to the framework of the job characteristics model, positive work

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


29

outcomes such as motivation, performance and satisfaction are a result of an internal 

process.  Because the model predicts that this internal process leads to these outcomes, 

and because the experience of responsibility for work outcomes is similar to the construct 

of work locus of control, individual differences in work locus of control orientation may 

manifest themselves as differences in personal and work outcomes.  For El related 

activities, these outcomes may be perceptions of quality o f work life.  According to the 

Hackman-Oldham (1976) model, an individual’s growth need strength  (a dispositional 

attribute) moderates the relationship between core job characteristics and outcomes. 

Similarly, individual differences in work locus of control, may moderate the relationship 

between El activities and quality of work life.

Quality of work life, as a multidimensional outcome, may be further understood 

by examining examples of low quality of work life.  Boredom and burnout on the job are 

two frequently discussed indicators of low QWL (Jewell,  1985).  When boredom and its 

associated responses such as daydreaming and decreased job performance are present, 

this may indicate a low quality of work life.  When one's work involves high levels of 

repetition, boredom is likely to result.  Further, burnout, as a response to chronic stress in 

the work environment can also be an indicator of a low quality of work life.  Employee 

involvement programs such as those which facilitate input into decision-making and 

promote job enrichment, may prevent both boredom and bumout.  These programs may 

result in an increase in quality o f work life.

Locus of Control

Locus of control is an individual's belief that what happens to him or her is 

controlled either internally by his or her own efforts, or externally by the efforts of others, 

or by chance or fate (Rotter,  1966).  When an individual believes that what happens to 

him or her is controlled by others, this individual is said to have an external locus of 

control.  If an individual believes in self-control of outcomes, he or she is said to have an 

internal locus of control.  Rotter (1966) believes that most people have a locus of control 

which is somewhere between the two extremes.  As a component o f one’s personality, 

locus of control is fairly well-established by about the seventh grade for people in the 

United States (Hanes &  Prawat,  1979).  Other research done with people from the U.S. 

has found that there is an increasing sense of personal control from age fifteen to around 

thirty or thirty-nine, a stable sense o f internal control from age thirty to fifty-nine, and no 

decline in sense of control for individuals over sixty years of age (Ryckman & Malikiosi, 

1975).

Another individual difference variable which research has compared to locus of 

control is self-efficacy (Bandura,  1986; Gist,  1987).  However, there are two important 

distinctions which can be made between internal locus of control and the construct of 

self-efficacy (Gist,  1987).  First, locus of control is a generalized construct covering a 

variety of situations whereas self-efficacy is a task-specific behavioral belief concerning 

personal capability.  Second, general measures of locus of control include both outcome

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


31

expectancies and behavioral expectancies.  Self-efficacy focuses specifically on behavior 

expectancies (Gist,  1987).  Rotter (1990) discusses that the value of locus of control as a 

construct is largely dependent on the precision with which it is defined, and further, 

emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between locus o f control and other 

constructs with which it may be confused.  According to Rotter, the definition of a 

cognitive variable must be precise enough to lead to a common understanding.  In 

addition. Rotter states, “One might wonder why so many social scientists in the last 30 

years have been involved in studying a concept that could not be regarded as anything 

new” (1990, p. 489).  Rotter believes this is a result of a lack of common understanding 

of the meaning of locus of control.

In an organization, locus of control can be defined as how employees see the 

control of rewards and outcomes related to organizational variables.  These rewards may 

include promotions, evaluations, career advancement and pay raises.  If an employee 

believes that he or she is in control o f his or her career, and can influence such outcomes 

as raises and evaluations, this employee has an internal work locus of control.  If this 

employee believes that others control such work outcomes as performance evaluations 

and career advancements, this person has an external work locus of control.

Individuals with an external locus of control orientation, as measured by Spector’s 

(1988) Work Locus of Control Scale, have a higher likelihood of reacting to 

organizational frustration with displays of counterproductive behavior (Storms &

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


32

Spector,  1987).  Recently, Heacox (1996) found, that in combination with other 

organizational characteristics, external locus o f control, as measured by the Work Locus 

of Control Scale was a predictor o f frustration.  As a sole predictor, locus of control 

accounted for 11% o f the variance in frustration.

As summarized by Pareek (1982), there are several generalizations that can be 

made about “ internalization” (internal locus o f control orientation).  Internalization plays 

a role in the learning process, is related to perseverance, and is related to achievement 

motivation; it is also related to moderate or calculated risk taking.  Those with an internal 

orientation prefer a participatory management style and may perceive more control over 

the way they spend their time at work.  Because prior research indicates that employees 

with an internal  locus of control are more satisfied with their jobs than employees with an 

external locus of control (Spector,  1982), the generalizations made by Pareek (1982) 

about employees with an internal sense of control, further support the predicted 

relationship between locus of control and quality of work life in the current study.

White and Konoske (1989) report a significant relationship between the 

perception that work-related problems exist at a level in the organization where they can 

be solved with input from the work group, and self-reported measures of the effectiveness 

of an El activity (quality circles) in achieving certain outcomes.  These outcomes include 

improved worker satisfaction, increased work force involvement, improved service 

quality, and improved employee analytic skills.  This perception of the ability to have

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without perm ission.


33

control over the work group’s outcomes is similar to one’s work locus of control 

orientation.  If work group members perceived the organizational problems to exist 

somewhere other than in an area they can affect in their organization, they can be 

described as having an external orientation.  If work group members perceived the 

organizational problems to exist somewhere where they can have control over the 

solution, they can be described as having an internal orientation.  In the White and 

Konoske study (1989), the more the participants perceived the level o f control of 

problem-solving to be close to them (internal), the greater their perception was of quality 

circle outcome achievement, although the perception of problems existing close to the 

work group level was not significantly related to an objective measure of quality circle 

effectiveness.  This finding also indicated that there may be differences between objective 

and self-reported measures of El program effectiveness.  However, the perception that 

work-related problems are existing at a level within the control of the work group (similar 

to internal locus of control), did affect the relationship between employee involvement 

activities and their desired outcomes.

In a review of the relevant literature, Spector (1988) summarized the relationship 

o f  locus of control with work-related outcome variables:  "Internals tend to be more 

satisfied with their jobs than externals, see their supervisors as higher on consideration 

and initiating structure, report less role stress, perceive more autonomy and control, and 

enjoy longer job tenure" (p. 335).  There may also be differences between internals and

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited  without  perm ission.


externals in their career choices.  Liberty, Bumstein, and Moulton (1966) found that 

males who had an external locus o f control preferred jobs which emphasized prestige 

values rather than the degree o f competence necessary for the job.  Males who had an 

internal orientation preferred occupations with a lower prestige level, relative to the 

occupational competency requirements.  Males with an external orientation desired high 

status but did not feel they could achieve it on their own.  In a study examining the 

differences in vocational maturity (attitudes and behavior appropriate for a particular 

stage of vocational development) of women with different levels of locus of control 

orientation, Gable, Thompson, and Glanstein (1976) found that women who had an 

internal orientation had significantly higher vocational maturity than those with an 

external orientation.  However, Lokan, Boss, and Patsula (1982) also found that internals 

were higher on aspects of vocational maturity than externals, but did not find significant 

differences between males and females.

Blau (1993) noted that the personnel selection literature reports that individual job 

performance is better predicted from ability tests than it is from motivational and 

personality measures.  However, results have shown (Day & Silverman,  1989) stronger 

relationships between specific personality measures and work performance outcomes. 

Blau (1993) stated:

A full application of Fisher's (1980) argument for testing personality-performance

relationships means that researchers need to consider the 'fit' between personality

R eproduced with  perm ission  of the  copyright  owner.  Further reproduction  prohibited without perm ission.


35

measures and performance outcomes to obtain maximum predictability.  Previous 

personality-performance research has often neglected this fit issue,  (p.  125)

The results of Blau’s (1993) study confirmed Fisher’s (1980) argument.  Using Spector's 

(1988) Work Locus of Control Scale, the study found a tighter 'fit' between personality 

measures and organizational performance than it did when it examined the relationship 

with Rotter's (1966) general Locus of Control Scale.  Blau (1993, p.  136) stated, "The 

results of this study support Weiss and Adler (1984) that it would be premature to 

conclude that personality variables do not have a systematic effect on employee 

outcomes".  However, research has shown that personality characteristics such as locus of 

control may actually function as moderators of the relationship between organizational 

variables and work attitudes rather than influencing them directly (Hackman & Oldham, 

1980; Wanous,  1974).  For example, Chamblis and Murray (1979) found an interaction 

between locus of control, as measured by Rotter's (1966) Locus o f Control scale, and self- 

efficacy in a study examining smoking cessation.  Those who had both an internal locus 

of control orientation and high self-efficacy had the greatest reduction in smoking 

behavior.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the role of locus of control in the 

relationship between employee involvement activities and perceptions o f quality of work 

life.  Empirical methods were used to investigate the role locus o f control plays in this 

relationship and to see if it, indeed, acts upon the relationship as a mediator variable, as

36

suggested by Coye and Belohlav (1995) and implied from the Lawler (1986) approach. 

Further, this research examined an alternative model proposing that locus o f control 

affects this relationship as a moderator rather than a mediator.

This study was done in an attempt to develop a theoretical framework to help 

guide future research as well as to further the understanding of how an individual 

difference variable affects the outcomes of El programs.  “Understanding factors 

associated with workers’  inclination to participate in employee involvement programs can 

contribute to program success”, as stated by Miller and  Prichard (1992, p. 414).  This 

research addressed some of the unanswered questions in the literature and can help 

researchers to better understand individual differences such as locus of control, and how 

they may affect outcomes of organizational interventions such as employee involvement 

programs.  The more we understand how and why these programs work, the more we 

may assist in the management of effective involvement programs (Geehr, Burke, &

Sulzer,  1995).  If organizations can help foster individuals' internal locus of control 

orientations through specifically designed training and self-development programs, El 

activities may have a greater success rate. The more an organization understands which 

outcomes to expect from the implementation of these programs, the more wisely it may 

be able to use its resources toward achieving the desired organizational behavior.

CHAPTER III 

METHODS AND PROCEDURES

Subjects

Ninety-three subjects participated in this research.  Because of missing responses, 

82 surveys were included for data analysis.  Participants in this research were selected 

from adults who were currently employed at least half-time (20 hours per week) with an 

organization.  Data were included for analysis from those subjects who had been in the 

same position with their current employer for at least three months.  Eighty subjects were 

selected from the population of people at a train station, and riders on a train from San 

Diego to Los Angeles and back from Los Angeles to San Diego.  In addition,  13 

analyzable surveys were included from a Southern California publishing organization. 

The results of an analysis of variance comparing the two subject pools on locus of control 

orientation and quality of work life showed that the difference was non-significant (p>.3) 

and therefore justified combining the data for the purpose of analysis.  Overall, by using 

various occupations o f adult workers from the general population as participants, the 

results of this research have greater generalizability to the general population o f working 

adults.

Procedures

Individuals were approached by a researcher and asked if they were willing to 

participate in a study designed to examine employee involvement programs.  Individuals 

who met the two primary criteria for participation (employed at least half-time for at least 

three months with current employer) were then given the measures to complete.  The 

subjects from the previously noted organization completed the measures as a group 

during their work day and were otherwise given the exact same instructions and treatment 

as the other subjects.  All of the subjects were informed that participation was strictly 

voluntary and that if they decided to volunteer, they had the option to withdraw at any 

time during the approximately  15 minute process without any negative reaction from the 

members of the research team. A few individuals did decline to participate.  Those who 

decided to participate were asked to read and sign a consent form (see Appendix A) and 

were  given the research instrument and a pen for immediate completion.  At completion, 

each participant was thanked for his or her time, handed one California Lottery 

“Scratcher” ticket, and debriefed.

Experimental Variables and Controls 

Independent Variables.  The research design of this study included two independent 

variables, employee involvement and locus of control orientation.  Both of these are 

continuous variables; individuals can possess various levels of each.

39

Dependent Variables.  The research design of this study included one dependent variable, 

quality of work life.  This is a continuous variable; individuals can possess various levels 

of it.

Additional Variables.  The following demographic information believed to possibly affect 

the relationship between the hypothesized variables were included:  gender, age, primary 

cultural identification, education, occupation, size of organization, and work-setting.

Measurement

The primary instrument administered for this study was a survey consisting of 

scales to measure the variables o f interest in the design.  The instrument was modified 

based on feedback and reactions from participants in an initial pilot testing 

administration.  The survey consisted of four sections, section one measured employee 

involvement, section two measured work locus of control, section three measured quality 

of work life, and section four measured the demographic variables (see Appendix B). 

There were a total o f seventy-six items in the survey which took approximately  15-20 

minutes for participants to complete.

Employee Involvement

Employee involvement was measured using a modification of the method 

developed by Lawler, Mohrman, and Ledford (1995).  The degree to which an individual

participates in employee involvement activities was determined by the calculation of an 

employee involvement index score.  Lawler et al. (1995) state, "the employee involvement 

index score was obtained by averaging the index score for each of the four constituent 

elements o f employee involvement—that is, information, knowledge, rewards, and power. 

Each of the four indices was weighted equally" (p.  179).  Accordingly, in the current 

study an index of employee involvement was calculated by averaging an individual's 

score on the four indices.

The items were originally designed to be answered by senior management in an 

organization who would respond by indicating the percentage of employees in their 

particular organization who are offered participation in the specified El activity.  For 

purposes o f this study, participants responded to each item by stating the extent to which 

they have participated in each listed El activity themselves.  Therefore, the items were 

slightly modified from their original format.  Each item was rated on a 

6-point scale with  1= "little or no extent" to 5= "very great extent".  A "don't know" 

response choice was included as response option 6 and was scored as missing data in the 

few cases where it was chosen as a response.  For example, an item that was originally 

worded as:

About how many of your corporation’s employees are currently involved in each of 

the following innovations or Programs?

[1] Little or No Extent 

[2]  Some Extent  [3] Moderate Extent

Lawler et al. (1995) used a specific procedure in the development of the employee 

involvement scales.  Standard statistical procedures such as factor analysis and internal 

consistency reliabilities were used to identify organizational practices that are indicators 

of the same construct.  These items were averaged into scales or subscales.  Items were 

chosen which were relevant to the four parts of employee involvement.  These items were 

"strongly relevant theoretically and were at least to some extent related statistically to the 

other items in that index" (p.  178).  Another measure of El, the PIRK, developed by 

Loma Inc.  in  1994 was not used for this study because it is designed to assess an 

individual's perception of his or her organization’s El culture which may result from the 

implementation o f El activities.  In this study, El was conceptualized as an individual's 

own experience with participation in actual and available activities related to El 

programs, rather than one’s perception of the organizational culture.

Locus of Control

Locus of control was measured using the Work Locus of Control Scale (WLCS). 

This is a measure of generalized control beliefs in a work setting (Spector,  1988).  Much 

o f the organizational literature examining locus of control has used Rotter's Internal- 

External (I-E) scale (1966).  As measured by the I-E scale, locus of control is a 

generalized construct.  The Work Locus o f Control scale is a domain-specific measure. 

The I-E scale may not allow situation-specific predictions.  It is sampled from a wide 

domain of situations and may not have a high internal consistency reliability.  Locus of 

control scales which are domain-specific are preferable to general scales when examining 

how people behave in organizational environments (Orpen,  1992).  The WLCS focuses 

on organizational examples as manifestations of locus of control.  The scale contains  16 

items phrased as statements.  Similar to the Rotter scale, this scale was designed so low 

scores would represent intemality.  However, this was reversed for the current study to 

remain consistent with the direction of the hypotheses and to reduce the likelihood that 

respondents may not have noticed that the survey’s response scale changes directionally 

in the different sections of the overall survey instrument.  The result, consistent with the 

rest of the scales on the survey, was that high scores would now represent more of the 

variable, in this case more intemality.  Participants responded  to the items which were a 

6-point Likert-like scale, now w ith " 1  = disagree very much" to "6 = agree very much". 

For calculation of each respondent’s Work Locus of Control Score, select items were

43

reverse scored due to the nature of the item wording, as recommended by Spector (1988). 

Each respondent’s score was calculated by taking the mean of all sixteen items in the 

scale.

The original validation study of the scale included  1165 employees from a cross- 

section of occupations in the U.S. and there was a mean inter-item correlation of .25. 

Spector found the average coefficient alpha across 6 samples to be .83.  The alpha 

coefficients ranged from  .75 to .85.  Further, Spector  found that the scale correlated an 

average of .54 with the Rotter (1966) I-E scale.  This correlation indicates that this 

domain-specific measure correlates with the generalized construct from which it was 

developed, supporting its construct validity (Spector,  1988).  Because the WLCS allows 

for more situation specific predictions, it can be used to predict work behavior with 

greater accuracy than general locus of control scales. It has been suggested that the scale 

consists of two distinct factors:  internal and external, and that separate scores for internal 

and external orientation should be calculated (HoffMacan, Trusty, & Trimble,  1996). 

However, according to Spector, Van Katwyk, Brannick, and Chen (1997) this two-factor 

structure is just an artifact attributed to item characteristics and the patterns o f subject 

responses.  These artifacts can be produced in the absence o f multiple constructs. 

Therefore for purposes o f the present study, WLCS scores were treated as one dimension 

as originally suggested by Spector (1988).

As expected, scores on the validation sample indicated no relationship with social

desirability, demonstrating divergent validity of the measure.  Further, Blau (1993) found 

no significant relationships between scores on the work locus of control scale and 

demographic variables such as age, gender, race, or education as found with the Rotter 

44

measure (1966).

Quality of Work Life

The quality of work life index used for this study was designed to assess the 

degree to which respondents evaluate their overall work life experiences in a positive 

manner.  Quality of work life, was measured using the General-Attitudes module from 

the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (MOAQ), originally developed 

by Lawler, Cammann, Nadler, and Jenkins in  1975.  Organizational surveys are included 

in most assessments of QWL (Kerce & Booth-Kewley,  1993).  As stated by Cammann, 

Fichman, Jenkins, and Klesh (1983), "The MOAQ is designed to provide information 

about the perceptions of organizational members" (p. 71).  The MOAQ consists of 

various modules which are designed to encompass a variety of organizational issues.  The 

measure was developed so individual items could be modified to better reflect the 

intended context of each administration.  Each module could be dropped, used, or 

shortened as required by the individual researcher for each particular study so it may be 

more suitable for one’s particular needs.  Module  1  o f the MOAQ, The General-Attitudes 

Module, consists of 28 multiple-choice Likert-like items which measure outcomes and

45

psychological states that are relevant to quality of work life issues in most organizations. 

This module "is well suited to the assessment of individual-level attitudes and beliefs" 

(Kerce & Booth-Kewley,  1993, p.  198).  As an overall indicator o f quality of work life, as 

defined in this study, Module  1  consists of the following eleven scales:  1. Overall job 

satisfaction - an indication of overall affective response to a job.  2. Job involvement- the 

extent to which an individual personally identifies with his or her work.  3. Intention to 

turnover- an individual’s intention to continue to be an organization member.  4.  Internal 

turnover desire- an individual’s desire to move to another job in the same organization.

5.  Internal work motivation- the extent to which doing the job itself is rewarding.  6. Self- 

report o f effort- the amount o f energy an individual puts into his or her job.  7.  Overall 

task quality index - the extent to which the tasks within the job provide challenge, 

meaning, and responsibility.  8.  Organizational involvement- the extent to which an 

individual personally identifies with his or her organization.  9.  Pay attitude summary 

index- the extent to which an individual views his or her pay as satisfactory in amount, 

equity, and how it is administered.  10.  Pay based on performance belief- the extent to 

which an individual believes his or her pay is dependent upon job performance.  11. 

Locking-in - an individual’s  perception o f the ability to leave the job situation should he 

or she wish to do so.  The measures in the general-attitudes module are intended for use 

as dependent variables in relational analyses.  Table  1  displays the internal consistency 

reliability estimates from the original validation sample (Lawler et al.,  1975) for each of

46

the scales which comprise Module  1.

There are no additional reported psychometric properties such as further 

reliability or validity estimates for the General-Attitudes module.  However, as stated by 

Cammann et al. (1983), "each researcher needs to examine the empirical and theoretical 

validity of our measures in the context of his or her own projects and adapt the 

instruments appropriately if the best results are to be achieved" (p.  117).  The MOAQ has 

no final form and should therefore be modified for each particular administration.

The original module contains a seven point response scale.  For purposes of 

this study however, the response scale was modified to a six point scale.  A “neutral” or 

mid-point response choice can be non-usable because it cannot be quantified as either a 

“positive” or a “ negative” score.  Further, respondents can have the tendency to choose 

the mid-point to be in the perceived average.  The 6-point Likert-like scale ranges from  1 

= "disagree very much" to 6 = "agree very much".  Each participant’s QWL score was 

determined by averaging his or her scores across all items to arrive at a composite QWL 

score.  Higher scores indicate a higher evaluation of one’s overall quality of work life.

For each of the scales included in the instrument, any item that was negatively worded 

was reverse-scored prior to the calculation of each participant's QWL score.

Certain demographic variables believed to be related to work locus of control 

and/or QWL were additionally measured in the questionnaire.  In addition to discussing 

the importance of asking demographic questions such as age, gender, educational level 

and cultural background when measuring quality of work life, Kerce and Booth-Kewley 

(1993) state that "other important demographic measures are those defining the

individual's place in the organization — including such aspects of organizational 

membership as tenure, department, or division -- and position held" (p.  199).  Age 

category, gender, primary cultural identification, and highest educational level attained 

were determined by responses to the respective items on the questionnaire;  as were 

aspects of organizational membership which included one question for occupation and 

one for work-setting.  The occupational category response choices were:  Skilled 

Trade/Laborer/Construction, Clerical/Administrative Support, Technical, 

Supervisor/Manager, Professional, and Other.  The response choices for the work setting 

question were: Government Non-Profit, Government Profit, Private Non-Profit, Private 

For Profit, and Public Sector (other than government) Non-Profit.

Statistical Design

Hypothesis  1  (H I).  There will be a significant relationship between an employee’s 

opportunity to participate in employee involvement activities and his or her quality of 

work life, such that the more an employee has the opportunity to participate in the 

activities, the greater the employee will perceive his or her quality of work life.  This 

hypothesis was tested by the calculation of a Pearson product-moment correlation 

coefficient between the employee involvement index score and the quality of work life 

score.

49

Hypothesis 2 (H2)

There will be a significant relationship between an employee’s work locus of 

control orientation and his or her quality o f work life, such that those with a more internal 

orientation will perceive a higher quality o f work life.  This hypothesis was tested by the 

calculation o f a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the work locus 

of control score and the quality of work life score.

Hypothesis 3a (H3af

There will be a significant interaction between the opportunity to participate in 

employee involvement activities and locus of control orientation, such that there will be a 

stronger relationship between the opportunity for participation in employee involvement 

activities and perception of quality of work life for employees with a more internal  locus 

of control orientation.  This hypothesis was tested using a moderated regression analysis. 

The criterion variable, quality o f work life, was regressed on employee involvement, 

work locus o f control, and on the employee involvement by work locus o f control 

interaction term.  If the interaction term accounts for a significant proportion of the 

variance in quality of work life above and beyond the individual contributions of 

employee involvement and locus of control, this hypothesis will be supported.

50

Hypothesis 3b (H3t0

Work locus of control will mediate uie relationship between the opportunity to 

participate in employee involvement activities and an employee’s perception of quality of 

work life.  This hypothesis was tested using the method o f analysis suggested by Baron 

and Kenny (1986), to assess the impact o f a potential mediator variable.  The first step is 

to regress the mediator, work locus of control, on the predictor variable, employee 

involvement.  The second step is to regress the criterion variable, quality of work life, on 

the predictor variable, employee involvement.  The third step suggested by Baron and 

Kenny, is to regress the criterion variable, quality of work life, on both the predictor, 

employee involvement, and proposed mediator, work locus o f control.  If these 

relationships are established as outlined above, and if in the third step, the effect of 

employee involvement on quality of work life is significantly less after controlling for the 

effects of the work locus of control, the proposed variable has mediated the relationship 

and Hypothesis 3b will be supported.  If the predictor variable has no effect on the 

criterion variable when the proposed mediator is controlled statistically, then complete 

mediation has occurred.

CHAPTER IV 

RESULTS

The results reported in this chapter are presented in the following order: an 

overview of the demographic profile of the subjects, the descriptive statistics and results 

of the reliability analyses of the measurement scales, the results o f the tests of the 

research hypotheses, and the results of post hoc analyses.

Demographics.  Of the eighty-two useable surveys returned, 41  (50%) were from 

female respondents, and 41  (50%) were from male respondents.  Approximately three- 

fourths o f the respondents (76%) were under 41  years of age.  Figure 5 displays the 

frequency of responses for each age category.  Thirty-eight percent of the respondents had 

some college as their highest level o f education obtained, while approximately one-fourth 

(24%) had at least a 4 year college degree.  While 35 percent worked in either a skilled 

trade, as a laborer, or in a clerical/administrative support position, almost one-half (48%) 

were supervisors, managers, technical or professionals.  Figure 6 displays the frequency 

of responses for each occupational category.  Approximately 70% worked in the private- 

sector, while, the remaining one-third (30%), worked either in the public-sector or the 

government.  A majority (65%) were employed by organizations with more than 50

employees.  Approximately 60% reported their ethnic group as White, 23% as 

Hispanic/Latino, 5% as Black/African American, and 5% as Filipino.  The remaining 5% 

identified themselves as either Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern, or ‘Other’.

The appropriate statistical analyses were conducted for each o f the demographic 

variables to see if there were any systematic relationships to, or group differences on any 

of the variables in the hypotheses.  Age category was treated as a continuous variable and 

was the only variable to correlate significantly with any of the variables.  There was a 

significant correlation between age category and work locus of control, r = .40  {p <.001).

Reliability of the measures.  Prior to statistical analysis of the research 

hypotheses, internal consistency reliability analysis (Cronbach’s coefficient alpha) was 

performed for each scale.  Cronbach’s coefficient alpha is an estimate of the internal 

consistency reliability of a test, based on the interrelationship of its items (Ghiselli, 

Campbell, & Zedeck,  1981).  The employee involvement index scale had a coefficient 

alpha o f .92 (N=82), and an average inter-item correlation of .32, with a range of inter­

item correlations o f .92.  The work locus o f control scale had a coefficient alpha of .74 

(N=82), and an average inter-item correlation of .15, with a range o f inter-item 

correlations of .87.  This coefficient alpha value is a bit lower than the range of values 

(.75 to .85) found by Spector (1988).  The quality of work life scale had a coefficient 

alpha o f .89 (N=82), and an average inter-item correlation of .23, with a range of inter­

item correlations of 1.10.  It was determined that these reliability estimates were high 

enough to proceed with data analysis to test the research hypotheses.

Factor Analysis.  To examine the extent to which the measurement scales in the 

questionnaire were independent of one another, the variables were factor analyzed.  A 

principal components extraction (varimax rotation) was conducted on the items of the 

thirteen subscales of the questionnaire.  The resulting three factor solution which 

accounted for 61% of the variance, and the eigen values and percentages of variance 

accounted for is presented in Appendix D.  One subscale did load on more than one factor 

with eigen values greater than four.  The QWL subscale Intention to Turnover loaded on 

Factors  1 and 3.  However, overall this three factor solution suggests that the 

questionnaire measured separate dimensions as intended, which supports both the 

convergent and divergent validity of the three measurement scales.

Analysis.  According to Tabachnick and Fidell (1989), regression is often used for 

a covariance analysis where the predictor variables are examined after the effects of

another I.V. (the covariate) have been taken into account.  This is done by entering the 

covariate into the regression equation on the step prior to the independent variable.  The 

covariate can also be statistically controlled in the calculation of a correlation coefficient. 

Therefore, to hold the effect o f age category constant, it was partialed out of each of the 

analyses to test the hypotheses.3  Its effect is reported as the first step in each regression 

summary table as appropriate.

In addition, a power analysis was conducted for each hypothesis, to determine an 

estimate of the ability to detect the effects of the variables.  The ability to detect true 

differences is important because it helps minimize the probability of Type II error (the 

probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis; Keppel,  1991).  For each hypothesis 

it was determined that there was a desirable level of power associated with each 

respective effect size (reported in results section) and sufficient sample size to indeed 

detect true differences if they existed.  The p  value presented for each analysis represents 

the probability that the relationship between the two variables could have occurred by 

chance alone.  However, the squared correlation coefficient (R2) indicates the size or 

magnitude of the effect (Keppel,  1991).  Thus, it indicates the proportion of variance 

explained.  For each analysis, the R2 is reported.  However, according to Cohen (1987), 

“The fact is that the state of development of much o f behavioral science is such that not

3This was done because of the significant relationship of age with the other 

variables.  When these relationships were analyzed without controlling for age, the results 
were not significantly different: age had no effect on the observed relationships.

very much variance in the dependent variable is predictable” (p.  78).

Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1

Hypothesis  1  predicted that employee involvement would be positively related to 

perception of quality of work life.  This hypothesis was tested with a Pearson product- 

moment correlation coefficient analysis, controlling for age category.  Quality of work 

life was correlated with employee involvement with age partialed out, the correlation was 

.44 (p <.001).  As hypothesized, employee involvement was significantly and positively 

related to quality of work life, such that the more an employee was involved in activities 

related to an El program, the greater the employee reported his or her quality of work life 

to be.  This R2 of .19 suggests that  19% of quality of work life variance could be 

attributable to a person’s level of employee involvement with age category held constant. 

The size of the squared correlation coefficient approached a “large” effect size for 

Hypothesis 1  (.19) according to Cohen’s criteria for the relative size of squared 

correlation coefficients.  Therefore, Hypothesis  1  was supported.

Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis 2 predicted that work locus of control would be positively related to

58

perception of quality of work life.  This hypothesis was tested with a Pearson product- 

moment correlation coefficient, controlling for age category.  Quality of work life was 

correlated with work locus of control and the partial correlation controlling for age 

category was .34 (p <.01).  As hypothesized, work locus o f control was significantly and 

positively related to quality o f work life.  The proportion of the variance in quality of 

work life that was predicted from work locus of control was  12%.  This R2 suggests that 

12% of quality of work life variance could be attributable to one’s work locus of control. 

The size of the squared correlation coefficient was considered a “medium” effect size for 

Hypothesis 2 (.12) according to Cohen’s criteria for the relative size o f squared 

correlation coefficients.  Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was supported.

Hypothesis 3a

Hypothesis 3a predicted that work locus of  control would moderate the 

relationship between employee involvement and quality of work life.  This hypothesis 

was tested with a moderated regression analysis.  The relationship between employee 

involvement and quality of work life, when controlling for age category, has already been 

established (r =.44) in Hypothesis  1; employee involvement was an independent 

predictor of quality of work life.  In the next step, quality o f work life, the criterion 

variable, was regressed on both of the other variables, employee involvement, the

quality of work life was regressed on the interaction term of employee involvement by 

work locus of control (formed by multiplying their respective standard scores) to test for 

moderation effects.  After age category was entered into the equation at the first step to 

hold its effect constant, employee involvement was entered into the equation together 

with work locus o f control.  This predictor block was significant, R = .61, F(3  78)=  15.42, 

p<.001, R2= .37.  In the next step, when the interaction value of employee involvement 

by work locus of control was entered into the equation, the R2 change was minimal and 

not statistically significant.  Because the interaction term did not increment significantly 

above and beyond what employee involvement and work locus of control individually 

predicted, Hypothesis 3a was not supported.  Table 3 provides the summary results of the 

moderated multiple regression analysis.

Hypothesis 3b

Hypothesis 3b predicted that work locus of control would mediate the relationship 

between employee involvement and quality of work life.  To support this, the relationship 

between employee involvement and quality of work life should be significantly reduced 

when the variance associated with work locus of control is taken into account.  A multiple 

regression analysis was conducted to test this hypothesis using the method of analysis 

suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986) for measurement o f the impact o f a mediator 

variable.  The first step was to regress work locus of control on employee involvement, 

the second step was to regress quality of work life on employee involvement, and the 

third step was to regress the quality of work life on both employee involvement and work 

locus o f control.  If these relationships are established as outlined above, and if in the 

third step the effect of employee involvement is significantly less after controlling for the 

effects of work locus of control, this would indicate that work locus of control has 

mediated the relationship and Hypothesis 3b will be supported.  If the predictor variable 

has no effect on the criterion variable when the proposed mediator variable is controlled 

for statistically, then complete mediation has occurred.

In the first step, work locus of control was regressed on employee involvement 

while holding the effect of age category constant and the correlation was r= .26, (p<.05). 

The second step to test for mediation was done in testing Hypothesis  1; the relationship 

between employee involvement and quality of work life was significant with r= .44

(/X.OOl).

For the third step, quality of work life was regressed on both the predictor variable 

and the proposed mediator variable, that is, work locus o f control was entered into the 

regression equation first.  Then employee involvement was entered into the same 

equation.  Entering work locus of control into the equation first served to hold its effect 

constant and partial out any variance associated with it.  When WLC was entered into the 

equation, the relationship between employee involvement and quality of work life was 

not reduced to zero by the presence of work locus of control.  The amount of variance 

remaining in quality of work life attributable to employee involvement was still 

statistically significant, AR2= .11, F (3 7g)  13.70,/? < .001.  Therefore Hypothesis 3b was 

not accepted.  However, upon further analysis of the variables in the equation, there is 

support for the occurrence of partial mediation.  Upon entering work locus of control into 

the equation, the partial correlation coefficient o f employee involvement and quality of 

work life was reduced from . 19 to . 11.  That is, the amount of variance in quality of work 

life, attributable to employee involvement was reduced by a significant amount (t (79) = 

9.79,  p< .01) by the presence of work locus o f control.  This change was tested using the 

formula presented by Cohen (1983, p.  57) for testing the significance o f the difference 

between dependent r’s.  Work locus of control, accounted for 8% of the variance in 

quality of work life also attributable to employee involvement (shared variance).  This 

finding of partial mediation should be interpreted with caution, however.  Although the

Post hoc analyses.  To further investigate the proposed relationships, post hoc 

analyses were conducted.  Specifically, the relationships between employee involvement, 

work locus of control and each of the component subscales of the quality of work life 

measure were examined.  Correlation analyses were conducted between employee 

involvement, work locus o f control, and each subscale dimension using the same 

approach as was used in testing Hypotheses  1  and 2.  Multiple regression analyses were

conducted to further explore the proposed moderation and mediation models.  However, 

this time the analyses were done for each QWL subscale (similar to the approach for 

Hypotheses 3 & 4).  Again, each of the demographic variables was examined and age 

category was the only variable found to have differential effects on the hypothesized 

variables.  Age category was held constant in only those post-hoc analyses where its 

differential effects were observed on the specified dependent variable.

Three of the QWL subscales were not examined because they consisted of only 

one item per scale.  One item measurements have low reliability levels which limit the 

validity o f the measurement.  Employee involvement was significantly and positively 

correlated with seven of the eight subscales examined: Job Satisfaction (r = .32, p <.01), 

Job Involvement (r = .38, p  <.01), Intention to Turnover (r = .36, p  <.01), Internal Work 

Motivation (r = .23, p  <.05), Overall Task Quality Index (r = .26, p  <.05), Organizational 

Involvement (r = .28, p  <.01) and Locking In (r = .34, p  <.01).  No significant 

relationship existed between employee involvement and the Pay Attitude Summary Index 

subscale.  Work locus of control was significantly positively related to six of the eight 

subscales examined: Job Satisfaction (r = .30, p  <.01), Intention to Turnover (r = .32, p  

<.01), Internal Work Motivation (r = .46,/? <.01), Overall Task Quality Index (r = .35, p 

<.01), Organizational Involvement (r = .35,/? <.01), and Pay Attitude Summary index (r 

= .43, p  <.01).  No significant relationships existed between work locus of control and the 

Job Involvement or the Locking In subscales.  Table 5 summarizes the bivariate

To further examine the proposed moderation and mediation models, in a manner 

similar to Hypotheses 3a and 3b, regression analyses were conducted to see if work locus 

of control moderated or mediated the relationship between employee involvement and 

each of the QWL subscales. There was no support for the moderation model with any of 

the subscales.  There was support for the mediation model when the subscale Internal 

Work Motivation was the criterion variable. In the final step of the analysis, when work 

locus of control was entered into the regression equation, the relationship between 

employee involvement and internal work motivation was reduced (albeit not statistically 

significant) to a non-significant amount by the presence of work locus of control. 

Therefore, there was support for the full mediation model.  The partial correlation 

coefficient of employee involvement and internal work motivation was reduced from .05 

(p <.05) to .02 {p >.05/  The amount of unique variance in internal work motivation 

attributable to employee involvement was 2% when work locus of control was entered 

into the equation.  Table 6 displays the summary results o f this regression analysis. 

Overall, the effects of employee involvement and work locus of control on each o f the 

QWL subscales varied depending on which subscale was being investigated.  These 

results will be discussed in greater detail in the following chapter.

CHAPTER V 

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to empirically examine and further define the role 

o f locus of control in the relationship between organizational employee involvement 

programs and perceived quality o f work life.  The correlational relationship between 

employee involvement and quality of work life and the relationship between work locus 

of control and quality o f work life were examined.  Additionally, two models were tested: 

one in which it was proposed that work locus of control was a moderator of the 

relationship between employee involvement and quality of work life, and the other in 

which it was proposed that work locus of control was a mediator of this same 

relationship.  Although there was support for only two of the four primary research 

hypotheses, the combined results from the tests o f the hypotheses and post-hoc analyses 

do indicate support for work locus of control as a partial mediator of the relationship 

between El and QWL.

Because it was determined that there was a significant relationship between age 

category and work locus of control and also between age category and quality of work 

life, the variance associated with age was held constant or “partialed-ouf ’ of the analyses. 

Consistent with past findings (Ryckman & Malikiosi,  1975; Luthans,  1989), increases in

age were linearly related to increases in work locus of control (more internal) and higher 

quality of work life.

68

The Employee Involvement - Quality of Work Life Relationship

It was hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between 

employee involvement and quality of work life (HI).  The results supported this 

hypothesis.  Those who had a greater level of participation in employee involvement 

activities also had a higher self-reported quality of work life.  This finding is consistent 

with previous literature (Lawler,  1986; Lawler & Ledford,  1981).  In addition to the 

hypothesized relationship, when controlling for age, post-hoc analyses revealed 

significant relationships between employee involvement and each of the QWL subscales 

except for the Pay Attitude Summary Index subscale.  The subscale with which El 

correlated the highest was Job Involvement, r = .38 (p <.001).  El and Job Involvement 

are two distinct constructs as defined in this study however.  Job Involvement is an 

individual’s personal identification with his or her work as opposed to El, which is the 

extent to which an individual has the opportunity to participate in activities designed to 

promote involvement.  The finding o f the significant relationship may be due to the 

organizational “buy-in” or commitment which often occurs as employees are given a 

greater ability to be involved in organizational decision making as well as critical 

organizational processes.  Vandenberg’s (1996) research supports this explanation o f the

6 9

finding.  An alternative explanation of this finding may also be considered; as an 

individual personally identifies with his or her work, he or she may become more 

interested or active in employee involvement activities.  However, as this was not tested 

in the current study, this alternate explanation is not supported.

In addition, there was a high correlation between El and Job Satisfaction, r = .32 

(p  <.01).  This relationship confirms previous findings and research models (Cammann, 

Fichman, Jenkins, & Klesh,  1983; Lawler & Ledford,  1981).  Much of the El literature 

assumes that increases in job satisfaction lead to other desirable organizational outcomes 

such as increased productivity.  However, Cummings and Worley (1993) disagree with 

the underlying assumptions in the literature that El activities which lead to satisfaction 

will lead directly to productivity.  Rather, they believe that increased job satisfaction 

resulting from El activities can lead to increased motivation which can in turn lead to 

increased productivity.

Post hoc analyses also found a significant relationship between El and Internal 

Work Motivation, r  = .23 (p < .05).  This finding may have been due to the El related 

increases in job satisfaction according to the Lawler and Ledford (1981) model.  Further, 

there was a significant relationship between El and Intention to Turnover, r -  .36 (p 

<.001), indicating that the more active an individual was in employee involvement related 

activities, the less likely he or she was to have intentions to leave his or her organization. 

This finding is also consistent with past research (Lawler,  1986; Lawler & Ledford,  1981;

Vandenberg,  1996).

70

The Work Locus of Control - Quality of Work Life Relationship

It was hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between work 

locus of control and quality of work life (H2). The results supported this hypothesis. 

Those who had a more internal work locus o f control orientation also had a higher, self- 

reported quality of work life.  This finding is consistent with previous research findings 

(Blau,  1993; Orpen,  1992; Spector,  1982).

In addition to the hypothesized relationship, when controlling for age, post-hoc 

analyses revealed significant relationships between work locus of control and each of the 

QWL subscales except for the Job Involvement and the Locking In subscales.  However, 

Reitz and Jewell (1979) did find a relationship between locus of control as measured with 

Rotter’s I-E scale, and job involvement in a survey of workers from six different 

countries.  In the current study, the subscale with which WLC was most correlated was 

Internal Work Motivation, r = .46 (p <.001).  This result may be explained as Spector 

(1982) noted:  internals may have a greater level o f motivation because they perceive 

greater control over their work environment.  Internals may exert more effort toward 

gaining rewards in organizations because they are more likely to believe that the effort 

they exert toward achieving the rewards will be successful.  Because internals may 

display more reward-oriented behavior, they will exhibit greater job motivation.

71

Although not tested in the current study, an alternative explanation for this result may 

also be considered.  Higher levels of internal work motivation may result in the belief of 

greater control over the work environment.  In addition, the current study also found a 

significant relationship between work locus o f control and the QWL subscale Intention to 

Turnover, r = 32 (p <.01).  This relationship indicates that the more internal a person was 

on the WLC scale, the less likely the person was to have intentions to leave the 

organization.  This finding is consistent with past research (Blau,  1993; Orpen,  1992; 

Spector,  1982; Vandenberg,  1996).  When considered with the results of Hypothesis  1, 

this finding may be further explained by the Lawler and Ledford model (1981).  The 

model proposes that one of the outcomes o f El activities, employee well-being and 

satisfaction, am  lead to attraction and retention of employees.  According to the results of 

Hypothesis 1, employees who were more involved in activities related to an El program, 

perceived a higher quality of work life and according to the post-hoc finding, the more 

internal a person was on the WLC scale, the less likely the person was to agree to having 

intentions to leave their organization.  According to both the current findings and the 

predicted relationship from the Lawler and Ledford model, employee involvement 

activities can lead to attraction and retention.4

The results of Hypotheses  1  and 2, and the associated post-hoc analyses, may be

as elements o f QWL.  In the Lawler and Ledford model, employee involvement leads 
to well-being and satisfaction which lead to attraction and retention of employees.

72

further explained by examining The Hackman-Oldham Job Characteristics Model of 

Work Motivation (1976).  Participation in El related activities may have contributed to 

the experienced meaningfulness o f one’s work, the experience of responsibility for work 

outcomes, and the knowledge of results from work activities.  These critical 

psychological states may have led to reports of high QWL.  However, the research design 

of this study did not test this alternate explanation and therefore does not support it.

Work locus of control was also significantly related to the Pay Attitude Summary 

Index subscale, r = .43 ip <.001).  This relationship indicates that individuals who were 

more internal on the WLC scale, to a greater extent, viewed their pay as a satisfactory 

amount and as equitably administered.  According to Lawler (1971) internals have higher 

expectancies that performance will lead to reward, and this makes internals particularly 

fitting for pay incentive programs.  Consistent with Day and Silverman’s (1989) research, 

the results of the current study support the idea of individual differences in a personality 

characteristic as an independent predictor of work-related outcomes.

The Employee Involvement - Quality of Work Life Relationship. Work Locus of Control 
as Moderator Model

One of the models proposed in this research predicted that there would be a 

significant interaction between employee involvement activities and locus of control 

orientation, such that there would be a stronger relationship between participation in 

employee involvement activities and perception of quality o f work life for those with a

73

more internal locus of control orientation (H3a).  This moderation model was not 

confirmed by the results of the analyses or the post hoc analyses using the separate QWL 

subscales as the criterion variable.  This finding indicates that the effectiveness or 

usefulness of employee involvement activities in predicting quality o f work life is not 

dependent on an employee’s work locus o f control orientation.  However, partial 

confirmation of the mediation model indicates that changes in locus of control may be the 

psychological mechanism by which El programs can achieve their desired outcomes.5 

The next section more fully discusses this relationship.

The Employee Involvement - Quality o f Work Life Relationship. Work Locus of Control 
as Mediator Model

One of the models proposed in this research was that work locus of control 

mediates the relationship between employee involvement activities and perception of 

quality of work life (H3b).  The results of the analyses provide only partial support for 

this model.  The relationship between employee involvement and quality of work life was 

not reduced to zero by controlling for work locus of control.  However, the amount of 

variance in quality of work life attributable to employee involvement was significantly 

reduced from .19 to .11, by controlling for work locus of control in the equation.

5As all hypotheses were correlational and no variables were manipulated, this 
finding indicating potential changes in WLC must be interpreted with caution.  This 
mediation is necessary, but not sufficient, to indicate changes in WLC as a result of one’s 
level of EL  There is support of possible WLC changes, not confirmation.

7 4

According to Baron and Kenny (1986) this result should not have been unexpected:

Because most areas o f psychology, including social, treat phenomena that have 

multiple causes, a more realistic goal may be to seek mediators that significantly 

decrease Path c [the relation between the independent and dependent 

variables] rather than eliminating the relation between the independent and 

dependent variables altogether.  From a theoretical perspective, a significant 

reduction demonstrates that a given mediator is indeed potent, albeit not both a 

necessary and sufficient condition for an effect to occur,  (p.  1176)

Therefore, according to Baron and Kenny’s perspective, the current finding that the 

amount o f variance in quality of work life attributable to employee involvement was 

significantly reduced by controlling for work locus o f control, indicates that work locus 

of control did have a strong effect on the relationship between employee involvement and 

quality of work life.

When the mediation model was examined with the various components of quality 

o f work life as the criterion variable, the Internal Work Motivation subscale provided 

support for the full mediation model.  This mediation indicates that the path from El to 

Internal Work Motivation includes work locus of control orientation.  Alternatively, 

research has shown that internals may seek situations in which control is possible 

(Kabanoff & O’Brien,  1980).  This may indicate that people with an internal orientation 

are more likely to get involved in El activities.  However, the results of the current study

75

are not consistent with this alternate account because of the directionality of the 

hypothesis.  Further, an individual's level o f achievement motivation may also be 

considered as an alternative explanation of the findings because of the significant 

correlation between achievement motivation and internalization, and the idea that 

individuals with a high need for achievement may prefer situations (i.e. employee 

involvement activities) which activate the need.  However, because achievement 

motivation was not examined in the current study, this explanation is not supported.

Age Category Findings

Research has consistently shown a significant relationship between age and job 

tenure (Jackson, Brett, Sessa, Cooper, Julin, & Peyronin,  1981).  Similarly, the current 

study found a significant relationship between age and Intention to Turnover; that is, the 

greater the chronological age of the employee, the  less likely the employee was to agree 

to having intentions to leave the organization.  This finding may be explained by 

examining Super’s Theory of Vocational Development (1975).  According to the theory, 

there are five stages of vocational development that individuals go through during their 

careers.  As individuals move through these stages,  they select particular careers that best 

reflect the development o f their self-concept.  These career development stages 

correspond to specific age categories, and as individuals advance through the stages, they 

become less likely to leave a particular job or change professions as they develop a

76

greater self-concept.  The current finding, that the greater the age o f the individual, the 

less likely he or she was to have intentions to leave the organization, supports Super’s 

theory.  However Healy, Lehman, and McDaniel (1995) through meta-analytic 

procedures, concluded that age alone is not a sufficient predictor of voluntary turnover or 

other job-related behavior and organizational outcomes.  In the current study however, 

independent of the effect of each other, El, WLC, and age each predicted turnover 

intention.  It is possible however, that the observed relationship between age and turnover 

intention is to some extent attributable to a cohort characteristic.  Further, the current 

study additionally found that there was no significant relationship between age category 

and EL  However, Miller and Prichard (1992) suggest that workers who are younger may 

be more interested in employee participation because of a possible unfilled need for self- 

expression.

The current study also found a significant relationship between age and work 

locus of control, as well as a significant relationship between work locus of control and 

Intention to Turnover.  The finding that older employees had a more internal orientation, 

may be explained by the greater number o f mastery experiences older workers have had 

due to being further along in their careers.  This explanation is consistent with the 

findings o f Ryckman and Malikiosi (1975).  As skills and self-confidence develop, an 

individual experiences a greater sense of control over work-related outcomes.

Further, the current study found a significant relationship between age and quality

7 7

of work life.  Past research has consistently found a relationship between age and job 

satisfaction (Weaver,  1980).  Older workers generally report higher levels of job 

satisfaction than do younger workers.  As defined in the current study as an element of 

QWL, job satisfaction can therefore partially account for the current finding.  Further, this 

finding may reflect the generally higher career satisfaction often reported by older, more 

established workers.  As an individual’s self-concept becomes more stable with age and 

career advancement, and he or she sense greater control over personal and work related 

outcomes, he or she may be more likely to report a greater quality of work life as defined 

in this study.

Limitations of the Present Study 

Overall, the findings o f this study can be generalized to the population of working 

adults, particularly in organizations located in the Southern California region.  Because 

the data were collected from this geographic area, it may not have been a true 

representation of the adult working population in general.  It is possible that local 

conditions (i.e. economic, social, etc.) may have had an effect on the relationships which 

were examined.  Whenever outcomes such as intention to turnover rates are studied, it is 

believed that local and national economic conditions and job availability in the local 

marketplace can affect these outcomes.

Another limitation on the generalizability o f these results is that a majority of the

78

data was collected from train travelers and work commuters.  There may be some 

characteristic specific to this group that would cause them to respond to items in a 

particular manner; this may have had an effect on the relationships under investigation.

Further, as with many organizational intervention strategies, different 

organizations use different terminology to describe the components of their efforts.  In the 

current study, the level o f employee involvement was measured using specific terms 

which may not have been interpreted with a common understanding by all of the survey 

respondents.  Although it would have significantly increased the time to complete the 

measure, and this could have reduced the response rate or willingness to participate, a 

brief item dictionary or definition list may have helped respondents translate a term such 

as “job skills training” to what they may commonly know of as “on-the-job training” in 

their organization.  Recruiting subjects from a particular organization known to have high 

levels of employee involvement could be a method to facilitate a common understanding 

o f each of the El terms.  Recruiting subjects from the same organization may have also 

insured that each respondent had the El activity as an option in his or her organization. 

This could serve as a more representative indicator of each individual’s actual rate of 

participation.  However, by using a particular organization, a restriction in range due to 

the amount of El actually available in the organization must also still be considered as a

Suggestions for Future Research 

A logical extension of the current research would be to expand the current model 

to examine if and how the outcomes o f QWL or its components may lead to increases in 

productivity.  A feasible approach to follow would be to gather objective performance or 

productivity data.  This information can be gathered through supervisor ratings or through 

statistical process charting techniques.  Individuals can report their subjective 

productivity increases attributable to employee involvement activities and the two data 

sets can then be compared.  Future research studying the role of locus of control or other 

personality components in the workplace is likely to benefit from an alternative 

methodological approach.  Particularly, a longitudinal or pre-post test design may help 

identify causal relationships.  The current research did indicate that a dimension of one’s 

personality as manifested in the workplace, may be the psychological mechanism by 

which employee involvement programs achieve their desired outcomes.  The pre-test 

post-test design could actually measure changes in work-related outcomes such as 

components of quality of work life, and could compare the results o f different approaches 

as well as the impact of different personality dimensions which are believed to be

relevant.

To more fully understand the role of certain individual characteristics in the El - 

QWL relationship it would be prudent to measure other dimensions o f personality such as 

self-efficacy.  By adding self-efficacy to the same theoretical models tested in this 

research, researchers can learn more about the psychological process that occurs between 

the choice to participate in El activities such as organizational decision-making and their 

desired outcomes.  According to Bandura (1997):

With regard to their relationship to behavior, perceived self-efficacy is a 

uniformly good predictor of diverse forms of behavior, whereas locus of control 

is generally a weak or inconsistent predictor o f the same behaviors.  This is not to 

say that outcome expectations have no impact on behavior.  They do, if 

particularized and assessed in relation to the actions that can produce them, (p.20) 

The interaction between self-efficacy and locus of control could prove to be an 

important course for future organizational research endeavors. 

Individuals with an 

internal locus of control orientation may need fewer mastery experiences for 

improvement of efficacy perceptions and performance (Gist,  1987).  One of the 

objectives of future research can be to examine the relationship between self-efficacy and 

locus of control to see if self-efficacy mediates the relationship between locus of control 

and behavior.  Task-specific control can be measured and compared to desired level of 

control within the same El - QWL framework.  It is recommended that this be done with

measures of QWL which are specific to some level o f El action.  An examination of how 

locus of control fits into this framework is warranted.  Because the results of the current 

study may also be explained by the empowerment approach to organizational 

involvement, and because employees can become empowered by the development of 

their sense of self-efficacy (Zimmerman,  1995), future research could benefit from an 

examination of the similarities and differences between El and empowerment and the role 

of self-efficacy.  The employee participation approach is often equated with 

empowerment (Conger & Kanungo,  1988).  However, continuing research on locus of 

control remains important because it may be the mechanism by which El activities 

possibly lead to self-efficacy, which can ultimately lead to desired program outcomes. 

Future research which examines El with an expectancy theory framework, may also 

further explain the psychological process by which employee involvement leads to 

desired outcomes.

Further, experimental designs with pre and post measures such as a work 

simulation exercise may be an advantageous way to examine the relationships proposed 

in this study.  Although experimental designs such as these may be less generalizable, 

there is a greater ability for the researcher to control the research setting and eliminate 

potential confounding variables.  A longitudinal design may be another beneficial method 

to investigate the relationships examined in the current study.  Organizational members 

can have their work locus o f control measured at different points o f time in their career

with a particular organization.  Using this approach may help identify specific aspects of 

employee involvement which may be more suited to affect both changes in locus of 

control and changes in one’s quality of work life.  Future research may also be able to 

address the question:  What is likely to happen to individuals who already have an 

internal orientation when compared to those who have had a shift from external to 

internal due to some employee involvement related experience?  Where will these two 

groups be in relation to each other on both quality of work life and performance or 

productivity?

It has been suggested that the effects of motivational and cognitive mediating 

variables will be increased if leader direction and employee participation in decision 

making are used together in organizations (Sagie,  1997).  Future research can benefit 

from investigating other organizational or situational variables in conjunction with 

employee involvement programs, which are believed to account for variance in an 

individual’s quality of work life.  When the variables with the relatively largest effects 

are identified and tested, the focus o f research and organizational development strategies 

should shift to include them.

Organizational Recommendations 

Overall, the results o f this study suggest that organizations have the ability to 

increase desirable work-related outcomes, through the offering of programs designed to

move critical processes down to lower levels in the organization.  However, organizations 

must be willing to make the necessary commitment to create organizational cultures 

which support all four components of El (power, information, knowledge, and rewards) 

throughout their organizations.  Further, organizations must identify specific, desired 

outcomes to help define the criteria for success of their El programs.  They should not 

expect their El programs to necessarily result in overall improvements in internal or 

external operating conditions.  If organizations have an understanding of what outcomes 

to expect from El programs, they can better design El programs to meet their needs.

The finding that work locus of control to some extent mediated the relationship 

between El and QWL (supporting a model whereby WLC is an explanatory variable in 

the El - QWL relationship) suggests that the extent to which El programs are successful 

is  somewhat dependent upon individual factors which employees possess while on their 

jobs.  When designing El programs, organizations must consider that employee 

characteristics may effect the extent to which these programs are successful.  Research 

has shown that certain El activities are better suited for employees with particular 

characteristics.  According to  Lawler (1971) internals have higher expectancies that 

performance will lead to reward, and this makes internals particularly fitting for pay 

incentive programs.  Gardner, Beatty, and Bigelow (1981) discuss how past literature is 

consistent in finding that persons with an internal locus of control are higher performers.

The results o f the current study indicate that organizations can help employees to

perceive a sense o f personal control by implementing employee involvement programs. 

Further, previous research has found that El programs lead to productivity (Doherty, 

Nord, & McAdams,  1989; Gowen & Jennings,  1990; Larson,  1989).  Because it appears 

that El programs achieve their outcomes through a cognitive process where employees 

develop a sense of control, organizations may wish to consider other methods of 

structuring work experiences to allow employees to develop a sense of control over the 

outcomes.  Past research has found that there are specific techniques that can be used to 

change locus of control from external to internal (Gardner & Beatty,  1980; Lokan, Boss, 

& Patsula,  1982; Pareek,  1982).  Organizations may also implement techniques designed 

to increase efficacy experiences for employees because the lack o f efficacy experiences 

may limit the success of El programs.

Additionally,  factors such as age may affect employee participation in El 

programs.  Organizations may wish to specifically target their El programs at younger 

employees, who as a group have a more external locus of control orientation, and as a 

result may seek ways to achieve control over work-related outcomes.  Further, as a group, 

younger employees generally report lower levels of job satisfaction and higher rates of 

turnover.  Therefore, they are the group that may benefit the most from El programs. 

Organizations may wish to specifically design El programs for entry-level employees 

who in general have less control due to the nature of their position in the organization and 

lack of history o f mastery experiences.  Because the current trend indicates that in the

future the workforce will increasingly be composed of older employees (Coates, Jarratt & 

Mahaffie,  1990), organizations should be aware of the factors that may affect the 

usefulness of programs designed to effect work outcomes.  However, by helping to 

develop an employee early in his or her career through the use o f El programs, an 

organization may benefit from the outcomes throughout the employee’s tenure.

The current study has found that as independent predictors of quality of work life, 

both El and WLC can be useful. This research confirmed Spector’s (1982) finding that 

personality is a useful determinant of behavior in organizational settings.  The literature 

further supports the idea of components of personality or demography as moderators of 

the relationship between job features and work attitudes (Hackman & Oldham,  1976). 

Because the current study found that WLC was related to QWL, it supports Weiss and 

Adler’s (1984) belief that personality characteristics can affect employee outcomes.  The 

results cf the current study can be used to help organizations design and implement 

programs to improve work-related outcomes for employees, which can lead to one of 

their primary operating objectives, productivity.

In the current study, employee involvement explained  19% of the QWL variance, 

and WLC explained  12% of the QWL variance.  As independent predictors of QWL, El 

explained more of the variance than did WLC.  However, because WLC partially 

mediated the El - QWL, and fully mediated the El - Internal Work Motivation 

relationship, the current study indicates support for a model where individual

86

characteristics may be the mechanism by which job characteristics are related to

outcomes such as quality of work life.  According to Hackman and Oldham (1980), and

Wanous (1974), the primary influence of personality on work attitudes is likely as a

moderator.  In the current study however, no moderation effects were found.

In summary, this study found that:

•  

Employee involvement activities are significantly related to quality of work life, 

such that individuals who are more active in El related activities are more likely to 

have a higher self-reported quality of work life.

•  

Work locus of control orientation is significantly related to quality of work life, 

such that as an individual’s orientation is more internal on the WLC scale, he or 

she is more likely to have a higher self-reported quality of work life.

•  

The nature of the relationship between employee involvement and quality of work 

life is such that to a partial extent it is mediated by work locus o f control.  That is, 

when the variance related to work locus of control is taken out o f the relationship 

or statistically removed, the relationship is reduced by a significant amount.  By 

controlling for an employee’s work locus of control, the relationship between 

participation in El activities and an employee’s QWL is significantly weakened.

•  

The nature of the relationship between employee involvement and Internal Work

Motivation is such that, it is mediated by work locus of control.  That is, when the 

effects of an employee’s work locus of control on Internal Work Motivation are 

controlled, the relationship between an employee’s level of participation in El 

activities and his or her Internal Work Motivation is significantly reduced and 

becomes non-significant.

•  

There is no evidence that work locus of control moderates the relationship 

between El and QWL or any of its component parts.

The current study advances the knowledge of the nature of the variables 

hypothesized and their interrelationships by providing support for a research model. 

Because of the observed mediation effects of an individual’s locus of control orientation 

as measured by Spector’s (1988) Work Locus of Control Scale, on the relationship 

between employee involvement and quality of work life and some of its component parts, 

there is now an increased understanding of how and why employee involvement 

programs may achieve their desirable outcomes.  According to the proposed and tested 

mediation model, one of the reasons employee involvement programs can have successful 

outcomes is through their ability to help employees perceive a sense of control over their 

work environment.  This information should prove important to both organizational 

researchers and practitioners when they study, design, measure, and implement 

organizational systems such as employee involvement programs.  In conclusion, as stated

by Wanous (1974) over twenty years ago, “For the future, those interested in applying 

behavioral science knowledge to the practical problems involved in job redesign should 

be careful not to overlook differences among the very individuals whose jobs we are 

trying to change" (p. 622).  The results o f this study indicate that measurement of 

individual characteristics in the workplace as well as situational factors should remain a 

prominent area of interest for organizational researchers.

ABSTRACT

Organizations increasingly use employee involvement (El) activities (techniques 

that share decision-making, information, knowledge, and rewards with employees) as a 

method of improving organizational effectiveness.  One desired outcome of El  is a high 

level o f quality o f work life (QWL), which is an employee’s evaluation of his or her 

overall work experiences.  However, researchers have often ignored the role o f individual 

characteristics such as work locus of control, which may affect the outcomes of El 

activities.  Work locus o f control is the degree to which employees believe their work 

outcomes are determined by their own actions or by others.  This study was conducted to 

better understand correlates of El activities and the process by which El activities achieve 

their outcomes.  The correlations between employee involvement, work locus o f control, 

and quality o f work life were examined, as well as tests of the mediating and moderating 

effects o f work locus of control in the El - QWL relationship.

Subjects completed a questionnaire consisting of scales designed to measure: 

participation in El (Survey of Employee Involvement), work locus of control (Work 

Locus of Control Scale), and quality of work life (MOAQ).  As hypothesized, the more 

an employee was involved in El activities, the greater the employee reported his or her 

QWL to be.  In addition, as hypothesized, employees with a more internal orientation

reported a greater QWL.  The prediction that work locus of control would moderate the 

El - QWL relationship was not supported, however, there was partial support for the 

model predicting that work locus of control would mediate the same relationship.  Post- 

hoc findings indicate support for work locus of control as a mediator of the relationship 

between El and a QWL component, internal work motivation.  The findings of WLC as a 

mediator, indicate that WLC may be an explanatory variable in the relationship of El and 

QWL.

Overall, the findings indicate that an individual characteristic and a job 

characteristic are related to a person’s quality of work life and that WLC may be an 

explanatory variable in the relationship of El and QWL.  Organizational and research 

implications of the findings are discussed.
