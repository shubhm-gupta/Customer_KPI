Using Japanese firm-level data, we identify and quantify the factors that influence the
environmental management of Japanese firms. We measure 14 different aspects of a
firm's environmental management and investigate how firm-level characteristics and
external pressures affect the quantity and effectiveness of environmental management
systems and structures. Our results show that one consequence of the growth in
international trade and FDI
is that Japanese firms are increasingly aware of their
environmental obligations and that both regulatory and non-regulatory factors play a role
in a firm's decision to quantify and manage the impact their activities have on the
environment.

Introduction

In recent years corporations over the world have become
increasingly aware of the environmental damage associated
with their activities and have, sometimes reluctantly, made
efforts to lessen this damage. The pressure for firms to employ
appropriate structures and systems to control pollution comes
from both formal and informal sources (see Pargal and
Wheeler, 1996). The former are those usually defined by law
and enforced by regulators. The latter encompass the pres-
sures exerted by, for example, non-governmental organisa-
tions,
local communities and market agents such as
consumers and investors.

In a developed country such as Japan these pressures have
resulted in significant reductions in air pollution over the last
20–30 years (OECD, 1994) despite rapid economic growth over
the same period. However, data provided by Nihon Keizai
Shimbun (2000) together with the results of Nakamura et al.
(2001), indicate that patterns of environmental management
practices across Japanese firms demonstrate considerable dif-
ferences. Some firms have incorporated environmental goals
into the very heart of their decision-making processes while
others appear to largely ignore environmental considerations
or do the minimum required by legislation. For example, the
adoption of voluntary practices such as ISO14001 certification
and the promotion of employee awareness of environmental

practices is relatively patchy. Furthermore, a growing body of
literature suggests that this variation in environmental man-
agement practices is not limited to Japan (see e.g. Gunning-
ham et al., 2003, 2004). A natural question to ask therefore is
what causes these differences across firms.

This paper aims to answer this question by employing a
Japanese firm-level dataset, previously unused for the pur-
poses of economic analysis, to identify and quantify the fac-
tors that influence the environmental management practices
of Japanese firms. Our dataset allows us to examine 14 differ-
ent aspects of a firm's environmental management process,
covering both the management of specific environmental
issues and more general structure and systems management.
We are therefore able to examine all aspects of a firm's envir-
onmental management processes and are not dependent on
far narrower measures of environmental management as, for
example, used by previous studies (e.g. Nakamura et al., 2001).
Specifically, we make the following contributions to the lit-
erature. First, we examine the extent to which a range of firm-
specific factors such as firm size, profitability and the average
age of employees influences environmental management.
Thus, we identify those firm-level characteristics that appear
to encourage and discourage the adoption of a wide range of
environmental management practices. Second we assess the
extent to which factors external to the firm may influence its
environmental management. Specifically we ask whether the
‘forces of globalization’, as captured by participation in export
markets or undertaking foreign investment, stimulates envir-
onmental management. Anti-globalization protestors clearly
see the environment as a victim of free market forces
although globalization may encourage the absorption of inno-
vative technology, expose the firm to greater international
monitoring and generally, perhaps via the role of the media,
increase the public visibility of a firm. By assessing whether
exposure to globalization encourages or discourages the adop-
tion of environmental management practices, we contribute
to the wider globalization and the environment debate (see
e.g. Antweiler et al., 2001; Neumayer, 2001; Cole and Elliott,
2003). Finally, we examine whether the inherent pollution
intensity of the industry to which each firm belongs plays
any role in determining the extent to which environmental
management practices are adopted. We therefore assess
whether firms in more pollution intensive industries are
more or less likely to have sophisticated environmental man-
agement systems.

With regard to the previous literature, theoretically, Sin-
clair-Desgagné and Gabel (1997) demonstrate how firms can
design environmental audits that can improve environmental
management systems without adversely affecting other activ-
ities. Drawing on the organisational management literature,
Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003) argue that the extent to
which a firm's resources and capabilities (which include tech-
nology, managerial skills and attitudes) will affect environ-
mental management is contingent upon a number of factors
including the complexity and uncertainty of the business
environment and the munificence of the firm in question.
Although more numerous, empirical studies that analyse the
determinants of firm's environmental management decisions
are limited. Henriques and Sadorsky (1996) examine the exter-
nal pressure exerted by customers, shareholders and local

communities on firms' environmental performance in Canada
while Levy (1995) examines the relationship between consu-
mers and community pressure groups on the environmental
performance of transnational corporations (TNCs). Gunning-
ham et al. (2003, 2004) continue this theme by arguing that
firms are subject to a ‘social license’, enforced by stakeholders
such as pressure groups and community action groups, which
encourages firms to go beyond minimum standards, often
with regard to reputational consequences. In a related study,
Pargal and Wheeler (1996) examine the impact of informal
factors such as education and income per capita on the emis-
sions of a specific pollutant by Indonesian firms. In addition to
external pressures, firm specific factors have also been shown
to have an impact on a firm's environmental performance.
DeCanio and Watkins (1998), in a study for the US, find that
firm-specific factors such as size and shareholder structure
affect the decision to participate in the Green Light program
(a voluntary pollution prevention program). Also for the US,
Arora and Cason (1995, 1996) show that firm size and industry
effects are important determinants of a firm's participation
decision in the Environmental Protection Agency's 33/50 pro-
gram. In the closest study to our own, Nakamura et al. (2001)
examine the relationship between ISO14001 certification and
firm-level characteristics for Japanese firms. Finally, Gray and
Deily (1996) examine firm-level characteristics and the deci-
sion of firms in the US Steel industry to comply with air pollu-
tion regulations while Cole et al.
(2005b), examine the
determinants of UK industry level emissions.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section
2 reviews the methodology and describes our data; Section 3
presents the results and Section 4 concludes.

Methodology and data

In this paper we merge two firm-level datasets, Nihon Keizai
Shimbun (2000) and Toyo Keizai Shinpo (2000a,b). As far as we
are aware these datasets have not previously been combined.
In this section we outline our main hypotheses and discuss
our dependent and independent variables.

The Nihon Keizai Shimbun (2000) dataset was constructed
from the survey results of a questionnaire that was sent to all
publicly quoted companies and a random selection of major
non-public companies in the Japanese manufacturing sector
and selected non-manufacturing industries (construction and
electricity and gas).1 The survey was conducted between the
beginning of October and the middle of November 1999. The
purpose of the questionnaire was to gather detailed informa-
tion regarding the environmental management practices of
Japanese firms.

In total, data were obtained from 875 firms representing a
response rate of 44%. Of the 875 responses, we were able to
match other firm-level data from Toyo Keizai Shinpo (2000a,b)
to approximately half of them. The result is an overall sample
of around 400 firms. Each of our environmental performance

designated as “dirty” industries based on Mani and Wheeler's
(1998) classification system where an industry is defined as dirty if
it is ranked within the top ten in terms of overall emissions.

indicators is derived from the marks ascribed to the answers
to one of thirteen multi-part questions. To allow comparison
across indicators, each measure is standardised around a
mean of fifty with a standard deviation of ten.2

Thirteen of our fourteen indicators are allocated to one of
two distinct groups with the fourteenth being an overall sum-
mary statistic. The first six relate to the management, and
control, of specific environmental problems. Examples
include the management of total CO2 emissions and the out-
sourcing of the treatment of industrial waste. The other seven
are concerned with the quality of the general structure and
systems that firms employ to handle environmental issues.
Examples include the disclosure of environmental informa-
tion (on products and on the treatment of chemicals) and the
award of ISO 14001 certification. The overall environmental
management performance measure is constructed from a
principal components analysis of the other thirteen indices.
To help interpret the basic scores a firm receives for each
variable it is useful to briefly clarify how the survey results were
constructed. Each indicator is constructed from the answer to
one of thirteen questions, each of which contains a number of
parts, although our data do not allow us to distinguish between
the answers or weightings that are given to the different parts of
each question. However, with the exceptions of Total Industrial
Waste Management, Total Treated Industrial Waste Manage-
ment and Management of CO2 emissions, each indicator is
derived purely from questions relating to environmental man-
agement rather than actual environmental performance. Even
for these exceptions, only one part in six of the question relates
to changes in actual emissions or waste.3

Table 1 provides index numbers for our 14 indicators
grouped by industry. Detailed descriptions of each variable
can be found in Appendix 1. From Table 1 we can see that
firms in the Gas and Electricity and Iron and Steel industries have
the best record for overall management performance while
those firms in Construction, Machinery and Textiles industries
have the worst. What is interesting, however, is that there are
significant differences across industry by indicator, so that an
industry with a high score in one measure may have a rela-
tively low score in another. For example Gas and Electricity has
high scores across the board except for Industrial Waste Out-
sourcing. Likewise, Iron and Steel performs badly on the Land
and Ground Water Pollution Control indicator.

Our additional firm-level characteristics were obtained
from Toyo Keizai Shinpo (2000a,b). The term in brackets is
the variable name used in the regression analysis.

To test the globalization hypothesis, we consider the vari-
ables that relate more generally to the openness of a firm and
how they impact on environmental management. The first

2 The standardisation procedure is 50+10*(X−X¯ /S.D.) where X
is the initial value for each environmental management indicator.
It should be noted that the standardisation applies to our
matched sample of firms and not the 875 replies from the
original survey. The result is that the means are generally greater
than the standardised level of 50. This reflects the fact that the
matching data was biased towards larger firms that, ceteris
paribus, are more likely to have environmental management
systems in place.

variable is Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is hypothesised
that firms that embark on direct investment abroad are more
likely to exhibit higher levels of environmental management.
Possible explanations include (1) that such firms are likely to
employ similar operational standards across countries (Levy,
1995) so that if a Japanese firm invested in a country with
higher regulations then standards would subsequently be
raised in Japan; (2) that overseas affiliates are more likely to
employ advanced technological solutions in order to maintain
a competitive edge and to thus compensate for any lack of
local knowledge (Kindleberger, 1969; Hymer, 1976). This infor-
mation, in turn, could then form the foundation for technolo-
gical
firms may choose to
centralize the environmental management systems of over-
seas affiliates in the source country giving the impression of
strong domestic investment in environmental management
systems; (4) multinational enterprises may be subject to closer
national and international monitoring than domestically
owned firms. FDI is measured as a dummy that equals one if
the firm undertook overseas investment in 1999.

improvements at home;

Our second globalization variable is exports (Exports). It is
hypothesised that those firms that export a certain proportion
of their output are more likely to be influenced by interna-
tional competition and the pervasive forces of globalization
and hence will be more receptive to innovative production
technologies or goods. Similarly, firms that compete in the
global marketplace come under closer international monitor-
ing from the products markets, the capital markets and non-
governmental organisations. The overall effect may be to
encourage good environmental management. Exports are
measured as a dummy that is equal to one if a firm exported
some of its products in 1999.4

The wider globalization and environment literature has
been subject to a number of endogeneity concerns. Specifi-
cally, the standard concern is that trade and FDI are endogen-
ously related to environmental regulations at the national
level i.e. rather than causality moving from FDI to regulations
it may, instead, move in the opposite direction. This can occur
if countries set their regulations artificially low in order to
attract FDI. Moreover, it is possible that foreign owned firms
may lobby governments for lower regulations (or slower
increases) in the future (Damania et al., 2003). We believe this
problem to be minimised in our dataset for the following rea-
sons. First, firms undertake a large proportion of environmen-
tal management practices voluntarily and hence the link
between formal government regulations and firm-level envir-
onmental management is likely to be limited.5 Thus, if levels of
FDI (or exports) influence regulations they may not influence
environmental management. Secondly, we concentrate on
firm-level data and it is unlikely that a firm's decision to invest
abroad or to enter the export market is related to how well it
chooses to manage its domestic environmental obligations.

4 We would ideally lag FDI and exports since their impact on
environmental management is unlikely to be instantaneous.
Unfortunately, data limitations prevent his and hence we are
implicitly assuming that FDI and exports in 1999 were represen-
tative of FDI and exports in years immediately prior to 1999.
5 Although, in principle, regulatory agencies may encourage
firms to adopt certain management practices, as far as we are
aware, Japanese firms are in no way forced to do this.

That said, we do acknowledge that a firm possessing a good
environmental record may be more attractive to global part-
ners or recipients of its exports. Although it is therefore not
possible to state that endogeneity concerns have been
removed we do, however, believe them to be less of a problem
than industry and country level studies that examine the rela-
tionship between the environment and FDI and trade.

In addition to our openness variables we employ a range of
regressors to measure formal and informal factors that may
influence the environmental management practices of Japa-
nese firms. To capture a firm's factor endowments we include
physical capital intensity (PCI). It is hypothesised that the
higher the physical capital intensity of a firm the more likely
it is to have highly capital-intensive and complex production
facilities. This, in turn, provides greater opportunities and
scope for the introduction of clean technologies during the
normal course of upgrading production facilities. Further-
more, there is an additional effect as a result of the estab-
lished positive relationship between PCI and actual emission
levels (see e.g. Antweiler et al., 2001; Cole and Elliott, 2003).
Pollution intensive (and capital intensive) industries would be
expected, therefore, to adopt more stringent environmental
management practices due to the additional demands of reg-
ulators. The expected sign is therefore positive. We measure
PCI as capital stock per worker.

A second endowment variable is human capital intensity
(HCI). Following on from the argument above, it is supposed
that those firms where a large proportion of the workforce is
defined as skilled are more likely to have technologically
advanced and complex production lines, larger R&D divisions
and hence better environmental management systems. More-
over, if such a complex process results in greater emissions
intensity, we may again expect to see a more comprehensive
environmental management system in place. The expected
sign is therefore positive. HCI is measured as total wages per
worker.

The next group of variables is a set of firm specific controls.
First, firm size (Size). Larger firms have a number of potential
advantages over smaller firms when it comes to the introduc-
tion of environmental management systems. Larger firms are
more likely to have the resources and infrastructure to enable
them to dedicate staff to environmental management. Large
firms are also more likely to appear ‘on the radar’ of monitor-
ing organisations which may act as a disciplinary device
(Zarsky, 1999). It is hypothesised that firm size will have a
positive impact on environmental management (DeCanio
and Watkins, 1998; Nakamura et al., 2001). Firm size is mea-
sured by total employment.

It is predicted that the lower the debt ratio (Debt) of a firm
the freer that firm is to employ its capital for environmental
related expenditure. The expected sign on debt ratio is there-
fore negative (Nakamura et al., 2001). The debt ratio is mea-
sured as both long and short-term debt relative to assets.
Related to the increasing public awareness of environmen-
tal issues encouraged by non-governmental organisations
such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, we attempt to
investigate the relationship between public exposure and
environmental performance. It is envisaged that the higher
the marketing expenditure of a firm (Marketing), the stronger
the relationships between the firm and consumers, the

media, and other external stakeholders. An increase in the
value of the firm's brand as a result of marketing activity
means that a firm is more likely to internalize the environ-
mental values held by the general public. The expected sign is
therefore positive. Marketing intensity is measured as the cost
of advertising as a proportion of sales.

It is generally assumed that R&D intensive firms (R&D) are
more likely to be the most technologically advanced. If we
imagine that a certain percentage of R&D expenditure is tar-
geted specifically at the development of clean technologies
then it is supposed that these firms are more able to adopt
technological solutions to environmental problems. It could
be argued that forward looking firms who engage in R&D
generally, would also have environmental management sys-
tems in place to investigate the role of R&D in helping to avoid
regulatory costs. The expected sign is therefore positive. R&D
intensity is measured as the share of R&D expenditures rela-
tive to sales.

To control for the overall economic performance of a firm
we include a measure of productivity (TFP). The more produc-
tive and hence efficient a firm is the more likely it is to have
efficient environmental management systems and structures
in place. The expected sign is positive. Our measure of produc-
tivity is calculated using a Cobb–Douglas production function.6
Similarly, the profitability of a firm (Profits) is included and
is measured as the return on assets. More profitable firms are
assumed to have access to the funds (via retained profits or
capital markets) to make the necessary investments required
to improve environmental management (Nakamura et al.,
2001). The expected sign is therefore positive. Profitability is
measured as a firm's ordinary profit relative to it total assets.
Our penultimate variable is a measure of the average age of
employees (Age) under the premise that younger employees
are generally more trainable, adaptable,
less resistant to
change and perhaps more environmentally aware. As a result,
it is hypothesised that the lower the average age of a firm's
employees, the more likely the firm will be to implement
environmental policies and practices.7 The expected sign is
therefore negative.

Finally we include a Keiretsu dummy (Keiretsu) to capture
the unique corporate structure of some Japanese firms known
as the keiretsu and to see whether being a member of a
Keiretsu has a systematic effect on a firm's environmental
performance. One result of keiretsu membership is that the
firm should have less rigid liquidity restrictions that should
enable the firm to raise sufficient funds to undertake environ-
mental improvements when required (Hoshi et al., 1991).
There may also be positive technological and managerial spil-
lover effects from other firms within the keiretsu so that
member firms share information and make joint business
and investment decisions including the decision to adopt
greener policies and technologies.
In contrast, however,
there may be a competing effect where membership of a
keiretsu adversely affects the efficiency and freedom with
which a firm can operate. Moreover, the strength of the legal

teams and resources available to Keiretsu members may
result in greater lobbying pressures on the Japanese govern-
ment to keep regulations low and to fight any civil or govern-
ment action to impose fines or reduce emissions in the
industry of the Keiretsu firm. The expected sign of the coeffi-
cient is therefore undetermined. Following Fukao et al. (1994),
if the largest percentage of a firm's loan is from the same
main bank for over 3 years then it is considered a keiretsu of
the bank and the firm is given a dummy variable of one.8
In our sensitivity analysis we replace industry dummies
with a dummy variable to capture the inherent dirtiness of
an industry. This allows us to investigate whether, over and
above the effect of other variables, dirty industries tend to
have better environmental management systems than non-
dirty industries. As mentioned above in the context of phy-
sical capital intensity, there is the possibility that dirty indus-
tries face more stringent environmental regulations, are
more visible to external agencies and generally require
more developed environmental management practices due
to the greater volumes of pollution and waste that are ge-
nerated. Appendix 1 provides the list of dirty and clean
industries while Fig. A1 provides the average value of each
environmental management index for firms in both ‘dirty’
and ‘clean’

Table 2 provides a table of means for each variable,
grouped by industry. Table 2 reveals, for example, that the
largest firms are in Motor Vehicles and Gas and Electricity. The
largest debt levels are recorded for those firms in Precision
Instruments and Refined Petroleum Products while marketing
spend is highest for firms in the Food and Beverages, Refined
Petroleum Products and Other Manufacturing Industries. Our aver-
age export variable ranges from a low of 0.04 for Food and
Beverages to a high of 1 for Iron and Steel illustrating the varia-
tion in trade patterns across firms.

Our final estimating equation is therefore:

Total factor productivity and profits were included sepa-
rately to avoid possible co-linearity problems. All estimations
employ OLS analysis with heteroskedastic-robust error
terms. Industry dummies are included to control for industry
specific effects. A correlation matrix is provided in Appendix
1. The nature of the relationships that we are investigating
means that the endogeneity issues that plague the globaliza-
tion and the environment literature are unlikely to be pre-
sent. Subsequently we are able to run standard OLS analysis
without recourse to instrumental variables or complicated
lag structures. Finally, it should be noted that, due to data
limitations, the FDI and export variables are dummy vari-
ables. Although it would be interesting to analyse how the

Results

3.1.

Estimation results

Our results are split into three distinct sections. The first
considers the overall environmental management variable
that also provides the basis for our sensitivity analysis. Our
remaining thirteen environmental management indicators
are split into two groups, those that measure the manage-
ment of specific environmental problems and those that con-
sider each firm's general systems and structure for dealing
with environmental issues.

Table 3 reports the result of an OLS analysis for our overall
environmental management indicator and our six problem
specific variables.9

For our overall environmental management variable
reported as regression (1) in Table 3, the significance of our
explanatory variables is high with the majority of variables
exhibiting significance at the 5% level or better. The results
reveal that the coefficient on FDI is positive and significant,
confirming the expectation that firms that undertake FDI are
more likely to have higher standards of environmental man-
agement. The coefficient on exports is also positive and sig-
nificant reflecting, we believe, the effects of international
competition on the adoption of innovative technologies or
products and the possibilities of greater
international
monitoring.

9 The results for our industry dummies are not included for
reasons of space. In our sensitivity analysis we report the results
of a regression with no industry dummies and others that include
a ‘dirty’ industry dummy.

We now consider our other explanatory variables. Physical
capital intensity (PCI) is a significant and positive determinant
of overall management, implying that firms with more physi-
cal capital
intensity have more advanced environmental
management systems. This concords with prior expectations
and reflects, we believe, the positive correlation found to exist
between pollution intensity and emissions intensity (Antwei-
ler et al., 2001; Cole and Elliott, 2003). Human capital intensity
(HCI) generally has no significant effect. Firm size is strongly
significant and positive as expected. This implies that larger
firms have a greater capacity to invest in mechanisms to
handle environmental concerns. The results also show that
total factor productivity (TFP) has a significantly positive
impact on overall environmental management, suggesting
that efficient firms make greater efforts to lessen their envir-
onmental impact. The ratio of debt to assets, Debt, is negative
and significant as expected under the premise that distressed
companies are less likely to have environmental concerns as a
top priority.

Of the other variables in regression (1), marketing intensity
(marketing) is positive and significant suggesting that firms
with higher marketing intensity are reacting to pressures
from consumers and NGOs to be environmentally friendly or
risk damaging the brand and corporate reputation of the com-
pany. The coefficient on R&D also has the expected positive
and significant sign.

The average age of employees (Age) seems to have little
effect. Finally, our Keiretsu dummy variable is negative and
significant (at the 10% level). The sign on the relationship
between Keiretsu membership and environmental manage-
ment was undetermined although it now seems that such
membership may represent a hindrance to environmental
management perhaps via an inherent inflexibility, or the
bureaucracy, of internal procedures. A second explanation
may be that members of a Keiretsu will have greater access
to legal teams and resources to enable them to fight civil and
government actions to increase regulations or demand lower

emissions. This supports the findings of DeCanio and Watkins
(1998) for US firms while Nakamura et al. (2001) find mixed
results with their Keiretsu dummy largely insignificant.

Of interest in this paper is whether our determinants vary
across indicators. Regressions (2)–(7) consider the environ-
mental management of specific environmental problems. In
terms of openness, only Total Industrial Waste Management
(2) appears unaffected by a firm's entry into export markets or
by the firm's decision to invest abroad. Other interesting
results include the finding that CO2 Emissions Management
(4) and Management of Global Warming (7) are both nega-
tively related to Keiretsu membership (the two indicators
that are given the highest profile by NGOs and consumer
pressure groups outside Japan).

The sign on PCI is also inconsistent across regressions with
unexpected negative coefficients on Total Industrial Waste
Management (2) and Land and Ground Water Pollution Con-
trol (5). Finally, contrary to regression (1), it is interesting to
note that marketing intensity (marketing) is not significant in
any of the other six regressions. Interestingly, Age is signifi-
cantly negative in regressions (2), (4) and (7) giving some sup-

‘younger’

We now turn to Table 4 that considers the determinants of
a firm's environmental system and structures. In most cases
the evidence is supportive of the overall management results
(1). Of particular note is that, like our overall environmental
management indicator (1), for three indicators (10), (11) and
(13), we find marketing to be a positive and significant deter-
minant of environmental management. This suggests that
those firms most concerned about their external image are
those most likely to disclose an environmental statement
(10), disclose a statement relating to chemical treatment (11)
and claim to produce environmental friendly products (13).
The fact that we find the marketing effect to be more signifi-
cant for these ‘structure and systems’ variables compared to
those in Table 3, presumably reflects the fact that the sys-
tems and structures indicators in Table 4 are more general

and more publicly visible. A firm that is keen to present a
positive public image is therefore more likely to ensure that
their environmental systems and structures are suitably
stringent. It is also worth noting that the R&D variable is
generally more significant in Table 4 than Table 3, suggesting
that those firms with the highest levels of R&D tend to have
more developed environmental systems and structures in
place.

Sensitivity analysis

In Table 5 we undertake a range of sensitivity estimations to
test for robustness across our variables concentrating, for
reason of space, on the overall environmental management
variable.10

In regression (15) we replace TFP with a measure of profits
(measured as the return on assets). The results seem to sug-
gest that profits have no significant effect on overall perfor-
mance.11 Regressions (16) and (17) drop FDI and exports
alternately. Both remain positive and significant suggesting
that the openness effect is robust.

To examine the relationship between the dirtiness of an
industry and its environmental performance, regressions (18)

10 Similar tables for other performance indicators are available
from the authors upon request. It is notable that exports generally
have a larger, more significant, effect on environmental manage-
ment than FDI, perhaps reflecting the greater exposure to
overseas competition faced by exporters. A firm that competes
in global markets may have to meet minimum environmental
standards in order to enter certain export markets or may choose
to develop environmental management systems in order to
enhance its reputation. Compared to this mechanism, the
manner in which FDI may influence environmental management
may be less direct and perhaps weaker in magnitude.
11 When profits and TFP are included jointly, profits are usually
negative and significant suggesting that, over and above TFP, a
firm with high profitability has little regard for environmental
related issues.

and (19) split the sample into firms from clean and dirty
industries. It is notable that marketing intensity is only sig-
nificant for firms in dirty industries suggesting that firms that
pollute and have a strong corporate identity spend more try-
ing to give the impression of caring for the environment. Less
clear is why human capital intensity is positive and signifi-
cant for dirty firms only. This explanation may be linked to
the findings of Cole et al. (2005b) who demonstrate, for US
industries, that HCI and pollution intensity are positively
related.

Finally, regression (20) presents the results with no dum-
mies for the full sample, while (21) includes a ‘dirty’ dummy
instead of industry dummies. Regression (20) demonstrates
the robustness of our general results. Regression (21) is gen-
erally supportive of our previous results but does exhibit a
positive and significant coefficient for the dirty industry
dummy. This suggests that, as expected, over and above
the effect of our other explanatory variables, those firms
that pollute the most also have the best overall environ-
mental management. That dirty firms have some of the
best environmental management systems may not be that
surprising as it would appear to be rational behaviour in the
face of increasing environmental regulations and ever-closer
scrutiny from a range of governmental and non-governmen-
tal organisations.

Discussion and conclusions

The results in this paper go some way towards explaining the
differences in environmental management behaviour across
Japanese firms. One of the main results of this paper is the
seemingly positive relationship between our measures of glo-
balization and environmental management. Perhaps one con-
sequence of the growth in multinational activity is that such
firms are becoming increasingly aware of their environmental
obligations. In an information and media-led world, the reper-
cussions for a company that obtains a reputation as an abuser

of the environment can be severe for future profits and even
for the survival of the firm. This is reflected, for example, in
the fact that a firm's expenditure on advertising and brand
building is a positive determinant of environmental
management.

Another inference we can draw from this study is that
governments need to consider two aspects of a firm's envir-
onmental performance. A distinction can be made between
managing a firm's pollution and managing how the general
public perceive the firm's management of pollution. Measures
to encourage a greater take up of ISO 4001 would, for example,
more closely align a firm's aims with its actual environmental
outcomes.

A final point of interest is the generally negative sign
on the ‘Keiretsu’ variable that suggests that the traditional
corporate structure of the Japanese economy may act to
hinder improvements in the environmental management
of Japanese firms. They may reflect an inherent lack of
‘Keiretsu’ members to adapt
flexibility and inability of
quickly to changing public and governmental perceptions
on the importance of environmental
issues. The other
possible explanation is
the financial and legal
resources available to Keiretsu members may enable them
to fight civil and government actions aimed at increasing
regulations or reducing emissions in the firm's area of
business.

that

There is a considerable scope for future research in this
area. Measures of firm-level emissions and more direct mea-
sures of regulations would enable us to examine more closely
the relationship between environmental management and
actual performance.
