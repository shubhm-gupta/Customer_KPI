Objectives: To investigate the determinants of self rated health (SRH) in men and women in the British
Whitehall II study and the French Gazel cohort study.
Methods: The cross sectional analyses reported in this paper use data from wave 1 of the Whitehall II study
(1985–88) and wave 2 of the Gazel study (1990). Determinants were either self reported or obtained
through medical screening and employer’s records. The Whitehall II study is based on 20 civil service
departments located in London. The Gazel study is based on employees of France’s national gas and
electricity company (EDF-GDF). SRH data were available on 6889 men and 3403 women in Whitehall II
and 13 008 men and 4688 women in Gazel.
Results: Correlation analysis was used to identify determinants of SRH from 35 measures in Whitehall II
and 33 in Gazel. Stepwise multiple regressions identified five determinants (symptom score, sickness
absence, longstanding illness, minor psychiatric morbidity, number of recurring health problems) in
Whitehall II, explaining 34.7% of the variance in SRH. In Gazel, four measures (physical tiredness, number
of health problems in the past year, physical mobility, number of prescription drugs used) explained 41.4%
of the variance in SRH.
Conclusion: Measures of mental and physical health status contribute most to the SRH construct. The part
played by age, early life factors, family history, sociodemographic variables, psychosocial factors, and
health behaviours in these two occupational cohorts is modest.

T he single item measure of self rated health (SRH) has

been widely reported to be a predictor of mortality after
adjusting for traditional risk factors, sociodemographics,
and measures of health status.1–4 Reviews on a total of 46 studies
in various settings have found this relation to be robust.5 6
Attempts to unravel this association in the past have focused on
controlling for a wide variety of risk factors: family history,7
measures of health,2 8–12 chronic diseases,4 7 8 12–19 functional
ability,7 10 12 14 17 19–21 sociodemographic variables,2–4 7 9 10 12–16 21 22
psychosocial factors,2 10 15 21–24 and health behaviours.2–4 7–9 15 16
This line of inquiry suggests that SRH is a multidimensional and
a holistic measure,5 25 even though its correlates have rarely
been examined in empirical analyses.

Understanding the relation between SRH and health or
mortality requires further investigation into the criteria
by which people judge their health. The aim of this paper is
to identify the determinants of SRH in two different cohorts,
in separate analyses for men and women. The com-
parative framework is aimed at assessing whether the
correlates of SRH are similar in different cultural contexts.
We use a range of variables, traditionally used as controls in
the examination of the SRH-mortality relation, to examine
the extent to which they predict SRH. Six categories of
variables are used: age, early life factors and measures of
family history, sociodemographic variables, psychosocial
factors, health behaviours, and measures of health and
disease.

METHODS
Study populations
Data for the analyses come from two European cohort
studies: the British Whitehall II study and the French Gazel
cohort study.

The Whitehall II study
The Whitehall
II study was established in 1985 as a
longitudinal study to examine the socioeconomic gradient
in health and disease among 10 308 civil servants (6895 men
and 3413 women).26 All civil servants aged 35–55 years in 20
London based departments were invited to participate by
letter, and 73% agreed. Baseline examination (phase 1) took
place during 1985–1988, and entailed a clinical examination
and a self administered questionnaire containing sections on
demographic characteristics, health, lifestyle factors, work
characteristics, social support, and life events. Clinical
examination included measures of blood pressure, anthro-
pometry, biochemical measurements, neuroendocrine func-
tion, and subclinical markers of cardiovascular disease.
Subsequent phases of data collection have alternated
between postal questionnaire alone and postal questionnaire
accompanied by a clinical examination. Since baseline six
phases of data collection have been completed, with the most
recent phase (phase 7) completed in 2004. The University
College London ethics committee approved the study.

The GAZEL cohort study
The GAZEL cohort was established in 1989, on employees of
France’s national gas and electricity company: Electricite´ de
France-Gaz de France (EDF-GDF). Further details of this
study can be found elsewhere.27 At baseline, 20 625 (15 011
men and 5614 women), aged 35–50, gave consent
to
participate in this study. The study design consists of an
annual questionnaire used to collect data on health, lifestyle,
individual, familial, social and occupational factors, and life
events. Various sources within EDF-GDF provide additional
data about Gazel participants. Occupational and personal
data are updated through human resources department files.

A six point scale assessing whether either parent suffered from angina, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and
diabetes; 0 = no disease and 5 = all five diseases.
A six point scale assessing any sibling suffered from angina, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes; 0 = no
disease and 5 = all five diseases.

View on whether there were things one could do to reduce chance of heart attack: 1 = definitely, 2 = might, 3 = little one can
do.
The 10 items of the Bradburn affect balance scale were presented as four point scales (0–3), summed up to a scale ranging
from 215 to +15; high scores reflect high positive affect.32
The Cook-Medley hostility scale, high scores reflect high hostility.41
Five item scale, scores range from 0–30; high scores indicate greater life satisfaction.42
High scores on the scale (0–6) reflect greater social isolation; assessing lack of people to share with, no relatives, friends or
work colleagues seen, and no social or religious belonging.
Network scale (0–28) assesses the frequency and the number of friends, relatives and work colleagues seen; and
participation in social and religious groups; high scores indicate bigger network.

close person, financial difficulty, divorce/separation, other marital/family problem, mugging/robbery, change of job/
residence.
Sum of four point scales (0–3) assessing the impact of the each life event (total 0–24); high scores reflect greater emotional
impact.

(or job control); high scores reflect greater control.39
A one item 4-point measure from the Karasek questionnaire asking respondents to judge how satisfied they were with their
job overall; high scores reflect greater dissatisfaction.39

Number of health problems out of a list of 13: bronchitis, arthritis, sciatica, persistent skin trouble, asthma, hay fever,
persistent stomach trouble, constipation, piles, persistent foot trouble, trouble with varicose veins, depression, persistent
trouble with gums or mouth. 0 = no problems and 13 = all of them.
Number of symptoms in the last 14 days: phlegm, diarrhoea, indigestion, shortness of breath, dizziness, earache, swollen
ankles, nervous/depressed, cold/flu, sore throat, sleep problems, pains in chest, backache, nausea/vomiting, tired, skin
trouble, toothache. 0 = no problems and 17 = all of them.

Weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres.
Composite indicator of three doctor diagnosed illnesses (diabetes, heart trouble, hypertension) and respiratory illness
measured by MRC chronic bronchitis questionnaire; 0 = no illness and 4 = all 4 illnesses.
Mental health was assessed using the general health questionnaire; 0 = good mental health and 90 = poor mental health.34

coronary heart diseases come from the company’s health
insurance department. Occupational physicians collect data
on working conditions and occupational exposures. Sources
outside EDF-GDF provide data on causes of death, health
care use, and admissions to hospital. Every five years,
volunteers are invited to visit a health centre run by the
national health insurance fund, where they undergo a full
standardised medical examination.

Self rated health
The Whitehall II measure of SRH asked respondents: ‘‘Over
the past 12 months would you say your health has been—
very good, good, average, poor or very poor’’. The Gazel
participants responded on an eight point scale, anchored by
1 = ’’very good’’ and 8 = ’’very bad’’,
to the following
question: ‘‘How would you judge the state of your general
health?’’

Measures
All the variables used in the analyses come from wave 1
(1985–89) of the Whitehall II study and wave 2 of the Gazel
study (1990) as the wave 1 data did not have several critical
variables. Earliest waves of the study have been used to
reduce bias related to loss of follow up.

Explanatory variables
Tables 1A and 1B show the explanatory variables, definitions,
and analysis categories for both studies. These variables have
been grouped into six theoretical categories: early life factors
and measures of family history, sociodemographic variables,
psychosocial factors, health behaviour, and measures of

health and disease; further details of these measures can be
found in table 1A for the Whitehall II and table 1B for Gazel.

Statistical analysis
Analysis was carried out separately, in men and women and
in the two cohorts. The first step consisted of examining
correlations to decide the variables that would be used to
predict SRH. All variables that were significantly correlated
with SRH at p,0.05 were then used as determinants of SRH.
We used multiple linear regressions to build models to predict
SRH.28 Linearity of association between the determinants and
SRH was ensured using the one way analysis of variance test
of linearity; further examination of residuals scatterplots
found no important deviations from the assumptions of
normality and linearity. In the first set of analyses, the
variables were entered in a hierarchical multiple regression;
the order of entry of variables (or a set of variables) here was
theoretically determined. We chose the order in an attempt to
reflect temporality over the life course; early life measures
were entered before later life measures, health behaviours

before health itself, and so on. The order of entry of variables
was as follows: age, early life factors and measures of family
history, sociodemographic variables, psychosocial
factors,
health behaviours, and measures of health and disease. F
tests were used to compute the significance of each set of
variables; the resulting change in r2 reflected the variance
explained in the outcome. The change in r2 was tested at
p,0.05 to check if it was significantly different from zero.

The next step involved stepwise method of multiple
regression to identify a small subset of determinants of
SRH. This analysis is appropriate here as the cases (number)
to determinants ratio is much larger than the recommended
50:1 ratio.29 The basic procedures involved are: identifying an
initial model with one determinant, one that is most highly
correlated with SRH; iteratively ‘‘stepping’’, that is repeatedly
changing the model at the previous step by adding or
removing determinants in accordance with the ‘‘stepping
criteria’’ defined; and terminating the search when stepping
is no longer possible given the stepping criteria. Given the
large number of cases in the analysis the stepping criteria was

set at p = 0.001 for entry and p = 0.01 at exit.30 Furthermore,
only variables that explained more than 1% of the variance
(r2.0.01) in SRH were retained as determinants. Stepwise
regression provides an objective method for selecting vari-
ables that maximise r2 with the smallest number of variables
used. As a large number of determinants were used,
multicollinearity statistics were analysed throughout using
tolerance statistics, set here at 0.50. All analyses were carried
out using SPSS 11.5.1 (SPSS for Windows, rel 11.0.1,
Chicago, SPSS, 2001).

RESULTS
SRH data were available on 6889 men and 3403 women
(10 292 overall; 99.85% of total number at baseline) in the
Whitehall II study and 13 008 men and 4688 women in the
Gazel study (17 696 overall; 88.85% of total number at
baseline). Because of missing values, our analyses, at best,
include 7043 (68.43% of those with SRH data) people in
Whitehall II and 17 438 (98.54% of those with SRH data) in
the Gazel study. Lower numbers in the Whitehall II data are
related to four different versions of a questionnaire being used
at phase 1 of the study; the first 2913 participants answered
versions 1–3 of the questionnaire that did not have several key
variables used here (for example, longstanding illness). Thus,
many of the bivariate analyses are based on smaller numbers.
The key variable associated with missing data in both cohorts

is employment grade, with data more likely to be missing
among people occupying low employment grade.

Tables 2A and 2B present bivariate analyses, correlation
coefficients here, to show the association between SRH and
its correlates in the Whitehall
II and the Gazel data,
respectively. The correlations were deemed to be significant
if p,0.05. Table 2A (Whitehall II results) shows that in men
four (age, father’s social class,
job demand, and alcohol
consumption) of the 35 determinants considered and two
among women (father’s social class and number of medicines
used in the past 14 days) did not have a significant
association with SRH. These variables were dropped in
subsequent analyses. Symptom score, sickness absence, and
the number of recurring health problems were the three
variables most strongly associated with SRH in the Whitehall
II data (table 2A).

Table 2B presents the correlations between 33 determi-
nants and SRH in the Gazel data. Three of these variables in
men (height, father’s social class, support received during life
events) and nine in women (height, father’s social class,
myocardial infarction in parents, cancer in parents, cancer in
siblings, smoking, alcohol consumption, frequency of eating

made a significant contribution to the prediction of SRH. The
largest improvement in r2, in both men and women, was
from model 5 to 6, reflecting the importance of health
variables in predicting SRH. All the variables considered
together explained 36.1 % of the variance in SRH in men and
36.9% in women.

The lower half of table 3 shows results for the Gazel data.
All the blocks considered for analyses (none of the measures
of early life factors and family history were considered for
further analyses in women) predicted SRH significantly. The
largest improvement in r2 in men was from model 5 to 6
(r2 = 0.221), followed by model 3 to 4 (r2 = 0.171). Among
women, the largest improvement was from model 3 to 4
(r2 = 0.231), followed by model 5 to 6 (r2 = 0.191). Thus
measures of health and psychosocial factors were major
determinants of SRH in the Gazel data. Overall, the variables
considered explained 42.7% of the variance in SRH in men
and 44.3% in women.

Table 4A presents the results from stepwise regression in
the Whitehall II data. Five variables explained a total of 33%
of the variance in SRH in men and 35% in women. Symptom

score in men and GHQ in women. Affect balance score33 is a
measure of psychological wellbeing whereas GHQ34 measures
minor psychiatric morbidity. These two measures are highly
correlated in men (r = 20.62, p,0.0001) and women
(r = 20.65, p,0.0001) in the Whitehall II study. In analyses
of men and women together (table 4A), it is the GHQ that
comes out a correlate, the other four remain the same.
Longstanding illness and the number of recurring health
problems were the other two predictors, explaining about 4%
and 1.2 % of the variance respectively.

Table 4B presents the results from a similar stepwise
regression in the Gazel data. In men, five variables met the
stepping criteria and explained 41.5% of the variance in SRH.
Feeling ‘‘physically tired’’ explained most of the variance in
SRH in men (32.1%) and women (34.6%). One of the
determinants in men is a non-health measure: work
satisfaction, explaining 1% of the variance in SRH. Among
women four determinants (physical tiredness, number of
health problems in the past year, emotional
reactions
(NHP),31 physical mobility (NHP)31 explained 43.9% of the
variance in SRH. In analyses of men and women together
four measures of health (physical tiredness, number of health
problems in the past year, physical mobility (NHP),31 number
of prescription drugs) explained 41.4% of the variance in
SRH.

The solution from the stepwise regression (tables 4A and
4B) was checked with other forms of statistical regression
(forward selection and backward deletion) and no differ-
ences were found. There were no problems of collinearity in
the final stepwise models, all tolereance levels were over 0.50.

DISCUSSION
SRH has two key features: it is subjective and evaluative.
However, little is known about its determinants. The purpose
of these analyses was to identify its determinants, using
multivariate regression analyses, in two prospective cohort
studies. Six categories of determinants were considered: age,
early life factors and family history, sociodemographic
variables, psychosocial factors, health behaviour, and health.
These blocks explained 36.1% of the variance in men (with 31
determinants) in the Whitehall II data and 36.9% in women
(with 33 determinants). In the Gazel data the variance
explained was 42.7% in men (with 30 determinants) and
44.3% in women (with 24 determinants). A search for a
smaller set of correlates using stepwise regression found five
determinants overall in the Whitehall II data and four in the
Gazel data explaining 34.7% and 41.4% of the variance in the
two studies, respectively. In both studies, it is essentially
measures of health that were independent determinants of
SRH.

Before further discussion of the results, the similarities and
differences in the two cohorts need to be highlighted. Besides
cultural differences between the two, there are also other
differences. Although they are both occupation based
cohorts, the work content of the employees is quite different.
The Whitehall II study is based on employees of the British
civil service, all of whom have office based jobs. The Gazel
study is based on the employees of the gas and electricity
public utilities in France (EDF-GDF), with many manual
workers, both skilled and unskilled. At baseline (1989),
14.8% of male and 29.1% of female Gazel participants were
classified as being ‘‘unskilled’’ workers by their employer in a
three level classification: unskilled workers, skilled workers,
and managers.27 The essential similarity between the two
cohorts is that participants in both studies had comparatively
stable employment. Earlier comparative work shows similar
social gradients in sickness absence and SRH in the two
cohorts.34

An explicit examination of the determinants of SRH is
important as it provides an insight into the interpretation of
this concept. The main question relates to whether people use
conventional indicators of health or if other elements like
family history, psychosocial
factors, and socioeconomic
position influence the assessment of SRH. In other words,
to what extent is the perception of one’s health status
determined by traditional measures of health and to what
extent is it determined by other factors, which may be
correlated with SRH at the bivariate level. Our results show
that the statistically significant correlations at the bivariate
level (tables 2A and 2B) do not translate to independent
associations in multivariate analyses. The salient if unsur-
prising finding of this study is that SRH is mostly a measure
of health; measures of early life factors, family history,
sociodemograhics, and health behaviours make only minor
contributions to SRH whereas measures of health and in
Gazel also psychosocial factors are important correlates of
SRH. It has been suggested that SRH is a multidimensional
phenomenon5 25; our results show that it is mostly dimen-
sions of health that are independent determinants of SRH.

Results from the stepwise regression (men and women
combined) in the Whitehall II data (table 4A) show that SRH
is predicted by measures of current health status (symptom
score), health over the past year (sickness absence and
recurring health problems over the year), longer term health
problems (longstanding illness), along with measure of
minor psychiatric morbidity (GHQ). Sex differences in the
determinants of SRH in Whitehall II are minor; in men it is
the affect balance score that is a correlate rather than the
GHQ. Sex differences in the Gazel data are more pronounced.
The nature of the psychosocial determinant differs by sex, it
is ‘‘satisfaction with work’’ among men and ‘‘emotional
reactions’’ among women.

The striking aspect of the Gazel results is the importance of
the measure ‘‘physically tired’’ in predicting SRH; it explains
about 81.2% of the total variance explained (33.6% of 41.4%)
by the full model. This result can be explained in two ways.
Firstly, it reflects the essential difference between the two
cohorts, the results from the Gazel participants reflecting the
fact that their work is more physically demanding. This
interpretation is supported by results (not shown but
available from the authors) of a stepwise regression that
excluded the ‘‘physical tiredness’’ variable, which resulted in
the variable ‘‘work physically tiring’’ (table 1B) becoming an
independent determinant of SRH. The second interpretation
is that
is a good
comprehensive measure of health, as reflected in the strong
correlation with SRH.

In both studies only part the variance was explained by the
determinants examined, 34.7% in Whitehall II and 41.4% in
the Gazel data. In the Whitehall II data we examined (results
not shown) whether other physiological measures (choles-
terol, blood pressure) added to the prediction equation and
found it not to be the case. However, previous analysis on
Gazel data has shown SRH to be linked to diseases,
in
both cross sectional and longitudinal analysis.35 One could

Policy implications

Self rated health is a widely used measure of health status,
mainly used because of its simplicity and its strong relation
with outcomes like mortality. Self rated health is believed to
be a multidimensional phenomenon even though the
determinants of self rated health have rarely been investi-
gated in empirical analysis. Our analysis shows that
this
simple measure is in effect a valid measure of health.

speculate about the unexplained variance, traditionally seen
to be made up of determinants not included in the regression
equation, measurement error and individual differences. It is
probable that individual history of past health and expected
or aspired future health may be potential determinants of
SRH.

Comparison with other studies
SRH is a widely used measure in epidemiological studies; a
search on Medline (combination self rated health OR self
assessed health OR self reported health OR self perceived
health AND 2002 as year of publication) found 1991 papers.36
However, an explicit quantitative analysis of the independent
determinants of SRH remains elusive in the research
literature. An exception is a study by Jylha¨ and colleagues
that examined the correlational structure of SRH in an Italian
and Finnish sample.19 This study used logistic regression to
examine the relation between good (very good and fairly
good) and poor (average, fairly poor, and poor) health using a
smaller range of determinants (number of diseases, func-
tional ability, number of symptoms, problems with vision and
hearing, number of medical drugs being used, and educa-
tion). All determinants were significantly related to SRH in
multivariate analyses,
ratios associated with
‘‘functional ability’’ and ‘‘number of symptoms’’ were the
highest. We were able to extend the analyses by including a
wider range of correlates and quantifying the unique variance
in SRH explained by the correlates.

Study strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate
explicitly the determinants of SRH by quantifying the
amount of variance in SRH explained by independent
determinants. Data come from two large European cohorts,
providing sufficient numbers in each cohort
to permit
‘‘stepwise regression’’ without the risk of ‘‘overfitting’’.29 30
We were able to make an objective assessment of the
predictive power of several variables. Several categories of
determinants were examined in this study. There is evidence
to suggest that SRH forms a continuum from poor through
average to good health,37 38
linear
regression models and further permitting comparability of a
five point and an eight point measure of SRH. Furthermore, it
has been shown that different ways of treating the SRH
variable (dichotomous, ordinal, etc) yields similar results.39 A
number of limitations should also be noted. Firstly, data here
are from employees with stable jobs and cannot be assumed
to represent general populations. However, similarity of
results in the two contexts provides support
the
generalisability of our findings, at least to people in this age
group. A recent study examined the 59 year longitudinal
trajectory of SRH and concluded that it was comparatively
stable until age 5040; the predictors of SRH beyond this age
might be different. Secondly, our analyses are exploratory in
nature; further work with other measures of health is
required to delineate the determinants of SRH and possible
sex differences. Furthermore, the determinants in the two
studies are not strictly comparable; this is rarely possible
when international comparisons are being made. Rather than
restrict analyses to measures where some degree of equiva-
lence could be established, we chose to use multiple measures
from the two studies to permit an assessment of the principal
determinants of SRH. Finally, data are not missing at
random; the non-response is higher among persons who
are socially disadvantaged and likely to be in poorer health.
This is likely to lead to some underestimation of
the
association between SRH and its determinants.

for

In conclusion, our results show the determinants of SRH
to be measures of physical and mental health. The

‘‘multidimensional’’ nature attributed to SRH mainly trans-
lates to it being a holistic measure of health rather than a
measure of non-health circumstances as well.
