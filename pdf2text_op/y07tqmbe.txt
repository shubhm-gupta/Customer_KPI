Economic Consequences of
Customer Satisfaction

ABSTRACT The relationship between customer satisfaction and economic returns has received
growing attention in the customer satisfaction literature. However, there has been limited work
linking customer satisfaction to customer proﬁtability. Speciﬁcally, most empirical studies
conduct ﬁrm-wide or business-level tests, but few investigate if individual customers’ satisfaction
with products or services drives their purchase intentions and economic contributions to the ﬁrm.
Using panel data from 36 retail branch banks managed by an international ﬁnancial institution
(RBANK), which consists of two customer satisfaction data-points over nine months and monthly-
activity based customer proﬁtability data,
this study examines how individual customers’
satisfaction impacts customer revenue, customer costs, and customer proﬁtability. The results
indicate that several dimensions of customer satisfaction are positively associated with individual
customers’ repurchase intentions and ﬁrm reputation. The effect of the responsiveness dimension
dominates the effect of other dimensions in most tests. At RBANK, individual-level customer
revenue and costs both increase as customer satisfaction improves, but no signiﬁcant relation
exists between customer satisfaction and customer proﬁtability. These ﬁndings shed light on

Introduction

In response to an increasingly competitive marketplace, a growing number of organiz-
ations are actively using customer satisfaction measures in developing, monitoring, and
evaluating product and service offerings (Anderson et al., 1994). More and more research

attention is also being devoted to factors contributing to desirable customer outcome (Liao
& Chuang, 2004). It is widely believed that higher customer satisfaction leads to superior
economic returns.

To date, however, the empirical evidence is still mixed, although how customer satis-
faction measures relate to ﬁnancial performance has been examined in some studies
(e.g. Anderson et al., 1994; Ittner & Larcker, 1998a; Banker et al., 2000; Riley et al.,
2003). Most of those studies used traditional accounting performance for a speciﬁc aggre-
gated unit, such as ﬁrm-wide operating proﬁts or business-level returns on assets to
measure ﬁnancial performance. Thus, the general belief that higher economic returns
come from more satisﬁed customers still remains unproved.

Using panel data from 36 retail branch banks managed by an international ﬁnancial
institution, which consists of two customer satisfaction data-points over nine months
and monthly-activity based proﬁt data, this study empirically examines two research ques-
tions. (1) How will customer satisfaction affect existing customers’ purchase behavior? (2)
Does higher customer satisfaction lead to higher customer revenue, costs, and proﬁtabil-
ity? The evidence indicates that several dimensions of customer satisfaction are positively
associated with individual customers’ repurchase intentions and ﬁrm reputation. The
effect of the responsiveness dimension dominates the effect of other dimensions in most
tests. Individual customer revenue and costs both increase as customer satisfaction
improves. Surprisingly, no signiﬁcant relation exists between customer satisfaction and
customer proﬁtability.

Findings from this study shed light on several management areas. The ﬁrst is customer
relationship management. Understanding how each dimension of customer satisfaction
relates to repurchase intentions, customer revenue, costs, and proﬁts can assist managers
in ﬁnding out those attributes most valued by customers and thus gives them guidance in
delivering customer value to existing customers. The second is market segmentation.
Cross-analyzing customers along two dimensions, i.e. customer satisfaction and proﬁtabil-
ity, helps managers segment the market and further target customers. The third manage-
ment area is a balanced scorecard. While implementing a balanced scorecard, managers
have to translate missions and strategy into measurable objectives (Kaplan & Norton,
1997). The ﬁnding on the link between customer satisfaction measures and future
economic returns is beneﬁcial for managers to select lead indicators in the customer
perspective of a balanced scorecard.

The reminder of this study is organized as follows: related literature is reviewed in the
next section. Research site and data collection are described in the third section. Esti-
mation models and tests are developed in the fourth section. The results are presented
in the ﬁfth section. Conclusions are summarized in the sixth section.

Literature Review

The beneﬁts of customer satisfaction are well recognized both in practice and in the mar-
keting literature. In the academics, consistently providing high customer satisfaction is
well acknowledged to be associated with higher customer loyalty and enhanced reputation
(Fornell, 1992; Anderson & Sullivan, 1993; Wangnheim & Bayon, 2004). An enhanced
reputation can further aid in introducing new products by providing instant awareness
and the lowers costs of attracting new customers (Robertson & Gatignon, 1986;
Schmalansee, 1978). Customer loyalty can lead to increased purchase intentions, helps

to secure future revenues (Fornell, 1992; Rust & Zahorik, 1993; Rust & Keiningham,
1994), reduces the costs of future transactions (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990), decreases
price elasticity (Anderson, 1996), and minimizes the likelihood that customers will
defect (Anderson & Sullivan, 1993). With the above fundamental belief, ﬁrms strive for
higher customer satisfaction. Among 203 ﬁrms surveyed in 1996 on the uses, quality,
and perceived importance of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance measures, 85% of
them highly valued customer satisfaction information and 37% link customer satisfaction
measures to compensation (Ittner & Larcker, 1998b).

Improving customer satisfaction is not costless. In economics, customer satisfaction is
deﬁned as the function of product and service attributes. Offering more attributes desired
by customers usually increases costs. Anderson et al. (1997) further divided quality into
customization quality and standardization quality, demonstrating that customer satisfac-
tion should trade off with productivity, while it is more dependent on customization
quality. Costs of resources may be spent on activities not valued by customers. In addition,
a time lag between when customer investments are done and when revenues are realized
may hinder the relation between customer satisfaction and ﬁnancial performance (Foster
& Gupta, 1997).

To examine the causal relation between customer satisfaction and economic returns,
several studies have adopted ﬁrm level and business unit level tests. Anderson et al.
(1994) investigated how customer satisfaction is associated with ﬁnancial returns using
a national customer satisfaction index and a traditional accounting measure, ROI
(return on investment), and found that ﬁrm-wide ROI is positively affected by customer
satisfaction, but not immediately realized. However, Anderson et al. (1997) saw that
the relation is less signiﬁcant or even negative in service ﬁrms. Using a quarterly
branch-level customer satisfaction index and four accounting performance variables
from 73 retail branch banks, Ittner & Larcker (1998a) demonstrated that the increase in
many measures of branch-level ﬁnancial performances come indirectly through growth
in new customers, not directly through increased proﬁts from existing customers.

Banker et al. (2000) used operating proﬁts per available room to measure ﬁnancial per-
formance and veriﬁed its lead-lag relation with customer satisfaction (proxy by likelihood
of customer return and customer complaints) for 18 hotels managed by one hotel corpor-
ation. They also used Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the lag length
and found that six months are appropriate. Westlund & Lothgren (2001) examined the
interactions between quality, productivity, and economic performance in Swedish phar-
macies and showed that improving customer satisfaction leads to an increase in pro-
ductivity and cost efﬁciency. Using ﬁrm-level customer complaints and stock returns,
Riley et al. (2003) found that customer dissatisfaction is negatively associated with
stock returns. Matzler et al. (2005) analyzed 9-year data of the American Customer
Satisfaction Index and Tobin’s Q from 99 companies and suggest that there is a positive
relationship between ﬁrm-level customer satisfaction and shareholder value.

Although the overall impact of customer satisfaction on ﬁnancial performance is partly
revealed from these studies, we cannot see if individual customers’ purchase behaviors are
driven by their satisfaction with services and/or products. Firm-wide or business-level
analysis is not helpful for us to manage the relationship with individual customers
either. However, until now, few studies have examined the link between a customer-
level evaluation of a ﬁrm’s product or service offerings and customer-level proﬁtability.
Foster & Gupta (1997) represented the ﬁrst examination of the relationship. They

developed an activity-based model to evaluate customer proﬁtability and collected satis-
faction data from a wholesale beverage distributor company to examine the cross-section
relation between customer satisfaction and customer proﬁtability. Using customer-level
data from a telecommunications ﬁrm, Ittner & Larcker (1998a) discovered that future
retention and revenues are positively associated with customer satisfaction, but they did
not examine the impact of customer satisfaction on costs and proﬁts.

To complement the above studies, this study not only examines the cross-sectional
relation between customer satisfaction and individual customers’ purchase behavior as
well as contemporaneous economic contributions, but also investigates how customer sat-
isfaction affects future customer revenue, costs, and proﬁts. Furthermore, this study col-
lects data from 36 retail branch banks managed by an international ﬁnancial institution.
Compared with the beverage distributor company in Foster & Gupta (1997), the retail
banks examined in this study are relatively more dependent on customization quality. In
addition, both Foster & Gupta (1997) and Ittner & Larcker (1998a) investigated business
customers, while this study focuses on consumers. Incremental evidence is provided on the
link between individual-level customer satisfaction and economic contributions.

Research Site and Data Collection

Research Site

The research site for this study is an international ﬁnancial institution (hereafter referred to
as RBANK) having several lines of businesses such as credit cards, foreign exchange,
savings, and loans. RBANK has a long history and high reputation in the market. It had
36 domestic retail branch banks and 10 branch banks abroad during the period of this
study. The focus of this study is on those customers having savings accounts in branches
located within Taiwan.

RBANK has implemented activity-based costing since 1996. The management consult-
ant has been entrusted with the responsibility for directing an Activity-Based Costing
(ABC) team to construct the system since then. Until the present, monthly customer
revenue, costs and proﬁts are provided periodically to managers for decision-making.

More and more private banks have been established in Taiwan since 1991, because of
deregulation. The high level of competition in the banking industry has made it so that cus-
tomer satisfaction cannot be overemphasized in Taiwan. Ever since 1996, RBANK has
hired an international consulting ﬁrm to be responsible for periodical customer surveys
and analysis every half year. In order to motivate better service quality, those customer
satisfaction measures are also used to evaluate the performance of each bank branch
and its employees.

The researcher began to participate in designing the periodical customer survey in 1998.
Data used in this study are from two surveys implemented in the beginning and the middle
of 1998 respectively (hereafter referred to as the ﬁrst survey and the second survey).
Although we would like to analyze earlier customer satisfaction data as well, we cannot
do so, because of data unavailability. During the period of this study, the author worked
with the management in RBANK to jointly develop the survey while the marketing con-
sulting ﬁrm interviewed customers and collected data. For observing the dynamic change
in customer satisfaction, consistency of the survey and subjects is maintained. The same
survey was used in the second survey and the same customers were interviewed.

Data Collection

Monthly sales, expenses, and proﬁt data are obtained for a period of up to 9 months (begin-
ning with January 1998) for the 891 customers from 36 branches. Originally, 900 custo-
mers interviewed both in the ﬁrst survey and in the second survey were included in the
sample, but some were excluded due to data incompleteness. Hence, the ﬁnal sample
includes only 891 customers. The ﬁnancial data for individual customers are provided
from the department responsible for the Activity-Based Costing system. Other data on cus-
tomers’ characteristics are directly retrieved from the customer database of RBANK.
Company documents and interviews with senior managers and corporate staff provides
qualitative data on the implementation of the Activity-Based Costing and savings business.

Variable Measurement

Customer Satisfaction Measures

At least two different conceptualizations of customer satisfaction can be distinguished:
transaction-speciﬁc and cumulative (Boulding et al., 1993). The cumulative perspective
is used in this study, because we want to examine how customers’ aggregate consumption
experiences with services impact their proﬁt contributions to the ﬁrm over time.

Kaplan & Norton (1997) indicated that the three important performance drivers of custo-
mer satisfaction are price, time, and quality. Using the original SERVQUAL scales designed
by Parasuraman et al. (1988) as a guide to measure service quality and after making necess-
ary revisions, we group 26 – 33 questions to form multiple measures for the six dimensions of
customer satisfaction. They are price, speed, reliability, responsiveness, empathy, and tan-
gibles. A seven-point scale (from the most satisﬁed to the most dissatisﬁed) is used in the
design of the survey. The customer satisfaction survey was pre-tested. Ratings on those
questions corresponding to the same dimension are averaged. The six average ratings are
then obtained to measure each dimension of customer satisfaction.

Repurchase Intentions and Reputation Measures

Two questions relating to customers’ willingness to have an ongoing relation with
RBANK are used to measure customers’ repurchase intentions. As for reputation, one
question about how likely is it that customers will recommend the services of RBANK
to others is designed.

Customer Proﬁtability Measure

According to Kaplan & Cooper (1998), an activity-based costing system allows companies
to measure individual and aggregate customer proﬁtability. Customer revenue, costs, and
proﬁt data used in this study are all provided by RBANK’s internal cost accounting
system. They are all outputs of an activity-based cost system. The computation of custo-
mer proﬁtability in the system is described as follows.

Monthly transaction data are downloaded from RBANK’s mainframe. Interest reven-
ues and interest costs are then directly traced to each account. No matter if the trans-
actions are traded in front of the counters or through automated teller machines
(ATM), activity costs are accrued to each account based on each savings account’s con-
sumption of activity drivers. There are more than 30 activities provided, such as cash


560

deposit, cash withdrawal, and account opening. After deducting each account’s interest
costs and activity costs from interest revenues, each account’s proﬁtability is produced.
Finally, customer proﬁtability is determined by summing all of the individual customer-
related accounts’ proﬁtability.

In this study, activity cost and customer proﬁt data from the activity-based costing
system are used to estimate the relation between customer satisfaction and customer
costs and proﬁts. The average account balance, not interest revenue, is used to evaluate
the relation between customer satisfaction and customer revenue, because we want to
investigate the direct effect of customer satisfaction on customers’ changes in their pur-
chases. Thus, this removes the effect of a varying yield rate in different kinds of
savings businesses. The variables of this study are shown in Table 1.

Control Variables

Individual customer’s preferences and purchase powers vary. Dummy variables for demo-
graphic variables, such as sex and education degree, are used to capture individual effects
on ﬁnancial performance.

ﬁnancial performance. (The area surrounded by dotted lines is beyond the scope of this research.
It is shown to present the overall conceptual framework and to highlight the differences between

this study and prior related studies.)

Model (1) speciﬁes total customer satisfaction as a function of the six customer satisfac-
tion measures. Demographic dummies are also included to control for the impact of the
individual effect on customer satisfaction measures. Because the customers in our
sample are from 36 different branches, the varying differences between those branches
in location, service, size, and functions may impact those relations we want to investi-
gate. Thus, mT
m, the random disturbances characterizing branch m, is used to capture the
impact of those factors speciﬁc to each branch (Greene, 1997). Actually, the ﬁxed effect
model is another approach in controlling for group effects, which is an appropriate
model speciﬁcation only when we are conﬁdent that the differences between units can
be viewed as parametric shifts of the regression function. According to Greene
(1997), the Hausman test is used in this study to test which model ﬁts the data better.

The Impact of Customer Satisfaction on Customer Revenue

The ﬁrst test of the second research question concerns how customer satisfaction measures
affect current customer revenue and future customer revenue. We model the relation as
equation (4). Since the formation of customer satisfaction is a dynamic process, Bolton
& Drew (1991) examined the impact of service changes on customer attitudes using longi-
tudinal data and found that current attitudes are inﬂuenced by prior attitudes. We regress
current customer revenue, one-period ahead customer revenue, and two-period ahead cus-
tomer revenue on six dimensions of current customer satisfaction (in the second survey)
while controlling for the impact of past customer satisfaction measures (in the ﬁrst
survey).

The Impact of Customer Satisfaction on Customer Costs

We test the relation between customer satisfaction and customer costs in this subsection
to investigate further the second research question. Anderson et al. (1997) showed that
the association between changes in customer satisfaction and changes in productivity is
positive for goods, but negative for services. Using our data in the service sector, we
would like to gain further implications about whether higher satisfaction leads to higher
costs. The speciﬁcation is as follows:

The Impact of Customer Satisfaction on Customer Proﬁtability

For the ﬁnal test of the second research question, model (6) is speciﬁed. The relation
between customer satisfaction and proﬁtability is estimated by regressing current cus-
tomer proﬁts, one-period ahead customer proﬁts, and two-period ahead customer
proﬁts on six dimensions of current customer satisfaction (in the second survey)
while controlling for the impact of past customer satisfaction measures (in the ﬁrst
survey) in model (6).

Empirical Results

Descriptive Statistics

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all 891 customers. On average, the ratings in six
customer satisfaction dimensions fall within the range of four to six points, indicating
acceptable to very satisﬁed degrees. The standard deviations of the ratings in those dimen-
sions are mostly smaller than one, which shows a small rating variation.

Table 3 presents the correlation matrix. Total customer satisfaction is 1% signiﬁcantly
positively associated with each satisfaction dimension and the responsiveness (RES )
dimension has the highest correlation (r ¼ 0.69) coefﬁcient. All of the six customer satis-
faction measures are positively correlated with customers’ willingness to have an ongoing
relation with RBANK and customers’ willingness to recommend services to others, which
is consistent with our hypothesized relation between customer satisfaction measures and
repurchase intentions as well as ﬁrm reputation. As for the correlation between satisfaction
measures and customer revenue and costs, most dimensions of customer satisfaction are

positively correlated with revenues and costs, except for the price dimension. However, no
signiﬁcant and consistent relation exists between customer satisfaction measures and cus-
tomer proﬁts. Given that, all correlations are based on pooled data and should not provide
direct persuasive evidence for the tests in this study.

Relation between Customer Satisfaction and Repurchase Intentions

Table 4 shows that overall customer satisfaction depends more on the responsiveness
dimension while reliability and the price dimension have the least impact on overall evalu-
ation. Table 4 presents GLS estimates of the relation between customer satisfaction and
customers’ repurchase intentions. Customer satisfaction dimensions, responsiveness
(RES ) and tangible (TAN ), are both 1% signiﬁcantly positively associated with customers’
willingness for an ongoing business relationship. The result supports that customer satis-
faction positively impacts customers’ repurchase intentions. This is consistent with the
hypothesized relation.

Relation between Customer Satisfaction and Reputation

As shown in Table 4, responsiveness (RES ), tangible (TAN ), and empathy dimension
(EMP) all signiﬁcantly and positively impact customers’ likelihood of recommending
the services to others and the responsiveness (RES ) dimension has the greatest impact.
Hence, the hypothesis that customer satisfaction has a positive effect on reputation is
strongly supported.

Relation between Customer Satisfaction and Financial Performance

From Table 5, we ﬁnd that the impact of current customer satisfaction on current rev-
enues, one-period ahead revenues, and two-period ahead revenues is signiﬁcantly

positive in the responsiveness dimension (RES ) after controlling for the effect of past
customer satisfaction measures. This ﬁnding supports the fact that improving customer
satisfaction has a positive effect on customer revenue. As for the cost side, a signiﬁcant
positive relation exists between the speed dimension (SPE), current customer costs,
one-period ahead customer costs, and two-period ahead customer costs after controlling
for the past customer satisfaction measures. However,
the impact of the empathy
dimension (EMP) is negative. It is shown that different economic impacts have been
realized along different dimensions of customer satisfaction. However, from Table 6
there is no signiﬁcant relation between current customer satisfaction and proﬁts, one-
period-ahead proﬁts, and two-period-ahead proﬁts after controlling for the lagged
customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the responsiveness dimension of customer satisfac-
tion explained most variances in repurchase intentions and customer revenue. This
implies that multi-dimensional customer satisfaction measures are necessary for
managers to investigate what customers value most. Single customer satisfaction
offers limited implications.

Conclusions

Given the belief of practitioners on customer satisfaction and its importance for customer
management decisions, some studies have empirically examined its relation with ﬁnancial
performance and provided mixed evidence. However, most of these studies conduct ﬁrm-
wide or business-level tests while few have investigated customer-level economic conse-
quences. Although all three tests belong to the test of the ﬁnancial outcome of customer
satisfaction, the implications behind them are quite different.

This study examines how individual customers’ satisfaction with services impacts their
purchases and proﬁt contributions to the ﬁrm. From our empirical results, customer satis-
faction is found to be positively associated with customers’ repurchase intentions and the
ﬁrms’ reputation. The impact of overall customer satisfaction is largely attributable to the
impact of the responsiveness dimension. While there is no signiﬁcant and positive relation
between customer satisfaction and customer proﬁtability, customer satisfaction does have
a positive impact on customer revenue and costs. This ﬁnding reveals that higher customer
satisfaction leads to higher customer revenue and higher customer costs at the same time,
and thus customer proﬁts remain unaffected.

From the interviews with customers, we have found that customers feel safe depositing
their money into RBANK and they believe interest rates are similar among different banks.
This implies that service quality plays a more important role affecting customers’ satisfac-
tion with RBANK. Looking back on the empirical results in this study, the effect of the
responsiveness dimension is found to dominate the effect of the other dimensions in
various tests. This dimension measures the front-end employees’ attitudes toward custo-
mers. Combining this evidence altogether, the responsiveness dimension is demonstrated
to be a key determinant of customer value and thus it signiﬁcantly affects customer’
purchases at RBANK.

In summary, our study makes two contributions to the literature. First, it provides evi-
dence on the outcome of customer satisfaction in consumer research. The impacts of cus-
tomer satisfaction on ﬁrm reputation and customers’ repurchase intentions are empirically
validated. Second, using data from an activity-based system, we have documented the
direct link between customer satisfaction and customer proﬁtability. The surprising ﬁnd-
ings provide a different insight for the claim that higher customer satisfaction always
comes with higher proﬁt contributions. Consistent with Anderson et al. (1997), a trade-
off between customer satisfaction and productivity does exist in the service sector. Prac-
tically, this study also highlights a way for managers to analyze customer value and its
relation with customers’ purchase behavior. This is beneﬁcial for long-term customer
relationship management.

There are a number of limitations to this study. First of all, the results are derived based
on data from a speciﬁc research site and thus may be generalized to other corporations
with caution. Second, the interaction between six dimensions of customer satisfaction is
not considered in this study. Taking those factors into account can offer a deeper under-
standing of customer value and its relation with customers’ purchase behavior. In addition,
future studies can extend to investigate more ﬁrms in the same industry or to examine ﬁrms
from different industries for a better comparison. Another extension is to use more data-
points over time to observe the longitudinal relation between the change in individual cus-
tomer satisfaction and future proﬁtability. A more challenging extension is to measure
individual customers’ lifelong economic contributions and to examine whether more sat-
isﬁed customers have higher lifetime values.
