Human Resource Management and
Corporate Performance in the UK
David E. Guest, Jonathan Michie, Neil Conway
and Maura Sheehan

Abstract

The relationship between HRM and performance was explored in 366 UK com-
panies using objective and subjective performance measures and cross-sectional
and longitudinal data. Using objective measures of performance, greater use of
HRM is associated with lower labour turnover and higher proﬁt per employee
but not higher productivity. After controlling for previous years’ performance,
the association ceases to be signiﬁcant. Using subjective performance estimates,
there is a strong association between HRM and both productivity and ﬁnancial
performance. The study therefore conﬁrms the association between HRM and
performance but fails to show that HRM causes higher performance.

1. Introduction

A major challenge for organizations in the future seems likely to be an ever
more urgent search for competitive advantage. It is increasingly argued that
the  organizations  best  able  to  meet  this  challenge  will  be  those  that  can
acquire and utilize valuable, scarce and inimitable resources (Barney 1995).
Human resources can fall into this category, it is argued, particularly if they
are effectively deployed through appropriate human resource practices and
the management of organizational culture (Barney and Wright 1998). One of
the key tasks for organizations will therefore be the effective management of
human resources. This presents a challenge, both for organizations and for
nations such as the UK, as ﬁrms seek to compete in world markets and search
for  increased  productivity  by  encouraging  the  spread  of high-performance
workplaces.

Additional challenges to the future management of people at work arise
from  the  growing  expectations  of an  increasingly  well-educated  workforce

that  demands  both  challenging  work  but  also  scope  for  an  acceptable
work–life balance. To attract and retain key workers, it  will be essential to
present  and  apply  the  kind  of human  resource  policies  and  practices  that
appeal to such workers. By implication, organizations may ﬁnd that they need
to ensure the involvement and commitment of workers as part of the route
to high performance.

The research reported in this paper explores the relation between human
resource management (HRM) and corporate performance in a cross-section
of UK ﬁrms. A feature of the study is a comparison of various objective and
subjective  outcome  measures. The  paper  starts  by  reviewing  the  relevant 
literature before describing the methods adopted and the core ﬁndings. The
results suggest that, while there appears to be an association between greater
use  of human  resource  practices  and  some  measures  of corporate  perfor-
mance, there is no convincing evidence that use of HR practices is associated
with a change in performance.

2. Review of the literature

There is a growing body of evidence showing an association between human
resource management and corporate performance (see e.g. Appelbaum et al.
2000; Arthur 1994; Batt 2002; Becker and Gerhart 1996; Becker and Huselid
1998; Guthrie 2001; Huselid 1995; Ichniowski et al. 1997; MacDufﬁe 1995).
Most  of the  published  research  supporting  this  association  is  American.
Despite an extensive UK literature on the nature of HRM — on its growth,
its link to strategy, its limitations, its biases and the extent and problems of
application  (see  e.g. Legge  1995; Sparrow  and  Marchington  1999; Storey
2001)  —  there  are  still  relatively  few  published  UK  company-level  studies
exploring the relation between HRM and organizational performance. Nev-
ertheless, if we look at research reports, the pattern of available evidence is
similar to the that of the USA in showing some association between HRM
and performance (see e.g. Conyon and Read 1999; Patterson et al. 1997; Peccei
et al. 2002; Thompson 1998; West 2002). However, each of these studies had
a relatively small, sometimes sector-speciﬁc, sample, and the need remains for
a comprehensive study that can determine whether the kind of ﬁndings appar-
ently consistently reported in the USA can be replicated in the UK.

The case for an association between HRM and performance is based on
two linked arguments. The ﬁrst, noted above, is that the effective deployment
of human resources offers one of the most powerful bases for competitive
advantage (Barney 1995). The second argument is that effective deployment
of human resources depends on the application of a distinctive combination
of practices, sometimes described as bundles of practices (MacDufﬁe 1995)
or as HRM systems (Becker and Huselid 1998). The nature of this distinc-
tive combination continues to be a matter of debate. Some of the research
has attempted to categorize HR practices in terms of a ‘high performance
work  system’ (e.g. Appelbaum  et  al. 2000), while  others  have  described  a
system of ‘high-commitment management’ (Arthur 1994; Pfeffer 1998; Wood

and de Menezes 1998) or ‘high-involvement management’ (Guthrie 2001). In
other words, once the general case for HRM has been made, there is a further
argument about the form of HRM that is likely to be most effective. However,
it is worth noting that positive results appear to be reported irrespective of
the deﬁnition, and therefore the precise combination of practices, utilized by
researchers.

Bundles  and  human  resource  systems  focus  on  ‘internal  ﬁt’ (Becker  and
Huselid 1998; Guest 1997; Venkatraman 1989), or the use of a consistent set
of HR practices. The utility of this emphasis has been challenged by those
who argue that performance is more likely to be enhanced by achieving ‘exter-
nal  ﬁt’, whereby  the  external  environment  will  help  to  shape  the  business
strategy, which in turn will determine the appropriate form of HRM (see e.g.
Wright  and  McMahan  1992). There  is  a  plausible  case  that  HRM  will  be
more effective if it ﬁts the business strategy of the ﬁrm. A key implication of
this focus on ‘external ﬁt’ is that a distinctive form of HRM, however it is
characterized, will  not  be  equally  effective  in  organizations  with  different
business strategies. Despite this, reviews of the evidence (Becker and Gerhart
1996; Becker  and  Huselid  1998)  acknowledge  that  from  the  American
research there appears to be stronger support for the role of internal rather
than external ﬁt, and in this paper the focus will be primarily on internal ﬁt.
One of the trends in the structure of employment in recent decades that
may continue in the future is the shift from manufacturing to services. If this
is the case, then it is important to show that the association between human
resource management and performance applies across both sectors. As Batt
(2002) notes, much of the earlier published work in the USA was conducted
in  the  manufacturing  sector  (see  e.g. Arthur  1994; Ichniowski  et  al. 1997;
MacDufﬁe 1995; Appelbaum et al. 2000; Youndt et al. 1996). This has been
only  partly  balanced  by  service-sector  studies  such  as  those  reported  by
Delery and Doty (1996) and more recently by Batt herself (2002), as well as
by cross-sector studies (Huselid 1995; Delaney and Huselid 1996; Becker and
Huselid  1998; and  Capelli  and  Neumark  2001). Despite  this  element  of
neglect, Hitt et al. (2001) argue that it is in some parts of the service sector,
such as professional service ﬁrms, that ‘intangible’ human resources might be
expected to play a key role, while research by Peccei and Rosenthal (2001)
highlights an association between human resource practices and positive cus-
tomer-oriented behaviour in stores. This reinforces the case for exploring the
role  of HRM  in  the  service  sector, where  the  great  majority  of people  are
employed, and for a systematic comparison of the two main sectors in the
UK using the same research methods.

In the literature on HRM and corporate performance, the concept of per-
formance has been addressed in a variety of ways. The most obvious measure
is some indicator of ﬁnancial performance, and measures used include return
on  investment  and  Tobin’s  Q  (ﬁrm  market  value/book  value: see  Huselid
1995). However, it can be argued that ﬁnancial performance lies at the distant
end  of the  causal  chain, and  that  outcome  measures  more  closely  linked 
to HRM might be more appropriate. This is reﬂected in some of the other

measures  that  have  been  reported  in  the  literature, ranging  from  labour
turnover to aspects of productivity such as scrap rates and sales per employee.
Ideally, we need to use a range of proximal and distal measures and examine
how the human resource system relates to each.

A further issue is the role and value of subjective and objective indicators
(Guthrie 2001). While there are clear attractions in objective measures, the
accountancy protocols on which ﬁnancial indicators are based have recently
come under critical scrutiny in the context of a number of corporate scan-
dals. Furthermore, managers are likely to act on the basis of their subjective
perceptions  of ﬁrm  performance, often  in  relation  to  the  performance  of
competitors, rather  than  solely  in  the  light  of objective  performance. In 
workplace-level studies the scope to use objective indicators, particularly in
relation to ﬁnancial outcomes, is severely limited. Research to date has used
both objective and subjective indicators, and a case can be made for both.
What we need to know therefore is whether the results are similar irrespective
of which measure is used.

A ﬁnal issue that needs to be addressed is the question of what the research
seeks to explain. Much of the published research has shown an association
between HRM and performance, either at the same point in time or over time.
This  demonstration  of an  association  is  an  important  step  in  advancing
research but leaves uncertainties about cause and effect. A second and rather
different question seeks more explicitly to determine whether HRM causes a
change in performance. Ideally, this requires measurement of both HRM and
performance over time and an opportunity to control for previous practices
and  performance. This  is  likely  to  be  highly  problematic  with  respect  to
HRM, whether considered at a strategic or an operational level. For example,
for  each  practice  we  may  need  to  take  account  not  only  of whether  it  is
applied, but of any change in form, coverage and frequency of use. It may
therefore be more realistic to focus on performance where measures over time
tend to be more consistent. However even this approach is not without its
problems, since, if we  do  not  know  when  HR  practices  (or  systems)  were
introduced or signiﬁcantly amended, we cannot determine whether they have
already had an effect which would be apparent in the test of association but
not in the test of change. The gains from HRM may already have accrued,
so no further change will be recorded. For this reason, there are beneﬁts in
exploring both the associational and the causal relationship while collecting
performance data over a period of time. This is the approach adopted in this
study, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.

Several points that emerge from this review shape the focus of the study
presented in this paper. The ﬁrst is that a large majority of published studies
ﬁnd an association between HR practices and ﬁrm performance, regardless
of whether  they  are  cross-sectional  or  longitudinal, whether  conducted  at
establishment or company level, whether based on strong performance data
or subjective estimates, whatever sector they are based on, whatever opera-
tional deﬁnition of HRM is used and wherever they are conducted. The study
by  Capelli  and  Neumark  (2001)  is  probably  the  most  notable  exception,

although in the UK Wood and de Menezes (1998) also failed to ﬁnd consist-
ent associations between HRM and performance. Despite the positive thrust
of most published empirical ﬁndings, Wood (1999) among others has noted
that  the  quality  of the  research  base  supporting  the  relationship  between
HRM and performance is relatively weak, even in the USA. Given the pos-
sibility that institutional and market constraints in Europe lead to different
outcomes (Pauuwe 1996), research exploring the association between HRM
and performance in countries like the UK is urgently needed. Furthermore,
although  research  has  been  conducted  in  both  manufacturing  and  service
sectors, the potentially key role of human resources in the service sector, and
the  importance  of the  larger  and  rather  more  disparate  service  sector  for
employment in the future, point to the need for further cross-sector research.
More generally, questions remain about the measurement of both HRM and
performance, and about the weight and relevance of tests of association and
causation. It is in this context, and recognizing the potential implications for
theory, research and national policy on productivity and related issues asso-
ciated with the future of work, that further research was undertaken in the
UK on the relationship between HRM and performance.

3. The research framework

The broad aims of the study were: to explore the relationship between the
use of human resource management and a range of performance measures
in a sample of UK organizations; to compare the results based on subjective
and objective indicators of performance; and to compare results obtained in
the manufacturing and service sectors. On this basis, we explore the follow-
ing hypotheses.
• Hypothesis  1a: There  will  be  an  association  between  greater  use  of HR
• Hypothesis  1b: There  will  be  an  association  between  greater  use  of
• Hypothesis  1c: There  will  be  an  association  between  greater  use  of HR

HR practices and higher labour productivity.

practices and lower labour turnover.

practices and higher proﬁtability.

We have noted that research to date has been based on both objective and
subjective indicators of performance, and that there is some evidence from
research by Guthrie (2001), based on a rather different kind of analysis by
Machin  and  Stewart  (1996), that  subjective  data  may  be  as  valid  as  more
objective measures. On this basis, we add a further hypothesis.
• Hypothesis 2: The direct relationship between HRM and performance out-
comes will be signiﬁcant when both objective and subjective measures of
performance are used.

We have noted that one of the aims of the research is to compare results for
manufacturing  and  service-sector  companies, bearing  in  mind  the  growing

importance  of the  service  sector  in  the  context  of the  future  of work.
However, since  there  is  no  basis  on  which  to  expect  systematic  differences
between the sectors, we offer no speciﬁc hypothesis about this comparison.

4. Research methods and data collection

The Research Strategy

Data were collected through structured questionnaires using telephone inter-
views. The decision to use telephone interviews was based on evidence from
previous UK research suggesting that senior directors were increasingly reluc-
tant  to  complete  written  questionnaires  and  that  a  low  response  rate  was
therefore likely. There is no evidence that telephone interviews result in dif-
ferent responses from face-to-face interviews. While it restricts the ﬂexibility
of the questions, since response categories have to be read out over the tele-
phone, it has the advantage over questionnaires of allowing for clariﬁcation
of responses and increasing the likelihood that the appropriate person will
answer the questions. The interviews with the head of HR, or the most senior
person  responsible  for  HR, covered  HR  practices; aspects  of HR  strategy
and questions concerning effectiveness of HR practices; employee responses;
and subjective assessments of performance. Independent data on employee
numbers, sales  and  ﬁnancial  performance  were  obtained  from  Dun  and 
Bradstreet.

The interviews were conducted in mid-1999 and were carried out on behalf
of the research team by TNS Ltd. Information on ﬁnancial performance was
collected  for  the  years  from  1996–97  to  2000–01. Much  of the  research
reported to date on HRM and performance has been based on cross-sectional
data. In this study we adopted two methods to ensure that the data were lon-
gitudinal. The ﬁrst was to analyse the information on HR practices in 1999
in relation to independent data on labour productivity and proﬁtability for
2000–01. By ensuring that the performance measures are collected after the
HR  measures, we  can  partially  address  the  potential  problem  of reverse
causality and present a convincing test of association. The second method
was to take account of prior performance by controlling for average perfor-
mance in the three previous years, using the average to limit the impact of
idiosyncratic single-year changes. This provides a test of whether HR prac-
tices are associated with any change in performance. The further attraction
of this approach is that it takes into account the possibility that prior ﬁnan-
cial performance may explain the adoption of HR practices. Set against this,
there is the risk, noted above, that companies that have already seen the ben-
eﬁts  of HR  practices  and  are  long-term  high  performers  may  not  improve
their performance any further over a year. This implies that we should con-
sider  both  methods  set  out  here, recognizing  that  the  analysis  of the  rela-
tionship  between  HR  practices  in  1999  and  performance  in  2000  seeks  to
explore the presence of an association between HRM and performance, while

the addition of controls for prior performance seeks to test for the impact of
HR practices on change in performance.

The Sample

The sample was drawn from the lists provided by Dun and Bradstreet of UK-
based companies employing more than 50 people. Interviews were completed
with  610  managers  responsible  for  HR  (hereafter  described  as  ‘HR  man-
agers’, although  not  all  were  HR  specialists). Despite  the  source  of the
sample, we were able to collect full ﬁnancial information from Dun and Brad-
street on only 366 of the 610 ﬁrms for which we have data on HR practices.1
The sample of 610 ﬁrms included 60 per cent in manufacturing and 40 per
cent in services according to the SIC classiﬁcation. This indicates that man-
ufacturing was heavily over-represented. Indeed, some service-sector organi-
zations, including  those  in  ﬁnancial  services, were  notably  less  enthusiastic
about  being  interviewed. Fifty  per  cent  of the  companies  had  a  workforce 
of between 50 and 200, 31 per cent between 201 and 1000, and 9 per cent
more than 1000. Only 52 per cent were HR specialists; the remainder, pre-
dominantly  in  smaller  organizations, had  someone  with  a  title  such  as
‘company  director’, ‘payroll  manager’ or  ‘general  manager  responsible  for
HR issues’. Fifty-one per cent of the respondents were women and 49 per
cent were men. Thirty-four per cent recognized a trade union, although 42
per  cent  of these  estimate  that  less  than  half the  workforce  belongs  to  a 
union. The 366 ﬁrms for which independent performance data were available
differed signiﬁcantly from the full sample of 610 in three respects: they were
likely (i) to be somewhat smaller, (ii) to be in manufacturing rather than ser-
vices and (iii) not to be multinationals.

The Measures

(a) Measures of HR Practices
Human resource management was measured through 48 items in the inter-
view schedule for HR managers. These are outlined in Box 1. The 48 items
were  drawn  from  the  existing  literature  (see  e.g. Becker  and  Gerhart  1996;
Dyer and Reeves 1995; Foulkes 1980; Guest and Hoque 1994; Huselid 1995;
Pfeffer 1994, 1998; Wood and Albanese 1995), rather than from a speciﬁc a
priori deﬁnition of HRM, although there was some emphasis on what have
been described as ‘high-commitment’ (Wood and De Menezes 1998) or high-
performance (Appelbaum et al. 2000) practices. They covered nine main areas
of HRM: recruitment  and  selection; training  and  development; appraisal;
ﬁnancial ﬂexibility; job design; two-way communication; employment secu-
rity  and  the  internal  labour  market; single  status  and  harmonization; and
quality. The items were a mix of estimates of the proportion of the work-
force that experienced a particular practice and some dichotomous variables
where proportions made no sense.

Human Resource Management and Performance

301

The process employed in arriving at this mean score was as follows. Most
models  underlying  HRM  suggest  that  HR  practices  should  be  widely  dis-
persed within the organization (for an exception see Wright and Snell 1998).
We  therefore  adopted  a  demanding  cut-off point  whereby  the  item  was
counted if it applied to 90 per cent or more of the workforce. Within each 
of the nine HR practices, the average number of speciﬁc items applying to
more than 90 per cent of the workforce was then counted. For dichotomous
items, the score was computed as a straight count of the number of items
that applied to the whole workforce. The scores within each of the nine HR
practices  approximated  to  a  normal  distribution. Scores  were  standardized
within the nine HR practices since the number of items describing each of
the practices varied.

Initial  factor  analysis  of these  nine  aggregate  HR  practices  revealed  no
coherent factors or what might be described as ‘bundles’ of practices. There-
fore, in line with the argument of Becker and Huselid (1998) about the need
to measure the overall human resource system, a measure was used based on
the combined mean scores across the nine practices.

(b) Measures of organizational performance
Various estimates of performance were obtained within the interviews. These
included  employment  relations  items  such  as  labour  turnover, absence  and
industrial  conﬂict. Estimates  of labour  productivity  and  ﬁnancial  perfor-
mance  were  also  obtained  using  a  format  similar  to  that  in  the  Workplace
Employee Relations Survey (Cully et al. 1999), whereby performance is com-
pared against the average for the industry on a ﬁve-point scale from ‘a lot
below average’ (1) through ‘about average’ (3) to ‘a lot better than average’
(5).2 Speciﬁc ﬁgures on labour turnover for the previous year were obtained.
These were coded as follows: 0–4.9 per cent (0); 5–14.9 per cent (1); 15–50
per cent (2); >50.1 per cent (3).

Independent  ﬁnancial  data  were  collected  from  Dun  and  Bradstreet.
Labour productivity was measured by the value of sales per employee, and
ﬁnancial performance was measured by the company’s proﬁt per employee.3
The  measure  of sales  per  employee  has  been  quite  extensively  used  as  an 
indicator of labour productivity. The use of proﬁt per employee to measure
proﬁtability reﬂects a desire to use a measure that is related in some way to
employees in the organization. Other potential measures such as Tobin’s Q
and return on investment were not readily calculated on the basis of the infor-
mation we were able to obtain from Dun and Bradstreet.

(c) Control variables
Information  was  collected  on  UK  company  workforce  size  from  Dun  and
Bradstreet. Sectors (services = 1, manufacturing = 0), trade union member-
ship  (membership  density  >25  per  cent  = 1, else  = 0), and  whether  the 
organization  was  part  of a  multinational  (yes  = 1, no  = 0)  were  identiﬁed 
from  interview  responses. Information  was  also  collected  on  aspects  of

employment relations, including the presence of a consultative committee, a
staff association and whether there was a single union deal (yes = 1, no = 0).
These were intended to provide some indication of employment relations for-
malization. Finally, information  was  collected  on  whether  the  respondent
held an HR post (yes = 1, no = 0), and the perceived importance of the overall
HR policy in terms of controlling labour costs (vital = 5, not very important
= 1), the latter of which serves as a crude proxy for a cost-based HR strat-
egy. These items were used as control variables.

of HR practices applied across the organizations in the full sample is rela-
tively low.4 (For full details, see Guest et al. 2000.)

Two  points  are  worth  noting  from  Table  1. With  respect  to  employment
relations, 24 per cent of ﬁrms have a union density of 25 per cent or more,
33 per cent have a consultative committee, and 13 per cent have a single union
deal. These variables tend not to be strongly associated with any of the out-
comes, except for a weak negative association with the measure of produc-
tivity, namely sales per employee. Second, there is a relatively low correlation
of 0.33 between the objective measure of proﬁt per employee between 1997
and 1999 and the subjective assessment of comparative proﬁt in 1999. Even
more starkly, the correlation between the objective measure of productivity
between  1997  and  1999, namely  sales  per  employee, and  the  comparative
assessment of productivity is only 0.06. It is tempting to suggest that these
results question the validity of the subjective assessments. However, it is pos-
sible that they are valid accounts of comparative performance and that we
are not comparing like with like.

The Association between HRM and ‘Objective’ Indicators of Performance

Hypothesis 1 proposed a relationship between greater use of HR and lower
labour turnover, higher labour productivity and higher proﬁt per employee.
Results for the test of the direct link between these variables are shown in
Table 2. It should be noted that labour turnover is based on reports from the
HR  managers, while  productivity  and  proﬁtability  are  based  on  Dun  and
Bradstreet data.

The results show that there is a signiﬁcant association between greater use
of HR  practices  and  lower  reported  levels  of labour  turnover  (beta -0.14;
p < 0.01). When the association between HRM and labour turnover is exam-
ined by sector, the results remain signiﬁcant in manufacturing (beta -0.18;
p < 0.01)  but  not  in  services  (beta  -0.10, n.s.). We  tested  for  the  interac-
tion  effect  between  sector  and  HR  practices, entering  the  interaction 
after  HR  practices, but  the  results  showed  no  signiﬁcant  interaction  (beta
0.05, n.s.).

The results show no signiﬁcant association between HR practices and pro-
ductivity  (beta  0.05, n.s.). However, productivity  is  signiﬁcantly  associated
with sector and appears to be higher in the service sector (beta 0.17; p < 0.05).
An  analysis  within  each  sector  shows  that  there  is  no  association  between
HRM and productivity in either sector (beta 0.00; n.s. in manufacturing and
beta 0.13, n.s. in services).

In contrast to productivity — and therefore somewhat unexpectedly, since
it is the more distal measure — Table 2 indicates that there is a signiﬁcant
association  between  HRM  and  proﬁt  per  employee  (beta  0.11; p < 0.05).
Although there is no signiﬁcant effect for sector in the initial regression analy-
sis, a  more  detailed  sector-by-sector  analysis  indicates  that  the  association
between  HRM  and  ﬁnancial  performance  is  stronger  in  manufacturing

(beta 0.18; p < 0.01) than in services (beta -0.04; n.s.) and suggests that the
positive  association  in  the  full  sample  is  explained  almost  entirely  by  the
results for the manufacturing sector. This is conﬁrmed when we interact HR
practices  and  sector  (beta  -0.12; p < 0.05). In  other  words, it  appears 
that greater use of HR practices has a positive link to proﬁt per employee in
manufacturing but little or no association in the service sector.

We tested the impact of HRM on change in productivity and proﬁtability
between  1999  and  2000, controlling  for  the  average  performance  over  the
years from 1997 to 1999.5 It was not possible to explore labour turnover in
this  way, since  data  were  available  only  for  1999. The  results  are  shown  in
Table 3.

The data on productivity continue to show no association with greater use
of HRM for the sample as a whole (beta -01, n.s.) or for the sub-samples of
manufacturing (beta -0.03, n.s.) or service-sector ﬁrms (beta 0.02, n.s.). Simi-
larly, once controls for previous proﬁtability are included, there is no asso-
ciation between HRM and proﬁtability for the sample as a whole (beta 0.02,
n.s.) or for the manufacturing (beta 0.08, n.s.) and service (-0.10, n.s.) sectors.
In summary, there is partial support for Hypotheses 1a and 1c based on
the test of association. There is no support for Hypothesis 1b proposing an
association between HRM and productivity. Greater use of HR practices is
associated with lower labour turnover on a cross-sectional analysis. Greater
use of HR practices is associated with higher proﬁtability in the subsequent
year, at least in the manufacturing sector, but this association disappears once
proﬁtability in previous years is taken into account.

HR Practices and Subjective Estimates of Firm Performance

This analysis is based on the interview data provided by HR managers in the
366 ﬁrms for which ﬁnancial data were available. They are inevitably cross-
sectional data, and this should be borne in mind in making comparisons. The
same regressions were applied, but using comparative estimates of produc-
tivity and ﬁnancial performance as the dependent variables. The results are
shown in Table 4.

Looking ﬁrst at all 366 ﬁrms, the ﬁrst two columns in Table 4 show that
there is a signiﬁcant association between greater use of HR practices and esti-
mates of both productivity (beta 0.19; p < 0.000) and ﬁnancial performance
(beta 0.12; p < 0.05). The results in other columns in Table 4 indicate that
ﬁrms in both manufacturing and service sectors show a similar set of asso-
ciations to the overall sample with respect to estimated productivity. Greater
use of HR practices is signiﬁcantly associated with higher estimated produc-
tivity (beta 0.19; p < 0.001 in manufacturing and beta 0.18; p < 0.05 in ser-
vices). The  results  for  ﬁnancial  performance  in  the  two  sectors  are  less
clear-cut. In both sectors the association between HR practices and estimated
ﬁnancial performance falls just short of signiﬁcance (beta 0.10, n.s., in man-
ufacturing and beta 0.13, n.s., in services).

In  summary, there  is  evidence, based  on  estimates  of productivity  and
ﬁnancial performance, of a positive association between greater use of HR
practices  and  superior  performance; but, in  contrast  to  the  objective  mea-
sures, the association is greater with productivity than with ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. When  subjective  estimates  of performance  are  used, there  are  no
major differences between the results for the two sectors. The results based
on objective and subjective measures of performance differ in a number of
ways. We  must  therefore  reject  Hypothesis  2, which  suggested  that  there
would  be  similar  set  of results  using  objective  and  subjective  performance
measures.

6. Discussion and conclusions

This study set out to explore the relationship between HRM and performance
for a sizeable sample of UK organizations in the manufacturing and service
sectors. The results are very mixed and on balance predominantly negative.
The tests of association show a positive relationship between use of more HR
practices  and  lower  labour  turnover  and  higher  proﬁtability, but  show  no
association between HR and productivity. The test of whether the presence
of more HR practices results in a change in performance shows no signiﬁ-
cant results.

These results are consistent with the argument that the beneﬁts of HR have
accrued  in  previous  years  and  therefore, while  reﬂected  in  the  association
between HRM and proﬁtability, do not show up in further gains when prior
performance is controlled. However, this argument must be viewed with con-
siderable caution. Inspection of Table 1 shows a correlation of 0.12 between

HRM and proﬁtability in the 2000–01 ﬁnancial year but one of 0.21 between
HRM  and  average  proﬁtability  in  the  years  between  1997  and  1999. This
appears to lend stronger support to the view that proﬁtability creates scope
for more HRM rather than vice versa. Therefore, while the results reveal a
positive association between HRM and proﬁtability, they do not support the
assumption that HRM led to the higher proﬁtability. Future research might
try  to  determine  when  speciﬁc  practices  were  introduced  as  a  means  of
exploring  whether  there  is  any  real  causal  effect  that  has  not  already  been
accounted for in increased performance once they have been in place for some
time. However, attempts  to  measure  the  introduction  of practices  that  are
likely to have existed in some form for a number of years are fraught with
difﬁculty.

Disaggregation  of the  results  to  compare  the  manufacturing  and  service
sectors  revealed  no  consistent  differences, with  a  single  notable  exception:
both  the  disaggregated  analysis  and  the  interaction  effect  conﬁrm  that  the
association  between  HRM  and  the  objective  measure  of performance  is
stronger in manufacturing than in services. Given the arguments about the
potential role of HRM in service effectiveness, and bearing in mind the pos-
itive results obtained by Batt (2002) and others, this is a surprising ﬁnding.
Why have we found these different results? We used two sources of data to
explore this issue further. One is the Workplace Employee Relations Survey
(WERS)  (Cully  et  al. 1999), the  other  is  the  background  information  pro-
vided for a subset of the ﬁrms by the CEOs who were interviewed.

The ﬁrst step was to examine the WERS data, recognizing that they are
based  on  establishment  rather  than  company-level  research, to  ﬁnd  out
whether  similar  results  would  be  found. Using  regression  equations  con-
structed as far as possible in a similar way to those in this study, the analy-
sis revealed that there was a signiﬁcant association between having a greater
number of HR practices in place and estimates of comparative ﬁnancial per-
formance in both sectors (manufacturing: beta 0.27; p < 0.05; services: beta
0.16; p < 000). Since these results ask for comparisons within the sector, they
are  not  directly  comparable  with  proﬁt  per  employee. However, we  might
expect them to be more in line with the subjective estimates provided by the
managers in the Future of Work study and, as our results have shown, this
was indeed the case.

The second step was to examine the data on context provided by the CEOs
in  the  manufacturing  and  service  ﬁrms  to  search  for  any  differences  that
might help to explain the ﬁndings. Data were available on both the market
and  the  level  of competition  within  it  for  144  ﬁrms  in  the  sample  of 366.
Based on this subgroup, the analysis suggests that manufacturing ﬁrms are
more likely than service ﬁrms to report that the main market for their key
products  is  overseas, and  they  are  more  likely  to  sell  at  least  5  per  cent  of
their main product to a single customer. Not surprisingly, they are also more
likely to see overseas ﬁrms as major competitors. Another and largely pre-
dictable difference is that manufacturing ﬁrms are likely to spend more on
R&D. It  is  also  notable  that  in  the  manufacturing  sector  being  a  multina-

tional organization is likely to be associated with higher performance, while
in services it is more likely to be associated with lower performance.

We  hypothesized  that  there  would  be  no  differences  in  the  results  when
using objective and subjective measures of performance. As noted, the dif-
ferences  between  the  manufacturing  and  service-sector  results  are  stronger
when the more objective and independent information provided by Dun and
Bradstreet is used than with the subjective comparisons provided by the man-
agers. Indeed, the association between HRM and performance is consistently
positive when the subjective performance measures are used. Furthermore,
the subjective measures show a stronger association between HRM and pro-
ductivity than between HRM and ﬁnancial performance, in line with expec-
tations  and  in  contrast  to  the  results  using  the  objective  measures. It  is
important to emphasize that we are not comparing like with like. Indeed, as
noted earlier, the correlation between average sales per employee from 1997
to 1999 and estimated productivity is only 0.06, while the correlation between
proﬁt per employee in the same period and estimated ﬁnancial performance
is a rather more encouraging 0.33. It is, for example, possible to report low
‘objective’ proﬁt  per  employee  and  also  high  comparative  ﬁnancial  perfor-
mance when set alongside that of competitors. It is also important to bear in
mind that the subjective results are cross-sectional.

Given  the  relatively  limited  impact  of HRM  on  performance, one  pos-
sibility  is  that  other  formal  features  of the  employment  relationship  were
more important. The evidence, based on analysis of the impact of the control
variables in the regression analysis, shows that this was not the case. Union
density and union recognition were very highly correlated, and just over half
the ﬁrms that had a union density of over 25 per cent also had a single union
deal. In the regressions, a single union deal was associated with lower sub-
jective estimates of manufacturing productivity, and the presence of a con-
sultative  committee  was  associated  with  lower  labour  turnover, notably  in
manufacturing. Other contextual factors such as size, being a multinational
and using HR to control costs had a stronger association with outcomes than
the formal aspects of the employment relationship.

A distinctive feature of this study has been the use of a variety of research
strategies  along  three  dimensions. The  performance  measures  are  either 
subjective  or  objective; the  data  are  collected  cross-sectionally  and  over 
time; and the key test is one of either association or causation. The results
vary according to the methods used, and they fall into a distinctive pattern.
Essentially, when  we  use  what  might  be  described  as  the  weaker  tests,
namely subjective performance estimates in cross-sectional data, to explore
associations, the  results  show  a  positive  relationship  between  HRM  and 
performance. With  what  we  can  term  ‘intermediate  tests’, consisting  of
objective performance measures, collected after the introduction of HRM but
still testing for association, the results are mixed. When we apply the strict
test, using objective performance measures, controlling for past performance
and testing for change in performance, then no associations of any sort are
found.

Human Resource Management and Performance

In summary, the results depend on the speciﬁc research question explored,
the measures used and the test applied. If we are interested in demonstrating
an association between greater use of HR practices and performance, then
the results are generally positive; if we are more interested in showing that
HR  practices  are  associated  with  a  change  in  performance, then  they  are 
negative.

We are still left with the question of why, when the stricter tests are used,
the results of this study appear to be more negative than many other pub-
lished studies in showing little or no association between HRM and perfor-
mance. One possible explanation lies in the choice of measure of HRM. This
study has been concerned with HR practices rather than HR strategy, busi-
ness strategy and the strategic context. This reﬂects the dominant ﬁnding in
most American studies suggesting that ‘internal ﬁt’, based on some count of
HR  practices  and  assumptions  about  their  alignment, provides  the  more
important link to outcomes (Becker and Huselid 1998). We used a measure
of HR practices that sought to capture the concept of an HR system, and
therefore combined the scores on the nine core HR practices. We also used a
strict cut-off whereby the practices had to apply to 90 per cent of the work-
force. As noted earlier, this reﬂected the view that a distinctive feature of some
models of HRM is that practices should apply to the whole workforce. Some
experimentation, based  on  a  lower  percentage  cut-off point, a  continuum
from  0  to  100  per  cent  or  different  combinations  of practices  based  on
notions  of a  high-performance  or  high-commitment  work  system, did  not
signiﬁcantly alter the results. Therefore, while acknowledging that different
ways of measuring HR practices are possible and that these may be based on
different theories about what constitutes HRM, we do not believe that they
would signiﬁcantly alter the results in this study. The neglect of the strategic
dimension of ‘external ﬁt’ in this paper is a limitation, but it is based on pre-
vious evidence about the key associations.

Further explanations for the absence of evidence about the impact of HRM
on performance may lie in the sample and context. There is some evidence that
parts of the service sector are under-represented. However, there is a strong
representation from manufacturing, and even in this sector the results fail to
demonstrate any causal link between HRM and performance. It is possible
that a study of this type that is based in the European context may reﬂect some
of the constraints highlighted by Pauuwe (1996: 88) such as the need to impose
a set of relatively standard employment practices, and the somewhat stronger
traditions  of taking  some  account  of stakeholder  interests; but  this  seems
unlikely. We are therefore left with the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that
these results, in what is probably the largest company-level UK study to date,
show some evidence of an association between HRM and performance but,
in the absence of evidence about when HR practices were introduced, fails to
provide any convincing indication that greater application of HRM is likely
to result in improved corporate performance.

Notes

1. The study also included interviews with 462 chief executives, including 237 from
ﬁrms where the HR manager was also interviewed. Since detailed information on
HR practices was collected only from the HR managers, it was decided to omit the
CEO data from this study. The disadvantage of this is that they provided the infor-
mation on strategy and context. Furthermore, since we had ﬁnancial data on only
144 of the ﬁrms for which we had matched pairs of responses, this would have con-
siderably  reduced  the  sample  size. Further  details  of the  CEO  responses  can  be
found in Guest et al. (2000).

2. In this context it is worth noting that 63 per cent of CEOs in the study said they
benchmarked  ﬁnancial  performance, and  44  per  cent  said  they  benchmarked
labour productivity, so there is some basis for the comparisons. Questions about
benchmarking were not put to the HR managers.

3. In both cases we considered using the log of sales or proﬁt per employee. However,
there was no evidence of an abnormal distribution so we did not use the log scores
in the reported analysis. We did in fact test the results using log scores, and they
were not signiﬁcantly different.

4. Even when a different cut-off point, such as use of practices with 50 per cent or

more of the workforce, was used, the adoption of practices remained low.

5. We used the three-year period 1997–99 because the data for 1996 were less com-

plete for a number of companies in the sample.
