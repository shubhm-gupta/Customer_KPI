KEEPING YOUR HEADCOUNT WHEN ALL ABOUT YOU ARE
LOSING THEIRS: DOWNSIZING, VOLUNTARY TURNOVER

RATES, AND THE MODERATING ROLE

OF HR PRACTICES

CHARLIE O. TREVOR

University of Wisconsin–Madison

Although both downsizing and voluntary turnover have been topics of great interest in
the organizational literature, little research addresses the topics’ possible relationship.
Using organization-level data from multiple industries, we first investigate whether
downsizing predicts voluntary turnover rates. Second, to support our causal model, we
examine whether aggregated levels of organizational commitment mediate this rela-
tionship. Third, we test whether the downsizing–turnover rate relationship is (1)
mitigated by HR practices that either embed employees in their organization or convey
procedural fairness and (2) strengthened by HR practices that enhance career devel-
opment. Results support the hypothesized main, mediated, and moderated effects.

Downsizing is commonplace today, with deploy-
ment of the strategy constrained by neither com-
pany financial health nor employee type (Cascio,
2002a). Given the enormous organizational, indi-
vidual, and societal implications of downsizing,
the phenomenon warrants, and is receiving, sub-
stantial research attention. Much of the downsizing
research involves effects on either employee atti-
tudes or organizational performance. Researchers
know very little, however, about downsizing effects
on the critical employee behaviors that likely ac-
company these attitudes and affect organizational
performance. Perhaps the most telling of these be-
haviors is voluntary employee turnover.

For at least three reasons, assessments of down-
sizing viability or success appear to be incomplete
if turnover implications are not considered. First,
companies undertake downsizing—a planned re-
duction in their number of employees (Cascio,
1993)—to reduce headcount to some target level.
Consequently, unexpected subsequent turnover es-
sentially translates into missing that target and
leaving the leaner organization understaffed, and
thus hindered in its efficiency. Second, turnover-
related financial costs, which include employee
replacement, training, and outplacement (Cascio,
2000; Sturman, Trevor, Boudreau, & Gerhart, 2003)
are quite high, with per-leaver estimates often dou-
ble leaver salary (e.g., Johnson, 1995; Solomon,

1988). Given that downsizing is undertaken pri-
marily as a cost-cutting measure (Cascio, 1993,
2002b), incurring unforeseen expenses of this mag-
nitude may jeopardize its success. Third, although
evidence on the relationship between downsizing
and organizational performance is mixed (Cappelli,
2000; Madrick, 1995), turnover rates may shed light
on the dynamic. Chadwick, Hunter, and Walston
(2004) found that the performance of hospitals that
downsized appeared to benefit from the high-in-
volvement human resource (HR) practices that sev-
eral studies (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Batt, 2002; Guthrie,
2001; Huselid, 1995) have shown to reduce turn-
over rates. Moreover, recent research indicates that
turnover rates are negatively associated with busi-
ness unit and organizational success (Glebbeek &
Bax, 2004; Kacmar, Andrews, Rooy, Steilberg, &
Cerrone, 2006; McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001;
Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2005). Thus, turnover rates,
as well as the HR practices that affect them, may be
key elements in understanding how, and when,
downsizing influences organizational performance.
The downsizing-turnover relationship is also of
considerable interest from the perspective of vol-
untary turnover research itself. Because more valu-
able employees are more likely to facilitate organi-
zational success, the field is becoming increasingly
focused on their retention (e.g., Lavelle, 2003; Lee,
Mitchell, Sablynski, Burton, & Holtom, 2004; Stur-
man et al., 2003; Trevor, 2001; Trevor, Gerhart, &
Boudreau, 1997). Hence, studying voluntary turn-
over among downsizing survivors, who have been
earmarked as the employees most worth keeping
(Martin & Bartol, 1985), is especially relevant. Such

research also should provide insights into the un-
folding model of turnover (Lee, Mitchell, Wise, &
Fireman, 1996), a major recent addition to the lit-
erature whose key tenets have received little atten-
tion in multivariate predictive models.

Despite the organizational performance and vol-
untary turnover implications of downsizing, only
one study (Batt, Colvin, & Keefe, 2002) has tested
whether downsizing predicts voluntary turnover
rates. Consequently, we used a broad sample to
explore the relationship, the untested contention
that organizational commitment mediates this as-
sociation, and the extent to which the relationship
depends on how organizations manage their hu-
man resources.

CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT

AND HYPOTHESES

Three issues require clarification before we de-
rive our hypotheses. First, the unfolding model of
turnover (Lee et al., 1996) describes how turnover
decisions can be functions of “shocks” (i.e., jarring
events for employees), with downsizing cited as
one such shock (Holtom, Mitchell, Lee, & Inder-
rieden, 2005). We focus on the shock implications
of both downsizing as an event and the severity
(i.e., magnitude) of the downsizing. The event as-
pect is evident in Lee and Mitchell’s definition of a
shock as a “very distinguishable event that jars
employees toward deliberate judgments about their
jobs and, perhaps, to voluntarily quit their job”
(1994: 60). The severity emphasis evolves from our
assumption that larger downsizings are more jar-
ring, shocking, and threatening than are smaller
downsizings; this logic is consistent with downsiz-
ing’s operationalization as a percentage or propor-
tion in prior downsizing research (e.g., Batt et al.,
2002). Second, although downsizing is a multifac-
eted process, our treatment focuses on layoffs. Be-
cause such job loss is involuntary, layoffs represent
downsizing at its most severe and are particularly
consistent with the notion of downsizing as a “psy-
chological contract” violation (Robinson & Rous-
seau, 1994) and, thus, a jarring event, or shock, that
may prompt surviving employees to consider leav-
ing. Third, we primarily rely on individual-level
theories to derive organization-level predictions.
Recent work indicates that organization-level turn-
over findings (e.g., Batt et al., 2002; McElroy et al.,
2001; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998; Shaw
et al., 2005) are consistent with expectations in-
ferred from individual-level frameworks; similarly,
researchers have used individual-level perspec-
tives on organizational commitment both to specu-
late about organization-level relationships involv-

ing turnover (e.g., Batt et al., 2002; Huselid, 1995;
Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998) and, via aggregation, to
test such relationships (e.g., Simons & Roberson,
2003).

Downsizing and Voluntary Turnover Rates

Main effect. The unfolding model of turnover
describes psychological and behavioral paths that
employees take when quitting (Lee et al., 1996). In
the model’s most commonly followed turnover
path (path 3), a shock leads employees to reevalu-
ate their current work circumstances, consider job
alternatives, and then quit, usually to take another
job offer or to pursue a likely offer. The results of
substantial
individual-level research addressing
the effects of downsizing on survivor attitudes are
consistent with this path and the presumption that
downsizing is an unpleasant shock that prompts
fear and resentment. Downsizing has been found
to negatively affect organizational commitment
(Brockner, Grover, Reed, Dewitt, & O’Malley, 1987;
Knudsen, Johnson, Martin, & Roman, 2003), job
satisfaction (Armstrong-Stassen, 2002; Luthans &
Sommer, 1999), job involvement (Brockner, Grover,
& Blonder, 1988), and trust (Armstrong-Stassen,
2002). Given that such attitudes, particularly organ-
izational commitment and job satisfaction, consis-
tently predict voluntary turnover (e.g., Tett &
Meyer, 1993), even at the business-unit level (e.g.,
Simons & Roberson, 2003), a positive downsizing-
turnover relationship seems likely. Indeed, in the
only study to examine the relationship, Batt et al.
(2002) showed a positive link between the percent-
age of core employees displaced and quit rates in
the telecommunications industry.

It is possible, however, that despite the attitudi-
nal fallout, downsizing survivors are not more
likely to leave. Surviving job cuts, especially if the
downsizing is attributed to strategic restructuring
rather than simple cost cutting, could lead to
greater appreciation of what one has, a perception
of relative safety (i.e., having “dodged a bullet”),
expectations of more varied work, and belief that
the company is positioned to excel. Overall, how-
ever, we believe it unlikely that such retention-
enhancing impressions will fully counteract the
negative attitudinal effects described above. Hence,
we first attempted to replicate the Batt et al. (2002)
finding in a broad sample of occupations, firms,
and industries.

to voluntary turnover rates.

fects on voluntary turnover are central to so many

turnover models (e.g., Gerhart, 1990; Hom, Carani-
kas-Walker, & Prussia, 1992; March & Simon, 1958;
Mobley, 1977; Trevor, 2001), support for Hypothe-
sis 1 will be enhanced if a relevant (aggregated)
employee attitude emerges as a mediator. Mishra
and Spreitzer’s (1998) conceptual model positions
organizational commitment as such a mediator,
and Batt et al. (2002) speculated that their down-
sizing– quit rate finding stemmed from employees’
perceiving a threat to employment security and
subsequently having reduced organizational com-
mitment. Further, empirical work identifies organ-
izational commitment as both a downsizing conse-
quence (e.g., Brockner et al., 1987; Knudsen et al.,
2003) and a voluntary turnover antecedent (Tett &
Meyer, 1993 [meta-analysis]).

Hypothesis 2. Organizational commitment me-
diates the positive relationship between down-
sizing and voluntary turnover rates.

the organizational

level
turnover prediction at
should be highly context-dependent. Our proposed
interactions are consistent with a general contin-
gency framework that stems from the unfolding
model of turnover: a shock such as downsizing will
often result in employee scrutiny of a current job
situation, which is then followed by job search,
evaluation of alternative offers, and, depending on
the evaluation results, quitting or staying (Holtom
et al., 2005; Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001). Thus, a
downsizing shock that jars an employee onto this
most common of turnover pathways leads to a quit
or stay decision based on an analysis of the utility
of (i.e., the value of and satisfaction with) one’s
current employment relative to the expected utility
of alternative employment. We argue that HR prac-
tice dimensions moderate downsizing effects by
affecting these postdownsizing utility levels. Fig-
ure 1 depicts these relationships.

scrutiny of the employment context. This scrutiny involves a comparison of the utilities of current and alternative employment. We argue
that HR practices largely determine the results of this comparison, and thus the extent to which downsizing affects voluntary turnover
rates.

tiny of an employment situation. Two of these HR
practice dimensions may buffer (i.e., limit) the
negative impact of downsizing on current em-
ployment utility and subsequent turnover. Ex-
actly how this buffering effect occurs, however,
depends on whether the HR practice dimension
promotes perceptions of procedural justice or per-
ceptions of job embeddedness.

Procedural justice. Procedural justice is the fair-
ness of procedures used in decisions that affect
employees (Folger & Greenberg, 1985). The poten-
tial for HR practices associated with perceived pro-
cedural justice to buffer downsizing effects stems
from the fact that employment outcomes (e.g., pay)
received over the long term are— given their large
impact on material gains—seen as more important
than a single short-term outcome. Procedural jus-
tice perceptions fuel optimism regarding these crit-
ical long-term outcomes, since fair processes sug-
gest, even in light of short-term disappointment,
that favorable outcomes lay ahead. This conviction
leads people to assign less weight to, and be less
affected by, short-term outcomes; indeed, a variety
of empirical work indicates that a single employ-
ment outcome has a smaller effect in the presence
of procedurally just conditions associated with the
outcome’s allocation (Brockner & Wiesenfeld,
1996). This contingency suggests that, given HR
practices that promote procedural justice percep-
tions (e.g., a grievance or appeals process, a confi-
dential problem-solving avenue, an ombudsperson
designated for complaint resolution), the unfavor-
able short-term downsizing outcome will yield a
smaller decrement in current employment utility;
hence, high levels of such practices should reduce
the effect of the downsizing shock on voluntary
turnover.1

Hypothesis 3. Downsizing’s positive relation-
ship with voluntary turnover rates diminish at
high levels of HR practices likely to promote
procedural justice perceptions.

1 Our position implies that procedural justice percep-
tions other than those solely associated with a downsiz-
ing event itself will reduce downsizing impact. As de-
scribed above, procedural justice in one domain can
reduce the effects of distributive outcomes because it can
lead people to infer that they will be treated justly, and
thus likely will fare well, in the future (Brockner &
Wiesenfeld, 1996). Given this stipulation of procedural
justice generalizing from one domain to another, HR
practices likely to yield procedural justice perceptions
not specific to downsizing should also be likely to miti-
gate downsizing effects by yielding optimism regarding
future treatment.

Job embeddedness. The second HR practice di-
mension of interest from the perspective of buffer-
ing downsizing spillover is job embeddedness,
which is the level to which employees’ are bound
in a social web (both on and off the job) that keeps
them attached to their organization (Lee et al.,
2004; Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, & Erez,
2001). To examine whether employment outcomes
that tie employees’ lives to their current employer
reduce downsizing effects on turnover, we created
a job embeddedness index from five practices that
researchers (Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001; Mitch-
ell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, & Erez, 2001) have
specifically identified as contributing to job embed-
dedness perceptions (i.e., defined benefits plans,
sabbaticals, on-site childcare, hiring for organiza-
tional fit, and flextime).

Although Mitchell, Holtom, and Lee stated that
job embeddedness “seems to buffer the individual
from the effects of shocks that might otherwise
prompt one to leave” (2001: 104), empirical re-
search has yet to explicitly test whether shock ef-
fects depend on either job embeddedness or the
practices that lead to it. A specific rationale for
expecting this interdependence is evident in a dis-
cussion of multiple employment outcomes that
Brockner and Wiesenfeld (1996) provided as an
extension of their procedural justice moderation
logic that we described above. Those authors ar-
gued that, because people prefer positive outcomes,
an unfavorable outcome in an exchange relation-
ship may lead to greater attention to other relevant
outcomes in the relationship. This premise, re-
cently supported in a multiple pay outcome con-
text (Trevor & Wazeter, 2006), thus suggests that the
unfavorable downsizing outcome should lead to
greater scrutiny of other relevant employment out-
comes, such as those associated with the HR prac-
tices that yield job embeddedness perceptions (e.g.,
a defined benefit plan, on-site childcare, and fit
with the organization). This greater attention
should, at high levels of these embeddedness-rele-
vant HR practices, make heightened job embedded-
ness perceptions very salient; the heightened sense
of attachment, in turn, would constrain downsiz-
ing-driven reduction in current employment utility
and reduce downsizing effects on turnover rates. In
contrast, the unfavorable downsizing effect on em-
ployees should be greater at lower levels of embed-
dedness-relevant practices, where less favorable
outcomes mean that there is little sense of embed-
dedness and attachment to constrain downsizing-
driven reduction in the utility of the current em-
ployment (i.e., little buffering of the downsizing
shock).

Hypothesis 4. Downsizing’s positive relation-
ship with voluntary turnover rates diminishes
at high levels of HR practices likely to embed
employees in their organization.

HR Practices That Enhance Alternative
Employment Utility

Whereas our focus in the previous two hypothe-
ses was on HR practice dimensions that buffer
downsizing-driven reduction in the utility of cur-
rent employment, here we address practices that,
following a downsizing, should enhance the utility
of alternative employment. Because alternative em-
ployment options are functions of both job search
(e.g., Schwab, Rynes, & Aldag, 1987) and individ-
ual attributes that signal employee quality to the
market (e.g., Spence, 1973), we focus on HR prac-
tices that positively affect search and signaling ca-
pabilities. Career development practices, in partic-
ular, should foster these capacities.

At higher levels of career development practices
that enhance search (e.g., a career resource center,
formal employee assessment to identify develop-
ment opportunities) and/or signaling (e.g., formal
succession planning, a transfer policy to support
learning), employees should enjoy the ease of
movement in the job market that alternative em-
ployment options bring. In previous research using
employee quality signals (Trevor, 2001) and mar-
ket-level job availability (Carsten & Spector, 1987;
Gerhart, 1990; Trevor, 2001) as indications of high
levels of such ease of movement, job dissatisfaction
has been more likely to lead to voluntary turnover.
Thus, it also seems likely that downsizing-driven
attitudinal fallout and scrutiny of the employment
situation will be more likely to lead to quitting at
higher levels of career development practices that
enhance search, signaling, and subsequent alterna-
tive employment options (i.e., when ease of move-
ment is high). In other words, shocked employees
will be more likely to leave when HR practices
enhance alternative employment utility by helping
to provide better external job opportunities (see
Figure 1).

We recognize, however, that career development
practices also prepare employees for internal op-
portunities. As a downsizing shock drives employ-
ees to evaluate their current employment situation,
the perception of
internal movement potential
could enhance the utility of the current employ-
ment. On balance, however, we expect that career
development practices should do more, in the post-
downsizing environment of decaying commitment
and satisfaction, to enhance the utility of alterna-

tive employment (via improved search and signal-
ing) than to improve current employment utility.

Hypothesis 5. Downsizing’s positive relation-
ship with voluntary turnover rates strengthens
at high levels of HR practices likely to enhance
career development.

METHODS

Sample

Our sample consisted of employee-friendly com-
panies that were invited to submit detailed infor-
mation in applications to be included in the 1998
and 1999 Fortune magazine articles on “the 100
best companies to work for in America” (Branch,
1999; Levering & Moskowitz, 2000). Levering and
Moskowitz (2000) chose the invitees from their
own database of over 1,000 companies; criteria for
being invited to compete for the “100 Best” list
included minimum existence (ten years) and em-
ployment (500 people) levels, as well as simply
being considered by the authors to be a viable can-
didate. Of the 1998 invitees, 206 companies agreed
to complete the application process (Branch, 1999),
in 1999, 236 did so (Levering & Moskowitz, 2000).
Hence, we began with a sample of 442 company-
years. Missing data limited the sample for our mul-
tivariate turnover rate analyses to 106 companies in
1998 and 161 companies in 1999, for a total sample
of 267 company-years.

The organization-level data used here come
from an extensive company-level questionnaire de-
signed by Hewitt Associates, a management con-
sulting firm. Each company applying to be on the
Fortune “100 best” list was asked to complete this
questionnaire on management practices. The sur-
vey was typically filled out by a team of the com-
pany’s managers and human resource profession-
als.
the mean reported person-hours
devoted to the survey was 47.3, suggesting consid-
erable effort on the part of the respondents. Survey
items were in reference to United States– based
full-time exempt (i.e., salaried) and nonexempt
(i.e., hourly) employees.

In 1998,

Each company applying to be on the “100 best”
list also was required to administer an employee
attitude survey created by the Great Place to Work®
Institute. Although the attitudinal items used in
selecting companies for the list were proprietary
and unavailable to us, we did have access to two
other items collected from the applicant compa-
nies’ employees. In 1998 and 1999, the applying
companies were instructed to randomly survey 250
and 275 employees, respectively. Explicit direc-
tions for randomly sampling employees and ad-

ministering the attitude survey were provided to
each applicant. Companies distributed the ques-
tionnaires with preaddressed and stamped enve-
lopes. Employees were directed to return the ques-
tionnaires directly to the data processor at the Great
Place to Work® Institute, thus ensuring anonymity
and confidentiality. Companies applying to be on
the “100 best” list were also required to share the
precise sampling mechanism followed in distribut-
ing employee questionnaires. The authors of the
Fortune articles on the “100 best” companies (Le-
vering & Moskowitz, 2000) also checked for sam-
pling irregularities by comparing survey respon-
dent demographic
characteristics with each
company’s overall demographic characteristics,
which were reported in the company-level survey.
Response rates for companies averaged 53 percent
in 1998 and 52 percent in 1999.

Company and employee surveys were adminis-
tered in the summers of 1998 and 1999. For addi-
tional detail on the data acquisition, see Fulmer,
Gerhart, and Scott (2003).

Measures

Voluntary turnover rate. Company survey re-
spondents were asked to provide the number of
full-time voluntary leavers during the most recent
12 months and their number of full-time employees
from 12 months prior to the survey. We divided the
former by the latter to create the voluntary turnover
rate. We then took the natural logarithm of the
result to transform the highly skewed dependent
variable data to a more normal distribution.

Downsizing rate. The company survey asked for
the calendar year of the most recent reduction in
force. We considered an organization to have
downsized if its respondent reported a reduction in
force in the survey’s calendar year or in the preced-
ing two calendar years (e.g., a 1999 survey respon-
dent with a reported downsizing in 1999, 1998, or
1997). Although there is no research on how long
downsizing effects on survivors may persist, we
used the two preceding years because a shock that
eventually leads to quitting often necessitates a
considerable period of evaluation and search before
suitable alternative employment is found. On the
more recent end of the time frames, we included
current year (year t) downsizing in the measure for
three reasons. First, news and rumors of downsiz-
ing often precede the actual event, potentially
prompting pre-event voluntary turnover. Consis-
tent with this concern is Cascio’s (2002a) conten-
tion that employees tend not to be surprised by
layoffs and the finding of Swaen, Bultmann, Kant,
and Van Amelsvoort (2004), in which psychologi-

cal distress significantly increases both one month
after a downsizing announcement and before the
event itself. Second, including year t downsizing
was necessary to ensure that we captured the im-
mediate (within-year) effects on voluntary turn-
over. This was a particular concern given that
“turnover intentions” appear to peak, relative to
predownsizing levels, when measured closer to the
event itself (Allen, Freeman, Russell, Reizenstein,
& Rentz, 2001). Third, simultaneity concerns asso-
ciated with same-year downsizing and turnover
measures are minimal, as companies presumably
do not downsize in response to increased turnover.
The company survey also asked what percentage
of employees was downsized.2 The response,
which we first converted to a proportion, allowed
us to model the severity of the downsizing, under
the assumption that shock is greater following
larger downsizings. We then logged the highly
(positively) skewed downsizing rates (after adding
a constant of .0001 because the natural logarithm of
zero is undefined; see Cohen, Cohen, West, and
Aiken [2003]). Logging an independent variable en-
ables examination of underlying nonlinearity in
which effects are considerably larger at the lowest
levels of the raw values of that variable (Cohen et
al., 2003). This process allowed us to infer whether
the transition from nondownsizer to downsizer
(i.e., the event) carried shock effects in addition to
those carried by downsizing severity (we explore
this distinction further in the Results and Discus-
sion sections).

All company respondents reporting a downsiz-
ing also reported implications for “terminated em-
ployees in the most recent downsizing,” indicating
that all reported downsizings involved termina-
tions. Downsizings were reported in 102 cases (38
percent of the sample), with mean downsized pro-
portions of
.014 overall and .036 among the
downsizers.

HR practices as moderators. We used 12 mea-
sures to create three theoretically driven additive
indexes of HR practices. Working at the index,
rather than practice, level was consistent not only
with our theory, but also with considerable prior

2 Unfortunately, the item wording differed in the two
years, as the 1998 survey asked, “What percentage of
employees were dismissed due to the most recent down-
sizing?” and the 1999 survey asked, “What percentage of
employees left due to the most recent downsizing?”
Analysis of companies that were present in both years,
however, indicates that the two items were answered
from similar perspectives, as the correlation between re-
sponses to the 1998 item and the 1999 item (when refer-
ring to the same downsizing event) was .90.

research. Batt (2002) and Delery (1998), for exam-
ple, described theoretically driven additive indexes
in which higher scores meant greater investment in
a range of applicable practices, and similar results
emerged as a function of practices substituting for
one another in an index. An index of this type is
composed of multiple elements whose values are
not caused by an underlying construct but, when
summed, yield a value whose magnitude is rele-
vant to the construct (Batt & Valcour, 2003). Such
indexes are the preferred method for creating a
single measure from a series of underlying dimen-
sions that can be cumulated to determine the level
of a construct of interest (Shaw et al., 2005).

Six of the 12 HR practices used to create the
indexes were assessed separately for exempt and
nonexempt employees. Because organizations man-
age exempt and nonexempt employees differently
(Gerhart & Trevor, 1996; Lepak & Snell, 1999), this
separation allowed for greater precision in identify-
ing the extent to which a practice covered the overall
workforce. For example, since we knew the exempt/
nonexempt proportions for each organization, a com-
pany with 70 percent nonexempt employees that of-
fered a certain practice only for exempts would be
coded .30 (rather than a less representative 1). Thus,
our indexes reveal the presence and, to some extent,
the coverage of HR practices (though not the intensity
of employee use).

We created a procedural justice index to repre-
sent an organization’s commitment to providing
employees with a formal process for addressing
perceived injustices. Company survey respondents
were asked about the presence of “an ombudsman
who is designated to address any employee com-
plaints,” “a confidential hotline or other confiden-
tial problem/resolution/complaint center,” and “a
grievance or appeal process available to nonunion
employees.” Items were coded 1 for “yes” and the
values were then summed. The three items evolve
directly from the formal procedures section of
Moorman’s (1991) procedural justice scale, which
assesses the presence of procedures that “provide
opportunities to appeal or challenge,” “have all
sides affected by the decision represented,” and
“hear the concerns of all those affected.” Moor-
man’s formal procedures items originated in part
from Leventhal’s (1980) procedural justice rule of
correctability (i.e., correcting past wrongs via griev-
ance or appeals), which is consistent with our
items and is frequently the basis for procedural
justice measures in management research (e.g.,
Tepper & Taylor, 2003; Thau, Aquino, & Wittek,
2007).

Two of the three major dimensions of job embed-
dedness are fit (i.e., compatibility with one’s com-

pany and off-the-job environment) and sacrifice
(i.e., the cost of what would be given up by leaving)
(Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001). Thus, we created a
job embeddedness index of five HR practices that
should yield perceptions along these dimensions
(we did not have reliable HR practice measures of
links to coworkers, the third dimension of job em-
beddedness). Although the HR practices have never
been tested as predictors of job embeddedness per-
ceptions, Mitchell and his colleagues (Mitchell,
Holtom, & Lee, 2001; Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sa-
blynski, & Erez, 2001) explicitly emphasized cer-
tain practices as fostering job embeddedness. As
substantial sacrifices associated with leaving a job,
these authors cited defined benefits plans and sab-
baticals
(which become increasingly valuable
and/or available with increasing employee longev-
ity), and on-site childcare, which is related to crit-
ical off-the-job concerns. Regarding practices that
promote fit, hiring for organizational fit has been
described as increasing employee compatibility
with the culture and values of an organization
(Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001), and flextime has
been described as important to fit with off-the-job
considerations (Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, &
Erez, 2001). These practices also parallel items
used to assess job embeddedness perceptions (e.g.,
“I fit with the company’s culture” and “The retire-
ment benefits provided by this organization are
excellent”) from Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski,
and Erez (2001). To assess the job embeddedness
practices, the company survey inquired about the
presence of a defined benefits plan, paid sabbati-
cals, on-site childcare, and “flexible or nonstand-
ard arrival and departure times,” and the impor-
tance of organizational
in hiring decisions.
Respondents ranked the importance of fit on a 1–14
scale on which 1 equaled “the most important hir-
ing criterion”; we reversed these fit scores by sub-
tracting from 15. Because the paid sabbatical and
hiring-for-fit items separately addressed the ex-
empt and nonexempt populations, we weighted the
responses by exempt and nonexempt proportions
before combining. We then standardized and added
the scores for the five practices to create the job
embeddedness index.

fit

Similarly, we created a career development in-
dex tapping four practices likely to improve ability
to compete in the external job market via enhanced
signaling or search capabilities. The presence of a
career resource center demonstrates a company’s
willingness to commit resources to employee de-
velopment and should provide employees with
tools and strategies for enhancing their careers.
Companies were also asked about the presence of
“assessment of skills, knowledge, and abilities to

identify employees’ development opportunities”;
the existence of this practice should make employ-
ees more aware of their marketable characteristics
and possible career paths. Together, these two prac-
tices (career resource center and employee assess-
ment) appear likely to enhance search efficiency.
The presence of formal succession planning often
involves a variety of developmental activities, such
as education, rotation through various jobs and lo-
cations, and special (visible) assignments (Noe,
Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2003). Such activi-
ties are likely to leave employees with greater sig-
naling capabilities. Although succession planning
is often confined to the management and profes-
sional levels, over 30 percent of our companies
reported using it for nonexempt populations. Fi-
nally, the presence of a formal policy enabling ei-
ther voluntary or required transfers “to support
learning (e.g., international assignments)” should
broaden employee experience and improve signal-
ing on the job market (we used an affirmative re-
sponse to either the voluntary or required formal
transfer items as a single indicator). All four prac-
tices were asked about for both exempt and nonex-
empt populations, enabling us to weight the re-
sponses by their respective proportions before
combining. We then standardized and added the
four scores to create the index.3

Because the substitutable elements in theoreti-
cally driven additive indexes are not equivalent
measures of an underlying construct, it is inappro-
priate to use an internal consistency reliability
measure (e.g., coefficient alpha) to test the level of
agreement among the elements (Batt & Valcour,
2003; Delery, 1998; Shaw et al., 2005). Test-retest
correlations, however, yielded reasonable evidence
for the stability of the three indexes. For the 67
companies in our analyses that provided surveys in
both 1998 and 1999, we found year-to-year corre-
lations of .78 for the procedural justice index, .73
for the job embeddedness index, and .75 for the
career development index.

Organizational commitment. The 1998 and
1999 employee attitude data from each company
included two slightly modifed items from Mowday,
Steers, and Porter’s (1979) Organizational Commit-
ment Questionnaire: “It would take a lot to get me

3 Although the company surveys included an item on
hours devoted to training, there was no indication as to
the extent to which training was firm-specific (and likely
enhanced current employment utility) or general (and
likely enhanced alternative employment utility via sig-
naling). Thus, we did not include the item, as its rele-
vance to our theoretically driven index was unknown.

to leave this organization” and “I am glad I chose
this organization over others I was considering
when I joined.” These two items were scored on a
scale anchored by “almost always untrue” (1) and
“almost always true” (5). Coefficient alpha for all
employee responses to these two questions was .84.
We created the individual-level commitment score
by summing the two item scores and dividing
by two.

To determine whether aggregating these commit-
ment scores to the organization level was appropri-
ate, we followed the approach of recent studies
using aggregated employee attitudes (e.g., Currall,
Towler, Judge, & Kohn, 2005; Fulmer et al., 2003;
Whitener, 2001), including organizational commit-
ment (e.g., Simons & Roberson, 2003). We first cal-
culated the intraclass correlations (Shrout & Fleiss,
1979) of our commitment variable to estimate the
reliability of a single employee response, obtaining
an ICC(1, 1) of .056 in 1998 and .064 in 1999.
Because our focus was on the company average
score as a reliable differentiator among firms, how-
ever, the ICC(1, k) was more relevant (Fulmer et al.,
2003; Glick, 1985). Bliese (1998) demonstrated that
even low ICC(1, 1) levels may lead to reliable ag-
gregate means with sufficiently large groups. With an
average of 137 responses per company in 1998 (min.
⫽ 41; max. ⫽ 754) and 147 responses per company
in 1999 (min. ⫽ 62; max. ⫽ 801), our ICC(1, k) was
.89 in 1998 and .91 in 1999. These values indicate
that the mean level of commitment was indeed a
reliable differentiator of our companies, thus pro-
viding a foundation for averaging individual com-
mitment scores within companies to create organi-
zation-level commitment.

Additional control variables. By controlling for
the use of early retirement in the downsizing pro-
cess, we increased the probability that we were
seeing layoff effects in our downsizing measure.
We included a dummy variable coded 1 if a com-
pany indicated that an early retirement package
was made available in association with its down-
sizing event. Substantial organizational change, in-
dependent of downsizing, may alter the relation-
ship between employer and employees and may be
related to downsizing. We controlled for this po-
tential bias by including restructuring (company
respondents were asked, “Within the last 12
months, has your organization experienced any
mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs that
affected at least 5% of your employee popula-
tion?”). Because labor costs often drive downsizing
decisions (Cascio, 1993), and because pay is often
related to turnover, we accounted for pay level,
measured as the response on a four-point scale
indicating whether the company targeted compen-

sation below market level, at market level, between
the 51st and 74th percentiles, or between the 75th
and 100th percentiles. Also, given possible associ-
ations with downsizing and turnover, we con-
trolled for organization age, proportion male (em-
ployees), proportion exempt, proportion union,
proportion aged 25 years or less, proportion with
less than 2 years service, number of employees
(logged), and the proportion of change in employ-
ees from year t to year t – 1. Industry health may
affect both downsizing likelihood and turnover
rates. Thus, we also included dummy variables to
account for the effects of the 48 industries in our
data at the two-digit SIC code level. Finally, to
more precisely account for industry-specific labor
demand, we controlled for two-digit industry un-
employment rate data obtained from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/).

Data Analysis

Researchers modeling turnover rates have used
both ordinary least squares (OLS) regression anal-
ysis (e.g., Shaw et al., 1998) and Tobit regression
analysis (e.g., Batt et al., 2002). Tobit models were
originally derived because a concentration of obser-
vations at some limiting lower or upper value vio-
lates OLS assumptions. Absent such observations,
however, OLS is appropriate (Tobin, 1958). Be-
cause we had no turnover rates equal to zero, we

present OLS analyses. Unreported Tobit models,
with censoring stipulated for very low rates,
yielded highly similar results. Additionally, be-
cause 67 companies provided company-year obser-
vations for both 1998 and 1999, we used robust
variance estimators with the standard regression
model. As an extension to variance estimators cre-
ated to account for heteroskedasticity (e.g., White,
1980), these also provide standard error estimates
that require only that observations be independent
across, but not necessarily within, the source of the
dependence (Rogers, 1993).

RESULTS

Main and Mediated Downsizing Effects

Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and
correlations. The essentially zero correlation between
downsizing rate and voluntary turnover rate is nei-
ther surprising nor indicative of lack of support for
our focal relationship. The covariation among the two
variables and several of our controls illustrates the
potential for a zero-order correlation to inflate or de-
flate the more valid relationship estimate from a cor-
rectly specified multivariate model.

Table 2 reports the results of the multivariate tests.
In support of Hypothesis 1, model 1 reveals that
downsizing rate has a statistically significant effect on
voluntary turnover rates. Specifically, a one-unit in-

crease in logged downsizing rate predicts a .058 in-
crease in logged turnover rate (coefficients in such
“log-log” modeling are often referred to in economics
as “elasticities” and are interpreted as the percent
change in the raw dependent variable predicted by a
1 percent change in the raw independent variable).
Marginal effects translated back into the original met-
rics of both variables yield more intuitive interpreta-
tion: the predicted raw turnover rate increases 25
percent (from .104 to .130) when going from non-
downsizing status to a downsizing rate of .005 (the
21st percentile of downsizing rate for companies that
did downsize). In comparison, companies that down-
size at rates of .02 (50th percentile of downsizers), .05
(75th percentile of downsizers), and .10 (93rd percen-
tile of downsizers) are predicted to have raw turnover

rate levels and increases (relative to nondownsizing
status) of .141 and 36 percent, .149 and 43 percent,
and .155 and 49 percent, respectively. Put another
way, over half of the raw turnover rate increase pro-
jected from reducing workforce by 10 percent occurs
as a result of cutting the first one-half of 1 percent of
employees. Figure 2 shows this relationship in the
graph on the top left.

As indicated in the figure, and in keeping with
Cohen et al.’s (2003) discussion of log transforma-
tions, our logging of downsizing rate allowed us to
transform into linearity an underlying nonlinear
relationship in which the effects on raw (or logged)
voluntary turnover rates are considerably larger at
low levels of raw downsizing rates. Because this
nonlinearity is an important empirical and concep-

Main and Moderating Downsizing Rate Effectsa

FIGURE 2

a Low and high x-axis levels of logged downsizing rates represent nondownsizers and the median downsizing rate among companies

that did downsize, respectively.

tual consideration that has yet to be explored in the
downsizing literature, we conducted an additional
analysis (available from the authors) to shed further
light on why the effects appeared to be so much
stronger at the point of transition from nondown-
sizer to downsizer. We reran models 1 and 3 after
replacing the logged downsizing rate with both a
downsizing dummy and the raw downsizing rate,
thus capturing downsizing events and their sever-
ity in separate variables in the same model. Both
variables had positive, statistically significant ef-
fects, further suggesting that both a downsizing
event and its severity uniquely contribute to turn-
over via shock. We return to this issue in the Dis-
cussion section.

In Hypothesis 2, we predict that aggregated or-
ganizational commitment will mediate the effect of
downsizing on turnover. Model 2 illustrates the
significant relationship between logged downsiz-
ing rate and commitment. In model 3, in which

organizational commitment is added to model 1 as
a predictor, commitment is a statistically signifi-
cant predictor of logged turnover rates, and the
downsizing coefficient is reduced by 25 percent,
thereby exhibiting partial mediation. More for-
mally, Sobel’s (1982) test revealed statistical sup-
port for mediation (p ⬍ .05).

Downsizing by HR Practice Index Interactions

Models 4 and 5 in Table 2 provide results sup-
porting the downsizing by procedural justice index
interaction predicted in Hypothesis 3 (the two
models are differentiated by the presence of com-
mitment). In model 4, for example, evaluating the
downsizing effect at one standard deviation above
and below the moderator mean indicates that the
relationship between logged downsizing rates and
logged voluntary turnover rates is about 3.5 times
greater when the procedural justice index is low


270

than it is when the index high. The graph on the
bottom left of Figure 2 illustrates this relationship.
In terms of marginal effects, downsizing .02 of a
workforce, which was the median rate for compa-
nies that downsized, predicts a raw turnover rate
increase of 63 percent when the procedural justice
index is low, but an increase of only 15 percent
when it is high.4

Models 4 and 5 also support Hypothesis 4. In
model 4, the relationship between logged downsiz-
ing rates and logged voluntary turnover rates is
almost four times greater when the job embedded-
ness index is low than when it is high, as the graph
on the top right of Figure 2 shows. Marginal effects
reveal that downsizing .02 of a workforce predicts a
raw turnover rate increase of 65 percent when the
job embeddedness index is low, but only an in-
crease of 14 percent when it is high.

Hypothesis 5 was also supported in both models.
The relationship between logged downsizing rates
and logged voluntary turnover rates in model 4 is
almost four times greater when the career develop-
ment index is high than when it is low; the bottom
right graph in Figure 2 illustrates this relationship.
Marginal effects reveal that downsizing .02 of a
workforce predicts a raw turnover rate increase of
13 percent when the career development index is
low, but an increase of 66 percent when it is high.

thus leaving only years t ⫺ 1 and t ⫺ 2 downsizing
to predict year t turnover. Support was weakened,
indicating that excluding shared variation between
same-year downsizing and turnover is problematic
in that much of the turnover driven by downsizing
likely occurs reasonably close to the event (see the
downsizing measure description for our rationale
for including year t downsizing). Third, we reex-
amined the interaction of downsizing and the ca-
reer development index after using only the trans-
fer policy and succession planning items to
comprise the index. The dropped items (career re-
source center and employee assessment) were in-
tended to reflect practices that would enhance em-
ployee search capabilities, but we wanted to check
that our career development index was not instead
capturing downsizers’ attempts to help downsizing
victims and other potential leavers find external
employment. The streamlined measure replicated
the original interaction finding, alleviating con-
cerns that we were misinterpreting downsizer en-
couragement of
turnover as search-and-signal-
driven turnover. Finally, although our focus was on
the whole downsizing effect, regardless of whether
the event was motivated by financial reasons, in-
cluding controls for return on assets and total
shareholder return did not materially change the
results.

Alternative Analyses

DISCUSSION

We conducted four additional variants of our
primary analyses to check the robustness of our
findings. First, although our robust standard errors
approach only requires independence between, but
not within, companies, we also conducted analyses
to ensure that the 67 companies that were present
in both 1998 and 1999 were not driving our results.
Dropping one of the observations for each of these
67 companies (e.g., dropping the 1999 observation)
yielded no meaningful changes, indicating that de-
pendent observations were not a major concern.
Second, we reran our analyses after reconfiguring
the downsizing variable so as to exclude year t,

4 A counterintuitive aspect of this interaction merits
mention. In the absence of downsizing, turnover rates
were higher when the procedural justice index was high
(see Figure 2, bottom left). A potential explanation is that
the practices in this index deal with the correction of
injustices (e.g., via grievance or appeals). As such, more
of these practices may be present when there are more
wrongs in need of righting. Such an environment may
contribute to voluntary turnover, especially in the ab-
sence of the focus on fair procedures that a downsizing
shock should bring.

In sum, we found a positive relationship between
downsizing rates and voluntary turnover rates, me-
diation of that relationship by aggregated levels of
organizational commitment, and moderation of the
downsizing effect by procedural justice, job embed-
dedness, and career development indexes. We next
address these findings in terms of modeling the
downsizing construct, implications for theory and
practice, limitations, and future research.

Modeling the Downsizing Construct

Although a larger downsizing event might be
thought likely to generate proportionally greater
shock than a small one, the unfolding model’s char-
acterization of shock as a very distinguishable
event (Lee & Mitchell, 1994) suggests that the
downsizing event in and of itself may be shocking.
That is, comparing the utilities of current and al-
ternative employment may be partially initiated
simply by the presence of downsizing, somewhat
irrespective of its severity. Our use of logged down-
sizing rate allowed us to model a linear relation-
ship that, when converted back into raw original
metrics, revealed a nonlinear relationship that sup-


2008

ports this interpretation. Moreover, our supple-
mentary analyses (available upon request) with a
downsizing dummy and the raw downsizing rate
provide further insight. Because the downsizing
event and its severity each contribute unique vari-
ance to voluntary turnover rates, shock appears to
manifest from the mere transition from nondown-
sizer to downsizer, as well as from workforce re-
duction magnitude. The effect size, which indi-
cates that the transition alone predicts a 19 percent
increase in turnover rates, highlights the impor-
tance of the transition to downsizer status. Thus,
researchers should carefully consider potential
nonlinear, event, and severity considerations when
conducting downsizing studies. Similarly, unfold-
ing model research would benefit from work that
recognizes the potentially unique shocks of an
event and its severity.

Implications for Theory

Our findings are consistent with traditional ap-
proaches to turnover that emphasize the compari-
son between current and alternative employment
utility that employees make when deciding to quit
or stay (e.g., March & Simon, 1958; Mobley, 1977).
The results also support the general logic of the
unfolding model of turnover (Lee et al., 1996), in
which shocks such as downsizing are argued to
prompt employees to engage in this comparison. As
such, we provide evidence that downsizing, and
perhaps shocks in general, addresses the same lack
of explained turnover variance that motivated the
unfolding model’s derivation (see Lee, Gerhart,
Weller, & Trevor [in press] for a related perspective
that focuses on unsolicited job offers as shocks
precipitating turnover).

We confirmed earlier speculation that downsiz-
ing should precipitate voluntary turnover through
reductions in commitment (e.g., Batt et al., 2002;
Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998), yet the mediation issue
remains complex. The partial (25%) mediation as-
pect is consistent with the unfolding model princi-
ple that shocks lead to turnover via attitudes under
certain conditions but lead to turnover irrespective
of attitudes under others. In addition to reflecting
unfolding model paths that do not involve atti-
tudes,
the nonmediated downsizing association
with voluntary turnover could indicate unmea-
sured downsizer tendencies to actively encourage
leaving behavior. Interestingly, we do not know
exactly where in our Figure 1 model, relative to the
interactions, the commitment mediation occurs.
One possibility is that commitment mediates the
moderated effects (i.e., the mediation occurs to the
right of the points of moderation in the model).

We would interpret this as HR practices moder-
ating the relationship between downsizing and
the commitment that ultimately predicts turnover.
Replacing the turnover-dependent variable with
commitment and rerunning the basic moderated
analysis, however, reveals little evidence of this, as
the interactions do not emerge. Moreover, commit-
ment mediation could occur at more than one place
in the model, suggesting that detecting its exact
location(s) may require finer-grained individual-
level data. The topic is a fruitful area for future
study.

Regardless of exactly where they fall relative to
commitment, our interactions provide nuanced
support for the unfolding model’s general logic.
That is, certain sets of HR practices reduced down-
sizing shocks’ effects on turnover, and others
strengthened it. Presumably,
job embeddedness
and procedural justice practices mitigate the extent
to which downsizing reduces current employment
utility. Similarly, we assume that career develop-
ment practices magnify the extent to which down-
sizing enhances the utility of alternative employers
(see Figure 1). These interactions support the or-
ganization-level extensions of several individual-
level models that we invoked to illuminate the
underlying processes through which the modera-
tion might occur (e.g., Brockner & Wiesenfeld,
1996; Carsten & Spector, 1987; Gerhart, 1990; Lee et
al., 1996; Trevor, 2001; Trevor & Wazeter, 2006).

Although we used some of these individual-level
frameworks to provide distinct rationales for mod-
eration by the procedural justice index and job
embeddedness index, at a very broad level it is also
reasonable to infer a single explanation. The buff-
ering of downsizing’s turnover effects appears to
occur at high levels of HR practices that are gener-
ally considered to reflect well on current employ-
ment, as these practices constrain downsizing-
driven reductions in current employer utility
(albeit in different ways). Research that character-
izes HR on a single dimension could be viewed as
suggesting, in light of this general explanation, that
the greater the degree of, for example, high-involve-
ment practices (e.g., Guthrie, 2001) in an HR sys-
tem, the more protected turnover tendencies will
be from downsizing shocks (see Zatzick and Iver-
son [2006] for a somewhat opposing take on pre-
dicting productivity). This unidimensional HR ap-
proach, however, would not explain the observed
moderation by the career development
index,
which suggests that downsizing triggers a greater
role for the search and signaling benefits from ca-
reer development practices than for any enhanced
current employment utility that these practices
bring. Despite this qualification, formal testing of

unidimensional HR factors in future downsizing
and turnover research would be of value.

Implications for Practice

Although downsizing is sometimes an integral
part of a broader restructuring strategy (Cascio,
2002a), its allure is its potential to quickly yield
substantial savings in employment costs. This
promise, however, can be compromised, at least in
part, by the considerable costs associated with un-
anticipated increases in voluntary turnover. These
costs stem from the inefficiencies associated with
understaffing and from the likely need for subse-
quent hiring and training of replacements to return
an organization’s workforce to its target level. In an
effort to avoid the inefficiency and expense of post-
downsizing turnover, company decision makers
should be mindful of turnover implications when
deciding how many people to cut. Our results sug-
gest that companies can expect a postdownsizing
turnover increase, with the size of this increase
dependent on the levels of job embeddedness, pro-
cedural justice, and career development HR prac-
tices. Being cognizant of these relationships pro-
vides a means for an improved projection of
postdownsizing employment levels and, in turn,
more accurate determination of how much of the
work force needs to be downsized.

An issue potentially more fundamental than how
much to downsize is whether to downsize. It is wise
to consider turnover implications when making this
decision. For example, our marginal effects analysis
predicts, for an average company, a 31 percent in-
crease in postdownsizing voluntary turnover rates
even if just .01 of the workforce is downsized; if an
organization also has low levels of practices that pro-
mote procedural justice and job embeddedness per-
ceptions, the predicted increase in quitting becomes
112 percent. This daunting prediction illustrates how
downsizing strategies in certain contexts may fail,
given understaffing inefficiencies and replacement
costs. Hence, our results not only suggest how HR
practices may mitigate downsizing effects on turn-
over, but also how HR practices may, via turnover
implications, hinder downsizing success. If downsiz-
ing is inevitable, adopting job embeddedness and
procedural justice practices prior to the event could
pay dividends via reducing downsizing’s effect on
turnover. The appropriateness of implementing or
terminating HR practices in a downsizing context, of
course, should be considered in relation to the esti-
mated costs.

Limitations and Future Research

Although our results largely confirmed our hy-
potheses, several limitations to the study are im-
portant to consider. Certainly, external validity is
an important concern. On the one hand, our sample
spans multiple industries, both publicly and pri-
vately held companies, and companies of a wide
variety of sizes. Yet the fact that our entire sample
is made up of relatively admirable, employee-
friendly companies (each seeking a place in
Fortune’s 100 best companies to work for in Amer-
ica) raises the question of whether our findings
tell us anything about downsizing effects in less
employee-friendly places. One might speculate
that, relative to such companies, our main effects
are an overestimate; that is, downsizing in our
employee-friendly organizations might constitute a
more severe breach of an employee’s perceived
psychological contract (Ho, Weingart, & Rousseau,
2004), as job security expectations may be much
higher than in an average company. Alternatively,
the potential for our results to underestimate effects
in a broader population appears to be just as plau-
sible. In our sample of the “best” places to work,
there may have been a layer of employee good will
and trust that buffered the downsizing fallout.
Hence, the downsizings could have been seen as
somewhat justified or unavoidable, with employ-
ees reacting less severely than they might have
without the good will and trust. Similarly, the na-
ture of the overall sample may have restricted the
range of downsizing, HR practices, commitment,
and turnover rates, which would in turn likely
constrain the effect sizes (and generalizability) of
our relationships. Clearly, research on downsizing
effects on turnover in other company populations
would be a welcome addition to our study.

Second, although our data allowed us to make in-
ferences about downsizing and turnover rates, know-
ing exactly who was being downsized and who quit
would add considerably to our findings. We were
unable to examine, for example, the reasonable ex-
pectation that survivors will react more strongly
when they are more similar to downsizing victims.
Relatedly, knowing the job performance levels of
postdownsizing leavers would be instructive, as turn-
over implications change dramatically according to
leaver job performance (e.g., Sturman et al., 2003;
Trevor et al., 1997). Indeed, to the extent that leavers
are easily replaceable by better-performing and/or
less expensive workers, turnover may be desirable
(Dalton, Todor, & Krackhardt, 1982; Hollenbeck &
Williams, 1986; Martin & Bartol, 1985), suggesting a
more positive interpretation of our downsizing ef-
fects. In contrast, any postdownsizing increase in


2008

strong performers’ leaving would be particularly det-
rimental to an organization. Given that high-potential
and high-performing employees enjoy greater mobil-
ity and are the most likely to quit in response to
undesirable circumstances (Trevor, 2001; Trevor et
al., 1997), such an increase is likely. Future research
on exactly who leaves following a downsizing, and
on how context affects the distributional characteris-
tics of this group, would be of great interest to re-
searchers and practitioners.

Third, although companies were instructed to
randomly select employees for the survey from
which we obtained the organizational commitment
measures, we have no actual proof that this was
done. Hence, to the extent that company represen-
tatives, influenced by the wish to be chosen for the
“100 best” list, selectively chose employees to take
the survey, our mediation results may reflect bias.
The safeguards employed by the administrators of
the list likely discouraged self-serving tactics, yet
we cannot dismiss the possibility. Fourth, the tim-
ing of the measures was not ideal. HR practices
were reported in the summer of year t, but turnover
rate was calculated from the summer of year t – 1 to
the summer of year t. This raises simultaneity ques-
tions. The complexity of moderated relationships
may reduce these concerns, as the alternative inter-
pretation of our findings would be that turnover
rate effects on the HR practice indexes depended
on downsizing in a manner that produced results
that correspond to our conceptually grounded hy-
potheses. Although this relationship seems un-
likely, we cannot rule it out. Another factor that
may partially alleviate simultaneity concerns is
that, for the 67 companies in our analyses that
provided surveys in both 1998 and 1999, the re-
ported values for the HR practices remained rela-
tively constant across years; year-to-year correla-
tions averaged .75 for our three HR practice
indexes. Fifth, common method bias is possible in
that the same employee might have provided the
data on number of voluntary leavers, total employ-
ees, downsizing occurrence and timing, and HR
practices. The relatively objective nature of these
questions reduces this concern; so also does the
fact that independently collected organizational
commitment, aggregated to the company level, me-
diated the downsizing–turnover rate relationship
in a manner consistent with our rationale.

Finally, although we controlled for several as-
pects of downsizing context (e.g., restructuring,
early retirement), alternative explanations remain
possible. We were unable to account for whether
companies were repeat downsizers, which may
have shed additional light on our findings. We also
could not control for voluntary buyouts, which

could conceivably have been figured into both the
reported downsizing rate and the number of volun-
tary leavers. This concern, however, is diminished
to the extent that voluntary buyouts covaried with
our early retirement control. Additionally, because
the total number of employees downsized tends to
be considerably smaller than the number of volun-
tary leavers, any double-counting of employees tak-
ing voluntary buyouts likely would have little ef-
fect on the turnover rate measure.

These concerns notwithstanding, we believe that
our study’s evidence of variation in downsizing,
HR practices, turnover rates, and aggregated atti-
tudes is noteworthy. Despite their flaws, the data
provide an unprecedented opportunity to better
understand the turnover ramifications of downsiz-
ing and the HR context.

Conclusion

Evidence is amassing that turnover rates are neg-
atively related to financial performance (e.g.,
Glebbeek & Bax, 2004; Kacmar et al., 2006; McElroy
et al., 2001; Shaw et al., 2005). Thus, business
strategies that affect turnover rates should be exam-
ined very carefully.
In our study, downsizing,
which is designed to reduce costs, predicted greater
turnover rates, which increase costs; moreover, cer-
tain types of HR practices mitigated the downsiz-
ing-turnover relationship, while other HR practices
strengthened it. Hence, it appears that the HR
context has considerable impact on whether and
the extent to which the shock of downsizing ulti-

Perhaps too easily lost in our analysis is the
plight of the downsizing victims. The downsizing-
turnover relationship suggests a sad irony in that
employees are laid off by companies that may sub-
sequently find themselves understaffed. Moreover,
to the extent that turnover hinders organizational
performance, the performance of downsizing com-
panies may well suffer further through the leaving
behavior that the layoffs generate. The formidable
costs to downsizing victims (and perhaps to the
society that absorbs them) may be seen as unavoid-
able in today’s business environment, but this po-
sition is much more palatable when the costs do
not appear to be in vain. Hence, though we ac-
knowledge the frequent necessity of downsizing,
we also emphasize that downsizing wisely is im-
perative. Careful attention to HR practices and the
downsizing-turnover relationship, given the impli-
cations for costs, understaffing, and organizational
performance, appears to be one avenue toward
downsizing wisely.
