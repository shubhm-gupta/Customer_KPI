In this paper, we explore the locus of proﬁtable pollution reduction. We propose that man-

agers underestimate the full value of some means of pollution reduction and so under
exploit these means. Based on evidence from previous studies, we argue that waste pre-
vention often provides unexpected innovation offsets, and that onsite waste treatment often
provides unexpected cost. We use statistical methods to test the direction and signiﬁcance of
the relationship between the various means of pollution reduction and proﬁtability. We ﬁnd
strong evidence that waste prevention leads to ﬁnancial gain, but we ﬁnd no evidence that
ﬁrms proﬁt from reducing pollution by other means. Indeed, we ﬁnd evidence that the ben-
eﬁts of waste prevention alone are responsible for the observed association between lower
emissions and proﬁtability.
(Environmental Strategy; Waste Prevention; Information Economics)

Historically, scholars have argued that discretionary
reductions in pollution by ﬁrms should lead to lower
ﬁnancial performance (Friedman 1970). According to
this view, the cost of pollution is borne by the pub-
lic. Reducing this public harm represents philan-
thropy, not proﬁt maximization. Recently, however,
some scholars have argued that pollution reduction
provides both a public and a private beneﬁt (Hart
1995, Porter and van der Linde 1995, Russo and
Fouts 1997). Reducing pollution may increase pro-
duction efﬁciency,
increase demand from environ-
mentally sensitive consumers, discourage stakeholder
activism, and allow a ﬁrm to attract better workers
(Reinhardt 1999).

The dispute over whether and where it “pays
to be green” is more than simply a debate over
the private cost of pollution: It is a debate about
whether managers systematically miss proﬁt oppor-
tunities. Whatever the private cost of pollution, ratio-
nal managers should choose the level of pollution
that balances the costs and beneﬁts (McWilliams and
Siegel 2001). Beyond this level, additional pollution

reduction should reduce proﬁts. As Palmer et al. (1995)
note, a viable “pays to be green” theory must explain
why “[the private sector] systematically overlooks
proﬁtable opportunities” (p. 91).

Most scholars argue that managers tend to underes-
timate one particular method of pollution reduction—
waste prevention (Majumdar and Marcus 2001,
Klassen and Whybark 1999, Hart 1995, Porter and van
der Linde 1995). They argue that preventing waste (as
opposed to treating waste once produced) provides
unexpected and valuable information about process
improvement opportunities. According to these schol-
ars, such process improvements may more than offset
the cost of pollution reduction (Ashford and Heaton
1983, Porter and van der Linde 1995).

While central to most “pays to be green” argu-
ments, this provocative idea has not been directly
tested. A number of scholars have found evidence
that less-polluting ﬁrms have higher ﬁnancial perfor-
mance (e.g., Hart and Ahuja 1996). Scholars have also
uncovered evidence that waste prevention, in partic-
ular, can provide unexpected learning beneﬁts (King

The Locus of Proﬁtable Pollution Reduction

1995, Klassen and Whybark 1999, Majumdar and
Marcus 2001). In this paper, we disaggregate pollution
reduction into its component factors and jointly test
for the proﬁtability of each factor. We account for
unobserved differences among ﬁrms to determine if
the link between pollution reduction methods and
ﬁnancial performance is real or merely an artifact of
some other ﬁrm attribute. In our analysis, we ﬁnd
support for the “pays to be green” hypothesis, but we
show that this ﬁnding is likely caused by one factor
alone—increased waste prevention.

Theory and Hypotheses
Firms can reduce their pollution in a number of
ways. Firms may reduce their emissions by treating
waste onsite, transferring waste to a third party pro-
cessor, or by preventing waste at the source (often
referred to as source reduction or pollution preven-
tion). A proﬁt-maximizing manager should choose
among these means of pollution reduction so that the
ratio of the marginal productivity of each activity to
the cost of that activity is the same. As a result, for a
proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm, the marginal cost of reducing
a unit of pollution will be the same for all pollution
reduction options and equal to the marginal beneﬁt
of pollution reduction.

However, if information about the value of each
pollution reduction factor is costly to acquire, some
factors may be under exploited while others may
be overused. Theories of information search propose
that prior expectations combined with costly infor-
mation acquisition can cause managers to under (or
over) invest in some forms of process improvement
(Arrow 1974, von Hippel 1994). Absent new infor-
mation, managers’ prior expectations determine the
location and intensity of search for proﬁtable oppor-
tunities (Arrow 1974, Jensen 1982). If managers expect
little beneﬁt from certain pollution reduction strate-
gies, they may not search for such proﬁtable pollution
reduction opportunities, and thus, may not ﬁnd them.
Research has shown that differences in search costs
can inﬂuence the degree to which managers exploit
other production techniques like lean production and
quality management (Ocana and Zemel 1996). Juran
(1988) argues that managers underestimate the value

of total quality management (TQM) because infor-
mation about the value of defect reduction is often
both delayed and obscured (Juran 1988). On the other
hand, the value of catching and ﬁxing defects at the
end of the line is clear (e.g., doing so allows the ﬁrm
to meet customer requirements). As a result, man-
agers often overuse rework departments to ﬁx quality
problems at the end of the line and underuse practices
that improve quality in the production process (Flynn
and Schroeder 1995). Womack et al. (1990) argue that
the difﬁculty of observing the true value of lean pro-
duction and TQM practices delayed their diffusion for
years. During this time, managers who understood
the value of such practices could improve their ﬁrm’s
ﬁnancial performance by improving process quality
and reducing end of line quality control.

Similarly, a number of authors argue that waste
prevention provides hard-to-observe beneﬁts and thus
is underexploited (Hart and Ahuja 1995, Klassen
and Whybark 1999, Russo and Fouts 1997). Waste
prevention requires both conceptual and operational
learning (Larpe et al. 2000). Cebon (1992) argues
that the “contextual embeddedness” of waste pre-
vention makes it difﬁcult for managers to measure
its full value. King (1999) ﬁnds that while waste
prevention improves worker incentives and encour-
ages development of worker skills, these beneﬁts
are often overlooked. Hart (1995) argues the beneﬁts
of waste prevention are distributed and thus difﬁ-
cult to attribute to waste prevention. Other scholars
argue that unexpected synergies may exist between
waste prevention and lean production techniques
(Rothenberg 1999, King and Lenox 2001).

Increased process innovation is often cited as an
example of unexpected beneﬁt from waste preven-
tion (Porter and van der Linde 1995). Ashford and
Heaton (1983) argue that managers often overlook the
abundant innovations from waste prevention. Berube
et al. (1992) provide an explanation for this oversight.
They argue that waste prevention allows improved
measurement of the production process, and thereby
facilitates process innovation. They describe one strik-
ing example where mandated waste prevention led to
numerous unexpected and highly proﬁtable process-
improving innovations. King (1995) shows that, in
industry, pollution prevention

activities contributed a disproportionate number of
process-improving innovations. Porter and van der
Linde (1995) argue that these innovation offsets are
often hard to link to their source, and thus, managers
underestimate the value of the underlying process
that engendered them. If managers do not factor in
the value of such innovation, they will underinvest in
waste prevention, and those ﬁrms that increase their
investment in such activities will improve their ﬁnan-
cial performance.

Hypothesis 1. The more a ﬁrm prevents waste, the

higher its ﬁnancial performance.

While waste prevention may provide unexpected
beneﬁts, several scholars have argued that waste
treatment activities often entail unexpected costs
(Cebon 1992, Hart 1995). The idea that end-of-
pipe treatment might entail hidden costs derives
from Thompson’s (1967) argument that organizational
buffers both insulate the ﬁrm from disturbances and
reduce the information ﬂowing to managers. Cebon
(1992) extends this argument by suggesting that waste
treatment activities reduce the incentives to improve
the production process. Waste-processing operations
allow the ﬁrm to continue to engage in sloppy prac-
tices and then clean up the resulting problems “at the
end of the pipe” (Cebon 1992, Hart 1995). King (1999)
ﬁnds evidence that managers in one industry system-
atically overinvested in waste treatment activities and
that reduction in the size and capacity of these end-of-
pipe operations encouraged waste treatment person-
nel to improve the process itself. If managers overlook
the hidden cost of waste treatment, they will choose
to do more onsite waste treatment than is economical.

Hypothesis 2. The less a ﬁrm treats waste onsite, the

higher its ﬁnancial performance.

Data and Measures
Our sample is drawn from publicly traded U.S. man-
ufacturing ﬁrms that are both listed in the Compus-
tat database and have at least one facility that meets
the reporting requirements of the U.S. EPA’s Toxic
Release Inventory (TRI). Facilities must complete TRI
reports if they manufacture or process 25,000 pounds
of any listed chemical during a calendar year, use

more than 10,000 pounds, and employ 10 or more
full-time people. Prior to 1991, ﬁrms did not pro-
vide detailed information about waste generation or
waste-processing onsite, thus we cannot use data
from the years 1987–1990. At the initiation of this
paper, 1996 was the last year of reported data. By
matching the two sets, we created an unbalanced sam-
ple of 614 ﬁrms constituting 2,837 ﬁrm-year observa-
tions for the years 1991–1996.

Financial Performance
We measure ﬁnancial performance in two ways:
return on assets (ROA) and Tobin’s q. ROA is a stan-
dard accounting measure of ﬁnancial performance
found commonly in strategy research. ROA is calcu-
lated by dividing earnings before interest by average
total ﬁrm assets. We use Tobin’s q in addition to ROA,
because Tobin’s q better reﬂects the inherent value
of the ﬁrm. Tobin’s q reﬂects expected future gains
and is in accordance with more recent “pays to be
green” studies (see Dowell et al. 2000). We calculated
Tobin’s q by dividing the sum of ﬁrm equity value,
book value of long-term debt, and net current liabil-
ities by total assets (see Chung and Pruitt 1995). We
do not use the more complicated measure of Tobin’s q
as proposed by Lindenberg and Ross (1981), because
past research has found little qualitative difference
between this measure and the simpliﬁed version used
in this analysis (Chung and Pruitt 1995).

Pollution Reduction
Previous research has measured ﬁrm pollution by
dividing annual ﬁrm emissions of toxic chemicals by
ﬁrm size (Hart and Ahuja 1996). We improve on this
measure by analyzing performance at the facility level
and by separating out the various means of pollution
reduction. By comparing performance at the facility
level, we can better control for industry effects. By dis-
tinguishing among waste prevention and onsite and
offsite waste treatment, we can explore where proﬁt
opportunities lie.

To measure each facility’s emissions, we sum
releases of the 246 “core” toxic chemicals that have
been consistently reported in the U.S. EPA’s Toxic
Release Inventory. We weigh each chemical by its tox-
icity using the Reportable Quantities (RQ) list in the

CERCLA statute (cf., King and Lenox 2000). To mea-
sure the ﬁrm’s total pollution, we create a ﬁrm-level
variable (total emissions) by taking the natural log of
the total toxicity weighted emissions across all of a
ﬁrm’s facilities.

Total emissions are the outcome of a ﬁrm’s waste
generation and its efforts to reduce this waste by
prevention and treatment. Creating measures of each
of these requires several steps. We ﬁrst measure the
total toxic waste generated at a facility in a given
year by calculating the toxicity-weighted sum of all
core chemicals released into the environment, treated
onsite, and transferred offsite. Next, we estimate a
quadratic function between facility size and total
waste generation for each 4-digit Standard Industry
Classiﬁcation (SIC) code within each year using stan-
dard OLS regression.

ln Wit = (cid:6)jt + (cid:9)1jt(cid:10)ln sit(cid:11)+ (cid:9)2jt(cid:10)ln sit(cid:11)2 + (cid:12)jt(cid:13)

where Wit is aggregate waste generated for facility i
in year t, sit is facility size, (cid:6)jt, (cid:9)1jt, and (cid:9)2jt are the
estimated coefﬁcients for sector j in year t, and (cid:12)jt is
the residual.

We use the estimated function to predict

the
amount of waste each facility would generate given
its size, industry, and year. We use the residual to
measure the relative performance of each facility in
reducing this waste generation.

where W ∗
it is predicted waste generation for facility
i in year t, RWit is the standardized relative perfor-
mance for facility i in year t, and (cid:17)(cid:12)jt
is the standard
error of the residual for the SIC and year pair. We use
the exponential form of the equation because we wish
to sum these estimates for all facilities in ﬁrm before
taking the log. We standardize the residuals to reﬂect
the relative conﬁdence of different estimations and we
change the sign of the residual so that positive scores
indicate more waste prevention. Unweighted aggre-
gations and nonstandardized residuals deliver similar
results.

Our ﬁnancial performance measures are at the cor-
porate level, so we must aggregate our facility level
data up to the company level. Waste generation is
calculated as the sum of predicted waste generation
(W ∗
it) across all facilities owned by a ﬁrm. Essentially,
this is our best guess for how much waste the com-
pany would have generated if it were an average per-
former for its size in its industry. Waste prevention is
the weighted average of a ﬁrm’s facility-level scores
(RWit) based on the percentage of total production
that each facility represents for the company.

We also construct measures of relative waste treat-
ment. We ﬁrst calculate the ratio of the material
treated onsite (e.g., treated, burned, or recycled) to
the total waste generated. We then calculate the aver-
age and standard deviations for these amounts for
each SIC code in each year. From this, we calculate a
deviation for each facility. These deviations are then
summed to form a ﬁrm measure of onsite manage-
ment (waste treatment). Similarly, waste transfer mea-
sures the percentage of waste that is processed offsite
and is calculated in the same way.

Controls
We include a number of measures commonly used in
the analysis of ﬁnancial performance as controls (e.g.,
Berger and Ofek 1995). A company’s size (ﬁrm size)
is calculated as the log of the company’s assets. The
amount a ﬁrm is growing (growth) is calculated as the
annual percent change in sales. The capital intensity
(capital intensity) of the ﬁrm is calculated by dividing
capital expenditures by sales. The degree to which the
ﬁrm is leveraged (leverage) is expressed as the ratio of
its debt to assets. Finally, the research and develop-
ment intensity of the ﬁrm (R&D intensity) is calculated
by dividing research and development expenses by
total assets.

In addition to these common ﬁnancial controls, we
also include an estimate of a ﬁrm’s labor prices in our
regressions (regional wages). Because employees were
used as a proxy for facility level production, differ-
ences in labor efﬁciency among the ﬁrms in our study
might bias our analysis. Lower labor prices would
encourage managers to substitute labor for waste. For
example, managers could hire workers to search for
problems, engage in maintenance, or improve existing

Finally, environmental

processes. These lower labor prices would also reduce
the marginal cost of production and increase proﬁts.
To rule out this rival explanation, we gathered infor-
mation on annual state-level labor prices for unskilled
labor from the county business pattern database of the
U.S. Census Department. We create our measure by
calculating the weighted average of state labor prices
of all the states in which a ﬁrm has facilities operating.
regulation varies across
regions and imposes greater or lesser penalties for
pollution. We measure a state’s regulatory stringency
by calculating the inverse of the log of state toxic
emissions divided by total employees in four main
polluting industries: chemicals, petroleum, pulp and
paper, and materials processing (Meyer 1995). We cre-
ate a ﬁrm-level measure, regulatory stringency, by cal-
culating the weighted average of the state regulatory
stringency of all the states in which a ﬁrm has facil-
ities operating. We created an alternative measure of
regulatory stringency, permits, by summing the num-
ber of federal waste water and hazardous waste per-
mits possessed by a ﬁrm.

In Table 1, we present summary statistics for each
of our measures. In Table 2, we present the pairwise
correlation matrix for our measures. Please note that
the sample is smaller for ROA than for Tobin’s q.
This is primarily a result of missing data on ﬁrm
income levels. Misreported data caused elimination of

29 observations where ROA was more than ﬁve stan-
dard deviations away from the mean.

Analysis and Results
We hypothesize that some types of pollution reduc-
tion activities directly affect a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per-
formance. However,
it is possible that other ﬁrm
attributes
jointly affect both a ﬁrm’s pollution
reduction activities and its ﬁnancial performance
(Christmann 2000). It is difﬁcult to include all of
the possibly confounding ﬁrm attributes in statis-
tical analysis; we use a ﬁxed-effects regression to
account for unobserved differences among our ﬁrms
that might truly explain ﬁnancial performance. The
ﬁxed-effect speciﬁcation allows each ﬁrm to have a
separate intercept and, thus, has the attractive prop-
erty that it controls for stable ﬁrm attributes like the
date of ﬁrm founding. In essence, a ﬁxed-effect regres-
sion requires that changes in independent variables
(rather than their baseline level) be associated with
changes in dependent variables. Fixed effects, along
with our use of lagged dependent variables, allow
us to argue that changes in our independent vari-
ables are associated with and precede changes in our
dependent variables.

We estimate a number of models over the entire
panel controlling for both ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects

(see Table 3). In Models 1 and 2, we ﬁnd that lower
emissions (total emissions) are signiﬁcantly associated
with higher ﬁnancial performance as measured by
future Tobin’s q and future ROA. We therefore cor-
roborate Hart and Ahuja’s (1996) ﬁnding that reduced
emissions are correlated with future ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. Our ﬁndings are consistent with the general
ﬁndings of the empirical “pays to be green” literature
(e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997, Klassen and Whybark
1999, Cohen et al. 2000).

Next, we explore by what means such reductions
occurred (see Table 3). To explore the locus of prof-
itable pollution reduction, we disaggregate pollution
reduction into its component parts (waste generation,
waste prevention, waste treatment, and waste transfer).
In combination, these separate measures explain over
90% of total emissions. Regressing these measures on
future Tobin’s q, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant, positive rela-
tionship with waste prevention (Model 3). We also ﬁnd
a signiﬁcant, positive relationship between waste pre-
vention and future ROA (Model 4). We ﬁnd no evi-
dence in either model that onsite waste treatment
or offsite transfer is associated with ﬁnancial perfor-
mance.

Our ﬁxed-effects analysis helps reduce the effect
of unobserved heterogeneity, but it does not demon-
strate the direction of causality. For example, man-
agers may invest in waste prevention when they

have an unusually proﬁtable year. We extend our
analysis by performing a test for Granger causal-
ity (see Table 4). Granger causality may be inferred
when the lagged dependent variable is included in a
regression and the independent variables continue to
have explanatory power (Greene 1993, Granger 1969).
In Model 5, we ﬁnd a moderately signiﬁcant posi-
tive relationship between waste prevention and future
Tobin’s q in a model that includes Tobin’s q as a
regressor. In Model 6, we also ﬁnd a moderately
signiﬁcant relationship between waste prevention and
future ROA when including current ROA as a regres-
sor.1 Thus, we ﬁnd support for Hypothesis 1. We note,
however, that this more stringent model reduced the
signiﬁcance of our waste prevention coefﬁcient esti-
mates (from p < 0(cid:20)028 to p < 0(cid:20)05 in Table 3). This may
be due to the reduction in our sample size as a result
of including additional lagged variables.

Models 7 and 8 explore the extent to which our
measure of waste prevention explains the observed

1 Please note that in Models 5 and 6, we use an instrumental vari-
ables approach proposed by Anderson and Hsiao (1982) to correct
for potential serial correlation that may arise because of the lagged
dependent variable. In this approach, heterogeneity is reduced by
taking ﬁrst differences (Greene 1993). Two-year lagged values of the
dependent variable are used as instruments. We also tested an alter-
native method proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and found
consistent results.

relationship between total emissions and ﬁnancial per-
formance (see Table 4). Since total emissions is the out-
come of different pollution reduction measures, we
use a two-stage-least squares (2SLS) speciﬁcation to
compare the relative effect of emissions versus waste
prevention on proﬁtability. We ﬁrst estimate total emis-
sions as a function of waste generation, prevention,
treatment, and transfer. We then estimate the effect
of total emissions, waste prevention, and our control

variables on ﬁnancial performance. The ﬁrst stage
of the model predicts total releases based on opera-
tional choices and industry. The second stage predicts
proﬁts based on both releases and waste prevention.
As shown in Models 7 and 8, we ﬁnd evidence that
more waste prevention is associated with Tobin’s q and
ROA, respectively. Controlling for the effect of waste
prevention, we ﬁnd no evidence that pollution (total
emissions) is associated with ﬁnancial performance. In

other words, we ﬁnd evidence that reducing pollution
by preventing waste is proﬁtable but have no evidence
that reducing pollution by other means is proﬁtable.

Discussion
In general, our analysis supports the “pays to be
green” hypothesis. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant, negative

relationship between ﬁrm emissions and ﬁnancial
performance. More importantly, we show that ﬁrms
underexploit one means of reducing pollution—waste
prevention. We ﬁnd no evidence that managers
underexploit other factors, or pollution reduction in
total. Indeed, we ﬁnd evidence that the beneﬁts of
waste prevention alone may be responsible for the
association between lower emissions and proﬁtability.

KING AND LENOX

The Locus of Proﬁtable Pollution Reduction

While our analysis covers many industries and a
time period of six years, there are reasons to be
cautious about the generalizability of our ﬁndings.
The U.S. regulatory environment is a rather unique
one. Compared to European and Asian nations, U.S.
regulators are less conciliatory. In countries with a
more cooperative relationship between government
and industry, managers may be more likely to explore
the beneﬁts of pollution prevention and less likely to
miss opportunities for proﬁtable pollution prevention.
We hope that future research will test our ﬁndings in
different institutional and regulatory environments.

While we infer from our ﬁndings that managers
underexploit opportunities for proﬁtable waste pre-
vention, other rival hypotheses cannot be completely
ruled out. We would ﬁnd similar results if (1) man-
agers tend to invest in pollution prevention only
when they already possess other valuable ﬁrm capa-
bilities, and (2) the market does not fully value these
other capabilities until they observe the ﬁrm pre-
venting waste. If so, pollution prevention might act
only as an indicator of existing underlying capabili-
ties (Morrison and Siegel 1997). Pollution prevention
may be part of a moving technological frontier and
ﬁrms only jump to this frontier when it is in their
interest to do so. Jumping to the new frontier then
provides information to the market about the ﬁrm’s
capabilities.

Within this rival theory, our explanation may still
have merit. Search costs and prior expectations may
inﬂuence the valuation that managers place on reach-
ing the new frontier. Alternatively, it may be that pol-
lution prevention is often part of a bundle of activ-
ities that are deployed together. For example, lean
production and waste prevention may frequently be
deployed together—making it difﬁcult to untangle
the ﬁnancial effects of the entire bundle.2 Waste pre-
vention may represent the observed part of a bun-
dle of complementary activities that provide ﬁnancial
gain. Such an analysis represents only a short walk
from our claim that waste prevention provides hidden

2 To try to distinguish this particular bundle, we also estimated each
ﬁrm’s participation in the ISO 9,000 quality standard and their max-
imum inventory levels for listed chemicals. We found that inclusion
of these variables did not change the signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings.

ancillary beneﬁts. Nevertheless, we should be cau-
tious in not overextending our ﬁndings. It is possible
that a combination of fortuitous resources and man-
agerial choice could cause the statistical results we
observe.

It is important to recognize that we do not directly
measure what managers know or what manager’s
expect to be the cost of identifying proﬁt opportu-
nities. We infer these search costs and expectations
by evaluating the use of pollution reduction factors.
While we try to rule out other rival explanations for
our observed results, our inability to actually measure
expectations and search costs suggests the need for
additional work at multiple levels of analysis.

Conclusions
The dispute over whether it “pays to be green” is
more than simply a debate over the private cost of
pollution. It is a debate about whether and when
managers systematically miss proﬁt opportunities.
Drawing upon theories of information search, we pro-
pose that prior expectations combined with costly
information acquisition can cause managers to under-
exploit (or overexploit) some process factors and thus
miss potential proﬁt opportunities. Lacking informa-
tion on the locus of proﬁt opportunities, managers’
prior expectations may determine the location and
intensity of search (Arrow 1974, Jensen 1982).

In this study, we extend the “pays to be green” lit-
erature by distinguishing among methods for reduc-
ing emissions. We argue that the value of one method
(pollution prevention) is hard to observe, while the
cost of another (end-of-pipe waste treatment) is often
obscured. As a result, we hypothesize that managers
underexploit waste prevention and overexploit waste
treatment. In a longitudinal analysis of U.S. manufac-
turing ﬁrms, we ﬁnd evidence that waste prevention
is indeed underused, and that ﬁrms can improve their
ﬁnancial performance by engaging in more waste pre-
vention.

Our analysis reinforces the similarity between the-
ories of waste prevention and quality. We extend
theories developed to explain the effect of quality
programs to argue that managers underestimate the
beneﬁt of solving waste problems at their source. We

ﬁnd evidence that this tendency does exist and that
ﬁrms can reap proﬁts by further investing in waste
prevention. More generally, we provide a frame-
work for predicting when such proﬁt opportuni-
ties are likely to go underexploited. We propose
that costly information acquisition and prior expec-
tations can determine where opportunities for prof-
itable improvements go unexploited.

In this paper, we propose that ﬁrms sometimes fail
to adopt proﬁtable practices. One may be tempted
to conclude from our analysis that government reg-
ulation is needed to correct such market failure. This
need not be the case. Governing authorities may
gather information and provide statistics to managers
to update their expectations about the proﬁtability
of engaging in certain practices (Lenox 1999). In the
environmental realm, the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency has created a number of programs to
inform businesses of the value of energy efﬁciency
and waste minimization and to help them ﬁnd these
opportunities (e.g., the Green Lights Program). Trade
associations often try to provide such information
to their member ﬁrms (King and Lenox 2000). Our
research extends analysis of whether and when such
programs are likely to be useful. In future research,
we hope to further explore these types of information
provision programs.
