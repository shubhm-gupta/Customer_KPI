 INSTITUTIONAL OWNERS AND CORPORATE

 SOCIAL PERFORMANCE

 SAMUEL B. GRAVES
 SANDRA A. WADDOCK
 Boston College

 In this study, we hypothesize that institutions invest more heavily in
 companies with strong corporate social performance. Analysis indi-
 cated a significant, positive relationship between social performance
 and the number of institutions holding the shares of a company and a
 positive but insignificant relationship between social performance and
 the percentage of shares held by institutions. We conclude that improv-
 ing a company's corporate social performance invokes no penalty in
 institutional ownership.

 In recent years, the growth in the stock holdings of institutional owners,

 such as pension funds and mutual funds, has been substantial. In the com-
 puter industry, institutional ownership grew from 16 percent of common
 equity in 1976 to almost 50 percent in 1984. In the chemical industry, it grew
 from 15 to 52 percent in the same period (Graves & Waddock, 1990). For
 some firms, the level of institutional ownership is much higher. In mid-
 1991, institutions held 73 percent of the shares of Federal Express, 74 per-
 cent of Motorola, 76 percent of Lotus Development, and 79 percent of Aetna
 Life & Casualty (Standard & Poor's, 1991). From these data it is clear that
 corporate managers must take into account the concerns of institutional
 owners if their company's stock is to be attractive to a large and growing
 segment of the financial market.

 This study was designed to examine the relationship between institu-

 tional ownership and corporate social performance (CSP) in firms. Specifi-
 cally, we asked, Does a high level of CSP lead to an increase in institutional
 ownership? We constructed a new index that aggregates eight different at-
 tributes of CSP and then determined whether high values on this index
 tended to be linked to high levels of institutional ownership. This is the first
 study to use such a comprehensive index of corporate social performance.

 We wish to thank Steven D. Lydenberg of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc., for his

 assistance with the data and the anonymous referees of this journal for many helpful sugges-
 tions.

 Theory

 BACKGROUND

 According to myopic institutions theory (Hansen & Hill, 1991), institu-
 tional owners tend to be more shortsighted than individual investors. This
 shortsightedness occurs, ex hypothesi, because institutional money manag-
 ers must compete for accounts and are reviewed and rewarded on the basis
 of annual or even quarterly performance. Accordingly, it is assumed that
 their investment decisions will be based on the same short time horizons
 (Woolridge, 1988). The theory is relevant to our study because investments
 in corporate social performance tend to be long-term (Mahapatra, 1984), and
 so there may be an incompatibility between an institutional owner's time
 horizon and the time needed to realize the benefits from a commitment to
 CSP.

 Another theoretical question is the relationship between corporate so-
 cial performance and investment risk. Spicer (1978), for example, argued
 that institutional investors consider low-CSP firms to be riskier investments,
 and his results supported this thesis. This risk arises, inter alia, from the
 possibility of costly sanctions resulting from adverse legislative or regulatory
 actions, judicial decisions, or consumer retaliation. The likelihood of such
 actions then leads investors to revise their perceptions of the probability
 distribution of future costs and revenues (Shane & Spicer, 1983). Spicer cited
 survey data that showed "a seemingly widespread view within the invest-
 ment community that a moderate to strong association does exist" (1978: 96)
 between the risk of a corporation and its attention to issues of social respon-
 sibility and noted that, in terms of the theory of finance, an investment in a
 company that is socially irresponsible could be inefficient. By choosing a
 similar but socially responsible company, an investor might achieve the
 same return with less risk. Investors are assumed to consider both risk and
 the return, and high social responsibility may reduce risk, thus providing an
 incentive for company managers to invest in positive CSP measures.

 According to efficient market theory (Fama, 1970), institutional inves-

 tors consider both of the above arguments when determining the appropriate
 risk-adjusted discount rate to use in discounting future cash flows.1 Myopic
 institutional behavior is related to the discount rate, and interpretation of
 CSP as a risk-reducing measure is related to risk adjustment. Efficient market
 theory suggests that investors consider the effect of publicly available infor-
 mation on both future cash flow and investment risk simultaneously. If a
 firm makes a major social performance investment-in, say, pollution con-
 trol-that reduces cash flow but does not reduce risk, the present value of all
 future cash flows will be reduced and the stock may be sold in accordance
 with the predictions of myopic institutions theory. If, on the other hand, a

 the investor's preference for current over future income.

 firm makes the same investment but reduces the probability of adverse legal
 or regulatory action through CSP enhancement so that the risk-adjusted dis-
 count rate falls, then it is possible that the decline in the discount rate could
 more than compensate for the drop in cash flow, making the stock more
 attractive to investors. On balance, then, to predict the effect of a CSP-
 enhancing commitment by a firm, an investigator needs to know the effects
 of the measure on both cash flow and risk. To the extent that the performance
 of firms is comparable, however, institutional investors will tend to choose
 less risky stocks from firms with strong social performance.

 Empirical Work

 Several empirical studies have examined predictions based on myopic
 institutions theory (Baysinger, Kosnik, & Turk, 1991; Graves, 1988, 1990;
 Hansen & Hill, 1991). Only Graves (1988) found support for the theory; the
 findings of the others contradicted it. The last two works, both large-scale,
 multiple-industry studies, are especially compelling, and so the main body
 of empirical work seems to refute the myopic institutions hypothesis. The
 theory may have proved unsupportable because of changes in the scale of
 institutional shareholdings since the mid-1980s. Institutional holdings have
 increased to the point that institutions can no longer move quickly out of a
 stock that has lost favor; thus, these investors have become longer-term
 holders by necessity, and many have become actively involved in the gov-
 ernance of companies that they own. From these results we concluded that
 the argument for a short time horizon among institutional investors is no
 longer supported and therefore did not use this theory as a basis for our
 hypothesis.

 Teoh and Shiu (1990) examined the attitudes of institutional owners

 toward corporate social performance and sources of information about it.
 They found that institutional investors did not normally alter their invest-
 ment decisions on the basis of company assertions about CSP contained in
 conventional financial information, such as annual reports. However, insti-
 tutional investors took CSP information into account if it was quantified,
 focused on specific issues, and obtained from disinterested parties. Further,
 the work of Heiner (1983) suggested that institutional investors were more
 able than individual investors to assimilate and act upon information about
 socially responsible corporate practices.

 Coffey and Fryxell (1991), in the only published study specifically ad-
 dressing the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate so-
 cial performance, found, to their surprise, a negative association between
 compliance with the Sullivan Principles2 and institutional ownership. They
 found no significant relationship between corporate charitable giving and
 institutional ownership but discovered a significant, positive relationship

 between the number of women on a board of directors and institutional
 ownership. Their mixed findings may be explained by the structure of their
 study, which did not control for profit, company size, or industry; any of
 these variables could have confounded the estimations. And since the study
 was purely cross-sectional in design, no inference could be made about the
 direction of causation. Thus, although this study, as the first of its kind, is a
 valuable contribution to the literature, it is not definitive and seems to leave
 unresolved the true relationship between corporate social performance and
 institutional ownership.

 Little empirical work has been done on the question of institutional risk
 aversion. Chaganti and Damanpour (1991) found a negative association be-
 tween stock ownership by institutional investors and firms' debt-to-capital
 ratios, supporting the proposition that institutional investors are risk-averse.
 We generalized from that traditional financial risk aversion, interpreting
 increased CSP as a risk-reducing measure and assuming that, ceteris paribus,
 institutional investors will view high social performance favorably.

 Hypothesis

 Our view of CSP as a risk-reducing measure, together with the predic-
 tions of efficient market theory that a rational investor, choosing between
 two companies with the same expected return, will select the one with less
 risk, led to the following:

 Hypothesis 1: Improvements in a company's corporate
 social performance will increase institutional ownership.

 The model we used to examine this hypothesis was IOt = f(CSPt_1, control
 variablest-i), where IO is a measure of institutional ownership, CSP is a
 measure of corporate social performance, and t is time.

 Data

 METHODS

 This study is based on a group of companies from the Standard & Poor's

 500. Missing or unusable institutional ownership or CSP data reduced the
 data set from 500 to 453 firms. Missing financial data further reduced it to
 430 firms.

 Dependent Variables

 The primary focus of this research was the behavior of institutional
 owners with respect to corporate social performance. Institutional owner-
 ship was measured in two ways: (1) as the number of institutions that held
 shares in each company and (2) as the percentage of each company's out-
 standing shares owned by institutions. Institutional ownership data were
 taken from Standard & Poor's Stock Guides for mid-1991.

 Independent Variables

 Our independent variables included corporate social performance, our
 primary focus, and firm profitability, size, debt level, and industry as control
 variables. We used 1990 data for each of these variables, providing a one-
 year lag between the measurement of the independent and dependent vari-
 ables.

 Corporate social performance. Corporate social performance is notori-
 ously difficult to measure consistently (Aupperle, 1991; Aupperle, Carroll, &
 Hatfield, 1985; Gephart, 1991; Miles, 1987; Wolfe & Aupperle, 1991; Wood,
 1991). Previous researchers have attempted to measure CSP in a variety of
 ways, including using forced-choice surveys (Aupperle, 1991; Aupperle et
 al., 1985), the Fortune reputational and social responsibility index
 (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), content analysis of documents
 (Wolfe, 1991), behavioral and perceptual measures (Wokutch & McKinney,
 1991), and case study methodologies (Clarkson, 1991).

 Each of these techniques has limitations. Survey methods have prob-
 lems relating to return rates and consistency among raters. The Fortune
 ratings have been criticized as being as much a measure of overall corporate
 financial performance as of corporate social performance. Document analy-
 sis depends upon the comprehensiveness of and the purposes for which the
 documents were originally created. Behavioral and perceptual measures po-
 tentially suffer from respondent bias and inconsistency. Case study methods
 also suffer from both inconsistency and lack of generalizability.

 To overcome these problems, corporate social performance should be

 uniformly measured across a wide range of companies and for a consistent
 range of important social issues. The independent variable used in this study
 was an index of CSP that we considered to satisfy these requirements. We
 generated this index, which gives a single numerical CSP value for each
 company in an analysis, from data developed by Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini
 & Co., Inc. (KLD), a financial advisory firm specializing in the assessment of
 CSP.

 KLD assesses companies on eight attributes of CSP, providing a multi-
 dimensional appraisal of their social behavior. These eight attributes con-
 cern community relations, employee relations, environment, product, treat-
 ment of women and minorities, military contracts, nuclear power, and South
 Africa. For each of the first five attributes, KLD rates a company using a
 five-step scale ranging from "major strength" to "major weakness." We con-
 verted these ratings to numerical values, with +2 representing a major
 strength and - 2 representing a major weakness. For the last three attributes,
 KLD assesses only weaknesses. Thus, after our conversions, these three at-
 tributes had values of -2, -1, or 0. Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini rates
 each company on each of the eight attributes by referring to a consistent,
 largely objective, set of screening criteria (Kinder, Lydenberg, & Domini,
 1990).

 The assessment scheme used by KLD offers several benefits over rating

 mechanisms used in previous studies: (1) It rates each company on multiple
 attributes considered important to social performance. (2) Because one
 group is doing the ratings, using an objective set of screening criteria, the
 ratings are applied consistently across all companies and are replicable. (3)
 Because KLD operates a service that supplies information to the investment
 community at large, it rates all of the Standard & Poor's 500 firms. (4) The
 group doing the rating consists of knowledgeable individuals not affiliated
 with any of the rated companies or with researchers performing studies.
 Thus, this firm's scaling process provides unique access to a wide range of
 consistently rated firms across a number of important social performance
 attributes.

 One limitation of the KLD data is that all attributes are essentially given
 equal importance, whereas most observers of corporate social performance
 consider some areas more important than others. To deal with this issue, we
 used weights developed by Ruf, Muralidhar, and Paul (1993) to compute a
 weighted average across the eight attribute ratings for each company in the
 study. This process resulted in a single-value CSP index for each company
 ranging from -2.0, for companies rated lowest on all eight attributes, to
 + 1.66, for those rated highest on all eight.

 Control variables and analysis. Some differences in institutional own-
 ership may result from firm profitability, size, debt level, and industry. We
 therefore controlled for each of these variables to isolate the unique contri-
 bution of CSP to investment decisions.

 Firm profitability was measured by return on assets and return on eq-

 uity. Size was measured by total assets and total sales. Debt level was mea-
 sured as the ratio of total long-term debt to total assets. All financial data
 were taken from COMPUSTAT tapes for 1990. Industries were broken down
 by four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and represented
 in our model by dummy variables.

 We used regression analyses to test our hypotheses, employing the two
 measures of institutional ownership as the dependent variable and control-
 ling for profit, size, debt level, and industry.

 Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analysis

 RESULTS

 Table 1 shows that, on average, institutions owned about 56 percent of

 the equity in the studied firms. There is considerable variance in this figure,
 however, from a low of 7.8 percent to a high of 90.7 percent. The average
 number of institutions holding shares in the companies was about 345, with
 a minimum of 26 and a maximum of 1,429.

 Average sales for the companies in our data set were about $6.9 billion,

 with average assets about $12 billion. Average return on equity (ROE) was
 about 13 percent for the group, return on assets (ROA) about 5 percent, and
 the ratio of debt to total assets, about 20 percent.

 The debt-to-asset ratio is significantly correlated with both assets and

 return on assets for the firms. This multicollinearity caused the estimated
 regression coefficient of the debt-to-asset ratio to be insignificant when en-
 tered as an explanatory variable in the presence of the other two variables.
 There was also a low correlation between the two measures of institutional
 ownership, indicating that an increase in the number of institutions holding
 a firm's stock does not necessarily lead to an increase in the number of shares
 held by institutions.
 Regression Analysis

 All the regression models calculated used institutional ownership as the

 dependent variable. In the first three models, number of institutions holding
 shares in a company was the proxy for institutional ownership; in the second
 three models, the percentage of a company's shares owned by institutions
 represented institutional ownership. In all models, the corporate social per-
 formance index was the principal independent variable. In all equations,
 size, financial performance, debt-to-asset ratio, and industry (omitted from
 the table for space reasons) were control variables. We also included the
 squares of sales and assets because, controlling for other variables, we found
 that the number of institutions owning a company's stock showed a qua-
 dratic relationship with company size.

 In the first model, ROE is the proxy for financial performance, and assets
 the proxy for size. As the results in Table 2 show, in this model there is a
 significant and positive relationship (p < .001) between corporate social
 performance and institutional ownership when other factors are held con-
 stant. For model 1, the multiple coefficient of determination (R2) is .46. The
 R2 for the industry dummy variables alone was .11.

 Results for the second and third models were similar. These differ from

 the first only in the profitability and size proxies used. In model 2, sales
 replace assets. Corporate social performance is still significantly related to
 institutional ownership (p < .001), and the explanatory power of the model
 increases somewhat. In model 3, where we used ROA to control for financial
 performance and assets to control for size, the relationship between CSP and
 institutional ownership is still significant (p < .01), although somewhat less
 so. The results from all three of these models provide strong support for our
 hypothesis, which postulated that high CSP values would result in high
 levels of institutional ownership. All three models explain at least 46 per-
 cent of the variance in institutional ownership.

 The results obtained with use of our control variables are plausible and

 reasonable. A significant and positive relationship between firm financial
 performance and institutional ownership emerged from our analyses, sug-
 gesting that, as we expected, strong financial performance leads to increases
 in institutional ownership, with other variables held constant. There was a
 negative relationship between the debt-to-asset ratio and institutional own-
 ership. This relationship is significant in all but the third model, where
 multicollinearity (noted above regarding the correlation table) reduces its
 significance. From this pattern of results, we concluded that, ceteris paribus,

 institutional investors prefer firms with low debt ratios, suggesting that in-
 stitutions are risk-averse. With respect to firm size, the quadratic relation-
 ship we observed suggested that, other things being equal, institutional in-
 vestors prefer large firms, but that, when firms pass some size threshold,
 those investors view them less favorably.

 The results of the models that used the percentage of shares institution-
 ally owned as the dependent variable (models 4, 5, and 6, Table 3) were
 largely insignificant. These models show a positive relationship between
 corporate social performance and the percentage of shares owned by insti-
 tutions, but it is not significant in any of the three. Firm financial perfor-
 mance and size are also insignificant. The debt-to-asset ratio is significant in
 models 4 and 5, paralleling the results of models 1 and 2 and again indicat-
 ing risk aversion on the part of institutional owners.

 DISCUSSION

 Quite clearly, our results indicate that a company incurs no penalty in

 terms of its attractiveness to institutional investors for improvements in CSP
 ratings, and indeed, the first set of equations clearly suggests that institu-
 tions respond favorably to such improvements. There is some consistency
 between our results and those of Coffey and Fryxell (1991), who found a
 significant and positive relationship between the number of women on a
 board of directors and institutional ownership level, and also consistency

 with the findings of Teoh and Shiu (1990), who concluded from survey data
 that institutional investors would take CSP information into account if they
 saw it as objective and reliable. In recent years, there has been a rapid
 increase in socially responsible investing and in the information about com-
 panies' CSP records that is available (Social Investment Forum, 1993;
 Warner, 1990). Our results, which are consistent with the predictions of
 Coffee and Fryxell (1991), suggest that institutional investors are taking this
 information into account in deciding whether or not to own stock in a given
 firm.

 The results of our study are consistent with a steadily accumulating
 body of evidence that provides little support for the myopic institutions
 theory. Our study indicates that there is no penalty for improved corporate
 social performance in terms of institutional ownership generally and that
 high CSP tends in fact to lead to an increase in the number of institutions
 holding a given stock.

 Improved corporate social performance, according to some theoretical
 perspectives (Shane & Spicer, 1983; Spicer, 1978), lowers investment risk.
 Our regression results give strong evidence of institutional risk aversion,
 indicating that when firm size, financial performance, and industry are all
 held constant, there is a negative relationship between the debt-to-asset ratio
 and institutional ownership. This risk aversion, then, can be translated into
 a preference for strong CSP, which is what seems to emerge here. Using

 efficient market theory, we interpret this reduction in risk as a lower risk-
 adjusted discount rate. Such a decrease would lead a rational investor to
 place a higher value on a stock, which in turn would cause managers to be
 more willing to make decisions that would yield higher CSP.

 The differences in the significance levels of the first three and the sec-
 ond three equations require some explanation. Our correlation table shows
 a very weak relationship between the percentage of shares owned and the
 number of institutions holding shares in a company. Our regression results
 are consistent with that weak correlation, since one can observe an increase
 in the number of institutions owning a stock with no attendant increase in
 the percentage of shares owned if the growth in institutional owners results
 mostly from growth in the number of small institutional owners. Many of the
 newer socially responsible money management institutions are small ones,
 and this fact seems to be one reasonable explanation of the difference in the
 significance levels of the two groups of models. For example, eight socially
 responsible equity mutual funds reported by the Social Investment Forum in
 late 1992 held an average $147 million in assets, but the 231 equity funds
 reported by Morningstar Mutual Funds for 1993 held an average $587 mil-
 lion in assets.

 Another explanation of the difference in significance levels is related to

 the difference in the kinds of decisions that each represents. The number-
 of-institutions dependent variable is related to a relatively simple, binary
 decision by an institution's managers: Will the institution own a stock or
 not? Clearly, some (socially responsible) institutional investors will make
 such a decision in part on the basis of the corporate social performance of the
 firm in question. The percentage-of-shares decision, however, is a consider-
 ably more complicated one. Having made a decision to own stock in a firm,
 institutional investors may consider a host of other factors that are exoge-
 nous to our model. For example, following appropriate portfolio theory, an
 institution's managers may consider the covariance in returns between two
 firms, both with acceptable corporate social performance, and this may in-
 fluence the size of the position they take. Further it has lately become fash-
 ionable to invest in high-CSP companies. But high-CSP companies as a
 group perform about the same as the market (Coffee & Fryxell, 1991; Social
 Investment Forum, 1993), neither substantially better nor worse. And so, in
 the absence of strong financial motivation, some institutions may be reacting
 to a current need to look socially responsible by making small or token
 investments in high-CSP companies.

 This article advances the study of corporate social performance and

 institutional ownership by adding a new, improved measure to a field in
 which measurement problems have always been serious. Our data allowed
 us to conclude that institutions buy stock in companies when corporate
 social performance improves. Our study and the previous work of others
 suggest that managers can conclude that improving a company's social per-
 formance will not depress institutional stock ownership.
