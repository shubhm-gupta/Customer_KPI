ABSTRACT. This
the moderating
effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the
association between market orientation and firm perfor-
mance in the context of an emerging economy. The
results from a sample of
firms that operate in Dubai
indicate that CSR has a synergistic effect on the impact of
market orientation on business performance. The results
of our research on the moderating effects of CSR on
market orientation subsets reveal
that although CSR
moderates the association between customer orientation
and business performance,
it does not moderate the
association between competitive orientation and inter-
functional coordination and performance. The results of
this study are discussed, and implications for practitioners
and researchers are presented.

Introduction

Unfolding the determinants of ﬁrm performance is a
central aim of strategic management scholarship. For
nearly two decades,
the market orientation per-
spective has facilitated researchers’ understanding of
the link between ﬁrms’ strategy and ﬁnancial per-
formance (Han et al., 1998; Jaworski and Kohli, 1996;
Kirca et al., 2005; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Narver
and Slater, 1990), customer satisfaction and retention
(Narver and Slater, 1990; Slater and Narver, 1994),
and employee commitment (Matsuno et al., 2002).
The market orientation perspective is predicated
on the assumption that ﬁrms gain and sustain
their competitive advantage by effectively serving
dominant stakeholders and constantly meeting the
changing needs of the market (Narver and Slater,
1990).

Critics argue, however, that the market orienta-
tion perspective suffers from a signiﬁcant ‘‘black
box’’ challenge (Ellinger et al., 2008). That is, al-
though scholars have offered a number of convinc-
ing arguments to assert the positive link between a
ﬁrm’s market orientation and its performance (Kirca
et al., 2005), the underlying determinants for this
assertion remain illusive. Zhou et al. (2008, p. 985)
argue that despite the strong appeal of market ori-
entation, ‘‘simply assessing the direct link between
market orientation and performance is not fruitful’’.
Scholars contend that
the relationship between
market orientation and ﬁrms’ performance is an
outcome of interactions amongst a number of stra-
tegic actions – a topic that is much less researched
(Olavarrieta and Friedmann, 2008). Scholars have
recently advocated that a better understanding of the
association between market orientation and perfor-
mance lies in the study of market orientation as a
component of a bundle of other strategic actions
(Cano et al., 2004). In response to their recom-
mendation, this study aims to examine the interac-
tion effects of market orientation and corporate
social responsibility (CSR) on performance.

We chose to investigate the impact of bundling
CSR activities and market orientations for several
reasons. First, of all the factors that could inﬂuence
the impact of market orientation, CSR is arguably
one of the most central to the effectiveness of market
orientation. CSR activities are crucial because an
important feature of a market orientation perspective
is its primary focus on a ﬁrm’s ability and willingness
to serve its stakeholders. Therefore, it is plausible to
argue that CSR activities may foster a favourable
relationship between the ﬁrm and its customers and
other dominant stakeholders. This favourable rela-
tionship could ultimately strengthen the market

orientation–performance link (Siu, 1993). Indeed,
observations of the synergistic effects of CSR and
market orientation are not new. Nearly two decades
ago, a seminal paper by Narver and Slater (1990)
acknowledged the link between CSR and market
orientation. Their research argued that since market
orientation requires a clear, external orientation
from organizations, ﬁrms should be sensitive to the
expectations and needs of society in general, not
only to those of their customers and competitors.
Narver and Slater (1990, p. 34) note that
‘‘the
implication of a given magnitude of market orien-
tation is that a business is, to some extent, sensitive
and responsive to any stakeholder or issue that may
affect its long-term performance’’. They propose
that future research should examine ‘‘the relation-
ship between the degree of a business’s market ori-
entation and the extent of its ‘social responsibility’
behavior’’ (p. 34). This study answers their call. The
resource-based view (RBV) of complementary
bundling amongst various practices (Sirmon et al.,
2007, 2008) posits that in order for a ﬁrm to attain
superior performance, its practices must ﬁt, com-
plement, and support each other. By building on
these insights from RBV, we make the case that
market orientation activities are more likely to lead
to higher performance when bundled with com-
plementary activities, such as CSR. Second, whilst
the study of how CSR sits with other strategic ac-
tions is important in its own right, this study is of
particular relevance in the current business envi-
ronment where ﬁrms are expected to pursue CSR
activities (Vogel, 2005).

In addition to shedding light on the association
between market orientation and performance, this
study reﬁnes the growing body of recent research on
the interaction effects of market orientation and
different strategic actions on performance (Wei and
Lau, 2008). One of the major shortcomings of extant
studies is their treatment of market orientation as a
single cohesive strategy. In this study, we unpack
market orientation into its three main subsets and
examine the interactive effects of CSR upon each of
them. Researchers have long argued that whilst
market orientation encompasses three components –
consumer, competitive, and inter-functional coor-
dination – ﬁrms tend to focus on some components
more than others (Day and Nedungadi, 1994; Hunt
and Morgan, 1995; Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Kohli

and Jaworski, 1990; Theoharakis and Hooley, 2008).
Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that the
combined effect of the three components is not
necessarily synergistic (Grinstein, 2008) and that
some subsets of market orientation may ﬁt better
with other strategic options than others. Therefore,
this study examines the interactive link between
CSR and each subset of market orientation. In so
doing, this study provides a ﬁne-grained analysis of
the effects of the interaction between market ori-
entation and CSR. Another key limitation of extant
research is
its over-reliance on ﬁnancial perfor-
mance, which, in isolation, does not capture a ﬁrm’s
overall performance (Husted and Allen, 2007).
Market orientation literature identiﬁes three differ-
ent effects: ﬁnancial performance, employee com-
mitment, and corporate reputation (Jaworski and
Kohli, 1993; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990). In this
study, we examine the association between mar-
ket orientation, CSR, and the oft-used ﬁnancial
performance measure, as well as two leading per-
formance indicators: employees’ commitment and
corporate reputation. In so doing, we hope to pro-
vide a deeper insight into the interactions between
CSR and market orientation and the different per-
formance outcomes.

This study focuses on the association between
market orientation, CSR, and ﬁrm performance in
the context of an emerging economy. Given the
recent adoption of market orientation (Wei and Lau,
2008) and CSR strategies by ﬁrms in emerging
economies (Rettab et al., 2009), we believe that it is
time to investigate the potential impact of bundling
the two strategies on performance. The successful
research of the effects of these strategies on ﬁrms in
emerging economies closes a number of gaps in our
knowledge about the association between market
orientation, CSR, and performance. Compared to
research in developed countries, research on the
relationship between market orientation and per-
formance in emerging economies is limited (Dwairi
et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008). Almost all research
on the strategic value of CSR has focused on ﬁrms
that operate in developed countries (Rettab et al.,
2009). Whilst extant research on developed Western
countries is informative, this body of research aims
to greatly increase the limited insight into the impact
of market orientation and CSR on performance in
emerging economies. Extant research advocates that

though limited, make the case for

ﬁrms in emerging economies tend to adopt strategic
actions in a piecemeal fashion that may lead to the
adoption of incompatible and internally inconsistent
strategies. Furthermore, scholars have recently ex-
tolled the exploration of that link, and a number of
studies,
the
necessity of examining the association between
market orientation and performance in emerging
economies (Anwar and Sohail, 2003; Dwairi et al.,
2007; Kuada and Buatsi, 2005; Zhou et al., 2008).
In the next section of this article, we discuss re-
lated literature and develop ﬁve hypotheses. The
following two sections explore our method and
analyse the data, and the ﬁnal section discusses the
results and limitations of this study.

Literature review and hypotheses

Market orientation and performance

The market-oriented perspective has generated a
substantive body of research over the years (Svensson,
2001). Indeed, as early as the 1950s, McKitterick
(1958) highlighted the positive relationship of ﬁrms
that are responsive to stakeholders’ needs, manage the
competitive landscape, and coordinate their internal
activities and performance. Narver and Slater (1990,
p. 21) deﬁne market orientation as ‘‘the organizational
culture … that most effectively and efﬁciently creates
the necessary behaviors for the creation of superior
value for buyers and, thus, continuous superior per-
formance for the business’’. Recently, scholars have
viewed market orientation as a key capability that has
the potential to alter existing resources into superior
performance (Hult et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2008).
There is near consensus in the literature that market
orientation has a positive impact on business perfor-
mance. Past research provides evidence to suggest that
market orientation has a positive impact on business
performance, including ﬁnancial performance (Day,
1994; Han et al., 1998; Jaworski and Kohli, 1996;
Kirca et al., 2005; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Narver
and Slater, 1990), customer satisfaction and retention
(Narver and Slater, 1990), and employee commit-
ment (Matsuno et al., 2002).

(Anwar and Sohail, 2003; Dwairi et al., 2007; Kuada
and Buatsi, 2005; Wei and Lau, 2008; Zhou et al.,
2008). We contend that Dubai is no exception to
this association between market orientation and
business performance. Given Dubai’s free market
economy, competition in the marketplace is the
prime mechanism for achieving sustainable com-
petitive advantage. Furthermore, the weak – and
sometimes total absence of – regulations in Dubai
facilitate ﬁerce
the
importance of market orientation. In particular,
ﬁrms
initiatives respond
effectively to continuously changing consumer needs
and achieve higher performance (Rettab et al.,
2009). Therefore, this study proposes the following

H1: Market orientation has a positive association

with business performance.

Market orientation, CSR, and performance

Central to this study’s thesis is the concept of ‘‘ﬁt’’ or
complementary bundling amongst the various stra-
tegic actions (Sirmon et al., 2007, 2008). For supe-
rior performance to occur, the different strategic
actions must ﬁt, complement, and support each
other. According to the RBV theory, the perfor-
mance of ﬁrms
largely depends on their ability
to coordinate their strategic actions and bundle
resources and capabilities in an effective yet efﬁcient
manner (Barney, 1991). An effective bundling of
resources and capabilities produces what Teece et al.
(1997, p. 509) call ‘‘the ﬁrm’s portfolio of difﬁcult-
to-trade knowledge assets’’, which gives ﬁrms a
sustainable competitive advantage.
the
extensive research on ﬁrms’ resources and capabili-
ties shows that ﬁrms’ synergistic activities often yield
higher beneﬁts when they are combined effectively
(Black and Boal, 1994).

Indeed,

Theoretically, the presence of CSR may amplify
the association between market orientation and
performance, because CSR reinforces consumer and
employee trust in the organisation. Scholars argue
that CSR gives market orientation activities a
humanistic touch that may improve consumers’
perception of

the ﬁrm (Barone et

Anis Ben Brik et al.

Sen et al., 2006; Vogel, 2005; Webb et al., 2007).
McWilliams and Siegel (2001, p. 120) note that
CSR ‘‘creates a reputation that a ﬁrm is reliable and
honest’’. Furthermore, CSR increases employee
commitment to the organisation, which ultimately
enhances performance (Albinger
and Freeman,
2000; Backhaus et al., 2002; Greening and Turban,
2000; Maignan et al., 1999; Peterson, 2004; Turban
and Greening, 1997). Taken together, we contend
that even though market orientation itself may yield
high business performance, market orientation is
likely to result in even higher performance when
bundled with complementary activities,
such as
CSR. Therefore, the combination of market ori-
entation and CSR has the potential to generate
higher performance for organisations.

H2: CSR has a positive inﬂuence on the relationship
between market orientation and business per-
formance such that at a higher level of CSR,
market orientation has a stronger association
with performance than at a lower level of CSR.

Market orientation subsets, CSR, and performance

to a ﬁrm’s use of

By building on past research (Jaworski and Kohli,
1993; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990), we conceptualise
market orientation as a tripod for success that consists
of three components: customer orientation, com-
petitor orientation, and inter-functional coordina-
tion. Consumer orientation refers to the extent to
which a ﬁrm identiﬁes with its target customers,
often through continuous market
research, and
learns the best ways to serve them. Competitive ori-
entation refers
its capabilities,
strengths, and weaknesses vis-a`-vis its competitors.
Inter-functional
coordination refers to the level and
magnitude of information sharing and coordination
amongst the different levels and functions within a
ﬁrm (Song and Montoya-Weiss, 2001). Researchers
have long asserted that, whilst market orientation
encompasses these three subsets of components, or-
ganisations tend to focus on some components more
than others. As discussed below, CSR ﬁts some
market orientation subsets better
than others;
therefore, one would expect some interactive effects
to be different. That is, the interactive effects of
CSR with market orientation depend on the level of

congruity between the subsets of market orientation
and CSR activities. Below, we propose three
hypotheses on the possible outcomes of the inter-
active effects of CSR with customer orientation,
competitive orientation, and inter-functional orien-
tation.

and friendly after-sale service’’

Customer orientation: CSR and performance
Customer orientation refers to the degree to which
ﬁrms seek to understand and satisfy their core cus-
tomers’ needs (Donavan et al., 2004; Theoharakis
and Hooley, 2008), which includes delivering
products safely and reliably, helping customers to
make the right purchase, and ‘‘providing responsive,
fair
(Liao and
Subramony, 2008). Although customer orientation
focuses on achieving superior customer satisfaction
(Kirca et al., 2005), the process through which this is
attained is congruent with the primary aim of CSR
activities. Providing safe and reliable products or
offering effective after-sale services helps ﬁrms to
carry out customer orientation activities whilst
pursuing CSR objectives. In general, a ﬁrm’s pre-
disposition to meeting customers’ needs sits com-
fortably with its quest to be a socially responsible
organisation. What is even more promising is that
research shows
that employees – salespeople in
particular – are more committed to their organisa-
tion, have higher levels of job satisfaction, and are
more enthusiastic about market orientation activi-
ties when they perceive their ﬁrm’s activities as
socially responsible (Bhattacharya and Sen, 2003;
McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Their enthusiasm
comes from the fact that employees generally have
an ethical and responsible tendency or predisposition
to meet customer needs (McWilliams and Siegel,
2001). Based on the aforementioned discussion of
the synergistic combination of the two practices, this
study predicts that, when combined, customer ori-
entation and CSR have a synergistic effect on
business performance.

H3: CSR has a positive inﬂuence on the relation-
ship between customer orientation and per-
formance such that at a higher level of CSR,
the association between customer orientation
and performance is stronger than at a lower
level of CSR.


Market Orientation, CSR, and Business Performance

311

Competitive orientation: CSR and performance
Competitive orientation is deﬁned as a ﬁrm’s efforts
to monitor its rivals’ activities, resources, and capa-
bilities, and how the ﬁrm seeks to outperform its
rivals or to remove its rivals from the competitive
arena. Competitive orientation fosters an aggressive
culture that emphasises winning and outperforming
at any cost. Thus, we contend that competitive
orientation actions are not always congruent with
CSR activities, because CSR is not essential to the
success of competitive orientation activities (Cottrill,
1990). Rather, under the pressure to outperform
competitors, organisational members may pay less
attention to the well-being of some of
its core
stakeholders and its wider society. As a result, a ﬁrm
may reduce CSR to organisational rhetoric that
could ultimately do the ﬁrm more harm than good.
Furthermore,
is plausible that organisational
members may not be able to align their efforts of
achieving the ultimate goal of outperforming com-
petitors at any cost and being socially responsible
(Mellahi et al., 2009). Consequently, CSR may
become a distraction to an aggressively competitive
ﬁrm, as its members must pay lip service and pretend
to display CSR-oriented attitudes whilst they would
rather be conducting other types of performance
tasks. Therefore, we argue that if a ﬁrm bundles
activities
such as
competitive orientation and CSR, this bundling is
likely to lead to diminished business performance.

that are not complementary,

it

H4: CSR has a negative inﬂuence on the rela-
tionship between competitive orientation and
performance such that at a higher level of
CSR, competitive orientation has a negative
relationship with performance, and at a lower
level of CSR, competitive orientation has a
positive relationship with performance.

Inter-functional orientation: CSR and performance
Inter-functional orientation refers to the degree of
communication and interaction amongst organisa-
tional members in their pursuit to offer superior
value to customers
(Im and Workman, 2004).
Narver and Slater (1990) argue that cross-function
coordination helps ﬁrms to acquire, integrate, and
disseminate market
systematically,
which, in turn, helps them to develop innovative

intelligence

therefore,

marketing programs to serve customers. CSR and
fundamentally
inter-functional orientation address
separate activities;
their combination
would not have a synergistic effect on performance.
Although inter-functional orientation may help
individuals who are keenly aware of and enthusiastic
about CSR to disseminate such activities across
functions, the two sets of activities do not synergis-
tically interact to improve business performance.

H5: CSR does not

signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
relationship between inter-functional orienta-
tion and performance.

Data collection

The sampling frame consisted of 2,200 companies
that were drawn from the membership database of
the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(DCCI). Each of
the 2,200 questionnaires was
e-mailed and/or faxed to a top manager in each ﬁrm
along with a letter that explained the nature of the
study and promised conﬁdentiality. Three weeks
after the original mailing, the researchers sent two
follow-up distributions, which included duplicate
cover letters and questionnaires, to all ﬁrms that
did not respond. Repeated follow-ups were sent
3 weeks after each previous mailing. This study used
Armstrong and Overton’s
(1977) extrapolation
procedure to assess non-response bias. The analysis
did not show signiﬁcant differences between early
and late respondents. The response rate was 14%
(310 ﬁrms). A total of 280 ﬁrms remained in the
sample after we eliminated those that missed market
orientation, CSR, and/or business performance data,
resulting in a ﬁnal response rate of 13%.

Measures

Independent variables

Market orientation: We used Narver and Slater’s
(1990)
scale to measure market orientation (see
Deng and Dart, 1994; Deshpande´ and Farley, 1998;
Deshpande´ et al., 1993; Pelham, 2000; Ruekert,
1992). All items are scored on a 5-point scale in


312

Anis Ben Brik et al.

which 1 equals ‘‘strongly disagree’’ and 5 equals
‘‘strongly agree’’. All Cronbach as are above the
threshold of 0.72.

CSR: This study used the well-established con-
struct developed by Maignan and Ferrell (2004) to
measure CSR: a 26-item scale for six CSR practices,
including community responsibility, environmen-
tal responsibility, employee responsibility, investor
responsibility, customer responsibility, and supplier
responsibility. Respondents were asked to indicate
the extent
to which each item reﬂected their
organisation by applying a 5-point Likert scale with
1 equalling ‘‘strongly disagree’’ and 5 equalling
‘‘strongly agree’’. The scale reliabilities (Cronbach as)
are: community responsibilities
(a 4-item scale,
Cronbach a = 0.87), environmental responsibilities
(a 4-item scale, a = 0.83), employee responsibilities
(a 5-item scale, a =0.78), investor responsibilities (a
4-item scale, a = 0.78), customer responsibilities
(a 4-item scale, a = 0.85), and supplier responsibilities
(a 5-item scale, a = 0.78).

Dependent variable

One of the key limitations of extant research is
researchers’ over-reliance on ﬁnancial performance,
which, in isolation, does not capture a given ﬁrm’s
overall performance (Husted and Allen, 2007).
This study adopted a measure of business perfor-
mance, which includes three indicators: ﬁnancial
performance, employee commitment, and corpo-
rate reputation. For ﬁnancial performance,
the
seven items: a one-item scale
survey includes
developed by Samiee and Roth (1992), along with
four speciﬁc performance items that assess market
share, growth, proﬁtability, and size (adapted from
the scale by Deshpande´ et al., 1993). This study
also used two additional
to assess general
performance and performance relative to competi-
tors
(adapted from Jaworski and Kohli, 1993).
Respondents reported the extent to which their
organisation’s return on investment, return on as-
sets,
sales growth, and proﬁt growth had been
substantially better over the last year in relation to
their most relevant competitors.

items

We used three items adapted from a scale devel-
oped by Fombrun et al. (2000) to measure execu-
tives’ perceptions of their ﬁrms’ reputations, and

(1993)

Jaworski and Kohli’s
three-item scale to
measure employee commitment. A number of
scholars (Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Weigelt and
Camerer, 1988) argue that ﬁrms that possess positive
reputations have a competitive edge over their rivals.
We asked respondents to indicate the extent to
which each item reﬂected their organisation by using
a 5-point Likert scale (1 equals ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to
5 equals ‘‘strongly agree’’). The Cronbach as for
ﬁnancial performance, corporate reputation, and
employee commitment were 0.85, 0.70, and 0.84,
respectively. The business performance measure
combined the three measures – ﬁnancial perfor-
mance, employee commitment, and reputation –
into a single calculation.

Control variables

This study controlled for three variables that are
reported to have a signiﬁcant impact on the effects of
market orientation and CSR on business perfor-
mance. First, past research provides evidence that the
size of a ﬁrm has an impact on the association be-
tween market orientation (Liu, 1995), CSR (Moore,
2001; Preston, 1978; Stanwick and Stanwick, 1998),
and business performance. Stakeholders expect more
social initiatives from large corporations than from
small ones. For example, large multinationals and
publicly traded companies are pressured to display a
commitment to CSR as a result of consumer and
shareholder activism against
large multinationals
(Drawbaugh, 2001; Klein, 1999). Furthermore,
small ﬁrms are less able than their large counterparts
to communicate their CSR activities to external
stakeholders. Thus, this study controlled for the size
of the ﬁrm and measured size by the number of
employees.

Second, the relationship between market orien-
tation and performance depends on the sector of
activities (Sanzo et al., 2003). Further, Kolk (2003)
reported that different types of industries will have
varying propensities to engage in CSR initiatives.
Thus, this study controlled for the sector of activi-
ties. Third, consistent with past research (Delaney
and Huselid, 1996; Sanzo et al., 2003), this study
controlled for the age of the ﬁrm. This study mea-
sured age by the number of years since the ﬁrm’s
establishment in Dubai.

Sample characteristics and descriptive statistics

The sample comprised 61 manufacturing ﬁrms; 51
trading and repair services ﬁrms; 64 hotels and res-
taurants; 65 real estate, property management, and
business services ﬁrms; 18 educational organisations;
17 banking and ﬁnancial services ﬁrms; 2 mining
ﬁrms; and 2 ﬁrms that were unable to classify their
sector of activity. The executives who responded
had been with their ﬁrms for an average of 11 years
and represented ﬁrms that had existed for an average
of 18 years and employed an average of 276 indi-
viduals.

Table I presents the means, standard deviation,
and correlations amongst the different sets of vari-
ables that we used to test our hypotheses. Correla-
tions amongst business performance, CSR, and the
three components of market orientation are signiﬁ-
cantly interrelated, suggesting a potential association
amongst these variables.

Our
examination to test
(Cohen and
Cohen, 1983). Following Cohen and Cohen (1983),
our analyses standardised all variables to reduce the
potential effects of multicollinearity. The analyses
employed a mean-centring procedure for the vari-
ables of CSR, business performance, market orien-
tation, customer orientation, competitor orientation,
and inter-functional coordination. In turn, the var-

iance inﬂation factor for each of
the regression
coefﬁcients was well below the recommended
threshold of 10 (lowest = 1.04, highest = 4.89)
(Neter et al., 1985), indicating that multicollinearity
does not affect the weights of the controls or the
hypothesised variables (Mason and Perreault, 1991).
As a ﬁrst step in testing the hypotheses, we en-
tered CSR and control variables, including industry
sector (IS), ﬁrm size (FS), and ﬁrm age (FA), as a
block, followed by the main effects of market ori-
entation (MO) and the interaction effects of CSR
and MO. Speciﬁcally, this study analysed the fol-
lowing regression equation in three hierarchical
steps:
Y ¼ a þ b1X1 þ b2X2 þ b3X3 þ b4X4 þ b5X5

þ b6X4X5 þ e

where Y is the business performance (BP), a is the
intercept, X1 is the industry sector (IS), X2 is the
ﬁrm size, X3 is the ﬁrm age, X4 is the CSR, X5 is
the market orientation (MO), and e is the random
disturbance terms.
Although this

study did not hypothesise the
relationship between CSR and business perfor-
mance, the ﬁrst step of this study tested this rela-
tionship by entering control variables
(industry
sector, ﬁrm size, and ﬁrm age) and CSR. The results
show a signiﬁcant positive association between CSR
and business performance, which explains 32% of
the variance in business performance as F (4,181) =
21.2, p < 0.05.

support

the ﬁrst hypothesis

In step 2, this study tested for the main effect of
market orientation on business performance. The
results
(F = 21.6,
p < 0.05, R2 = 0.37). In step 3, this study tested
hypothesis 2 by examining the interactive effects of
CSR 9 MO, (Model 3). The results were statistically
signiﬁcant. The inclusion of the interaction terms in
step 3 explained 40% of the variance in business
performance, F (6,181) = 19.06, p < 0.05, and a
very small signiﬁcant variance beyond step 2 (A¨
= 0.02, p < 0.05), providing support for
R(CSR 9 MO)
hypothesis 2. The results are presented in Table II. To
further explore the interactive effects of CSR and
market orientation on each of the three performance
measures (i.e. ﬁnancial performance, corporate rep-
utation, and employee commitment), we repeated the
above steps by applying single performance measures.
To reduce the amount of visual documentation, we
summarised the regression results in a single table
(Table III) to depict only the full models. Table III
reveals that whilst CSR signiﬁcantly moderates the
relationships between market orientation, ﬁnancial
performance, and corporate reputation,
it has no
moderating effects on employee commitment.

To explore the direction of

these signiﬁcant
interactions, we plotted the different interactions
(Aiken and West, 1991). We set the level of CSR at

one standard deviation above and below the mean. All
control variables are ﬁxed at their means. Figure 1
reveals that, at a high level of CSR, the association
between market orientation and business performance
is positive and strong. However, as indicated by the
ﬂat slope, the strength of the association between
market orientation and business performance dimin-
ishes signiﬁcantly at a low level of CSR. Thus,
hypothesis 2 is supported. Figures 2 and 3 reveal that,
at a high level of CSR, the associations between
market orientation and ﬁnancial performance and
corporate reputation are positive and strong; how-
ever, the strength of these associations is greatly
diminished and becomes insigniﬁcant at a low level of
CSR, thus providing further support for hypothesis 2.
To test hypotheses 3, 4, and 5, this study exam-
ined the interaction effects of CSR, customer
orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-func-
tional coordination (see Table IV). This study ana-
lysed the following:

suggest

operate in isolation, and studying them under such a
condition fails to capture their simultaneous effects
on performance. Speciﬁcally, this study examines the
moderating effects of CSR and proposes that CSR
activities have a synergistic inﬂuence on the rela-
tionship between market orientation and business
performance. The results provide support for this
article’s core proposition and demonstrate that the
association with performance is
strongest when
market orientation and CSR are bundled together.
These ﬁndings support previous studies in RBV
and dynamic capabilities literature that advocate a
bundling hypothesis. Furthermore, recent market
orientation studies
that bundling market
orientation with other compatible management
activities is likely to enhance business performance
(Baker and Sinkula, 1999; Matsuno and Mentzer,
2000; Wei and Lau, 2008). Our results speciﬁcally
reveal that the association between market orienta-
tion and business performance is stronger at a high
level of CSR than at a low level of CSR. This means
that high levels of CSR and market orientation lead
to optimal performance levels. Given the lack of
consensus on how and even whether or not CSR
affects business performance (Husted and Allen,
2007; Margolis and Walsh, 2001, 2003; McWilliams
and Siegel, 2000; Orlitzky and Benjamin, 2001;
Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wright and Ferris, 1997), these
results provide support for the positive impact of
CSR on performance. For practitioners, these results
suggest that organisations ought to view CSR and
market orientation as synergistic rather than as two
strategies that compete for resources. These ﬁndings
are particularly important
in the context of an
emerging economy in which a number of scholars
have made a case for a negative effect of CSR on
business performance. Their argument is predicated
on the assumption that CSR is incompatible with
market strategies in emerging economies due to
the absence of strong institutional support for CSR
and the presence of weak and ineffectual
laws to
guard against unethical practices. Firms in emerging
economies may not capture rents from their CSR
activities, and such activities may even put ﬁrms at a
competitive disadvantage vis-a`-vis their competitors
(Foo, 2007). Rettab et al. (2009) note that, due to
the lack of communication platforms for dissemi-
nating information about CSR activities in emerging
economies, CSR efforts often go unnoticed and are

Figure 3. Market orientation and corporate reputation
by CSR.

The results in Table IV reveal that CSR signiﬁ-
cantly moderates the association between customer
orientation and ﬁnancial performance, but this effect
only partially supports hypothesis 3, as this moderation
becomes insigniﬁcant in the full model (Model 7).
The results show no signiﬁcant interactive effects
between CSR and the other two subsets of market
orientation, thus rejecting hypothesis 4 and support-
ing hypothesis 5. To further explore these results, we
conducted additional analyses on the association be-
tween CSR, market orientation, and the three per-
formance measures: ﬁnancial performance, corporate
reputation, and employee commitment. The results in
Table V show that all interactions are insigniﬁcant,
with the exception of the relationship between cus-
tomer orientation and ﬁnancial performance, thus
lending further support for hypothesis 3.

We plotted the signiﬁcant interaction between
customer orientation and ﬁnancial performance in
order to explore the directions of the interaction.
Figure 4 reveals that, at a low level of CSR, customer
orientation has a signiﬁcant negative moderating ef-
fect on ﬁnancial performance. However, this associ-
ation becomes positive, albeit weak, at a high level of
CSR.

Discussion

This study advocates the need for strategy scholars to
look beyond the main effects, such as market ori-
entation and ﬁrm performance, in their examination
of associations between strategic actions. The core
argument of this study is that strategic actions do not

mance by CSR.

largely unknown to stakeholders. Thus, CSR
activities in emerging economies may not have an
impact on performance. Further, Mellahi and
Wood (2003) caution that stakeholders are often
not aware of CSR activities in emerging economies
and, as a result, such activities may even have a
negative impact on ﬁnancial performance. Taken
together, this body of literature stipulates that CSR
has no place in these countries (Rettab et al., 2009).
Foo (2007) argues that the dominant paradigm in
emerging economies is captured by the saying:
‘‘they (competitors) are ethical, so we have the
competitive edge!’’ This study challenges this no-
tion by showing that the higher the level of CSR,
the stronger the impact of market orientation on
performance.

The results, which portray the interactive effects
of CSR and market orientation using different
business performance measures, reveal interesting
information. They show that whilst CSR has a
synergistic effect on the association between market
orientation and ﬁnancial performance and corpo-
rate reputation, it does not moderate the association
between market orientation and employee com-
mitment. A plausible explanation for our results is
the fact that over 80% of employees in Dubai are
expatriates who are employed on short-term con-
tracts in which human resource strategies are based
primarily on calculative commitment with little
emphasis on attitudinal dedication (Budhwar and
Mellahi, 2007). In such a context, employees are
unlikely to care about CSR activities as they are
more attached to their home country than the host
country in which CSR activities have most impact
(Forstlenlechner and Mellahi, 2011). Organizations

may address this issue by engaging in CSR activities
in expatriates home countries.

In brief, the results suggest that scholars need to
study the integration of market orientation with
other practices in order to offer a more holistic
understanding of the association between market
orientation and performance. Scholars could better
predict the association between market orientation
and performance by taking into account the inter-
active impact of the other strategic actions that are
pursued by organisations. Indeed, if an organisation
pursues market orientation and simultaneously en-
acts practices that may cancel out its effects, the
chances that market orientation will have a signiﬁ-
cant impact on performance are low. For practitio-
ners, these ﬁndings suggest that organisations reap
more value if they bundle market orientation with
complementary practices; therefore, market orien-
tation and CSR should be seen as part of a bundle of
practices rather than isolated components.

In addition to exploring the moderation of CSR
on market orientation and business performance, this
study provides a more ﬁne-grained analysis of CSR
by examining the interactive effects amongst CSR
and the market orientation subsets. This study posits
that the interactive effects of CSR on the association
between market orientation and performance might
vary. In so doing, it advances the body of research
that states that market orientation is not a uniﬁed set
of practices, and argues that CSR is more compatible
with some subsets of market orientation than others.
As expected, our results show that CSR moderates
the performance–customer orientation relationship;
however, this moderation was not signiﬁcant in the
full mode. Contrary to the expectations of this study,
the presumed deleterious effect of CSR on the
association between competitive orientation and
performance was not supported; rather, the results
show that, when combined, the two practices would
have no signiﬁcant impact on performance. Finally,
as expected, the results show that the combination of
CSR with inter-functional orientation does not lead
to signiﬁcantly superior performance. These results
conﬁrm our assertion that CSR interacts differently
with the different market orientation subsets.
Overall, the results show that the association be-
tween market orientation subsets and performance,
with the exception of customer orientation, did not
change signiﬁcantly at different levels of CSR. These

results indicate that ﬁrms are likely to beneﬁt from
bundling market orientation with CSR when mar-
ket orientation is approached as a holistic strategy,
using its three subsets simultaneously.

To shed further light on these results, we con-
ducted an extensive analysis on the moderating ef-
fects of CSR on the association between market
orientation subsets and business performance by
using different measures for business performance.
The results reveal that, at a low level of CSR, cus-
tomer orientation has a signiﬁcant negative moder-
ating effect on ﬁnancial performance. Such an
association becomes positive, albeit weak, at a high
level of CSR. This result indicates that reacting to
perceived customer needs
to produce
superior value for customers is inadequate for gen-
erating higher ﬁnancial performance in the absence
of CSR activities. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst study that provides evidence to show that
a high level of CSR does not only enhance perfor-
mance, but even ﬁnancial performance may suffer if
a ﬁrm does not pay attention to CSR issues.

Limitations

The results and their interpretation must be con-
sidered in the context of this study’s limitations.
Whilst the ﬁndings support the interactive effects,
this study does not disentangle how CSR and mar-
ket orientation and its subsets interact to inﬂuence
performance. Additional ﬁne-grained research using
in-depth case studies is needed to help us fully
understand the dynamics and processes
through
which CSR and market orientation impact perfor-
mance. Another major caveat of this study is that the
sample draws from a fast-growing and highly com-
petitive emerging economy with a unique institu-
tional environment. Although we went beyond
merely ﬁnancial performance and combined three
different performance indicators
into an overall
measure of business performance, one could include
new indicators, such as customer satisfaction and
loyalty. It would be interesting to explore whether
the ﬁndings of this study hold in other emerging
economies. Furthermore, our study is based on
perceptual data, and although perceptual measures of
business performance are well established and widely
accepted, we welcome studies that are based on

objective data, particularly regarding ﬁnancial mea-
sures of performance.

Note

for each construct

1 Before we conducted the analysis, we subjected our
constructs to a number of tests to check their reliability
and validity. Following the steps used by Slater et al.
(2006, p. 1226), we analysed the psychometric properties
of the constructs used in this study with the conﬁrmatory
factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL 8.80. In addition, we
evaluated the ﬁt of
the measurement model. Again,
following Slater et al. (2006), we examined the high-or-
der structure of CSR to provide empirical support for the
focus on the CSR construct at the higher-order aggregate
level. We assessed the construct reliability by calculating a
composite reliability (CR) for each construct. We used
the procedures suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981)
to calculate the CR index (CRI). Along with the reliabil-
ity calculations, we also examined the parameter estimates
and their associated t-values and assessed the average vari-
ance extracted (AVE)
(Anderson,
1982; Bagozzi and Lynn, 1982). AVE was used to gauge
convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Ping,
2004). Fornell and Larcker (1981) and Ping (2004) sug-
gested that convergent measures should contain less than
50% error variance (i.e. AVE should be 0.5 or above).
We used the cut-off value of 0.70 and 0.50 for CR and
AVE, respectively (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Hair et al.,
1998). The scales’ reliabilities ranged from 0.78 to 0.88,
the factor loadings ranged from 0.40 to 0.92 (p < 0.01),
and the AVE ranged from 0.50 to 0.89. Following the
reliability analysis, we established discriminant validity by
calculating the shared variances between each pair of
constructs and verifying that it was lower than the AVE
from the individual constructs (Bagozzi and Lynn, 1982).
The shared variances between pairs of all possible scale
combinations indicated that the average variances ex-
tracted were higher than the associated shared variance in
all cases. In other words, they are more internally corre-
lated than they are with other constructs. This suggests
the discriminant validity of the construct in this study.
The model ﬁt was evaluated using a series of indices rec-
ommended by Hu and Bentler (1999): the DELTA2
(Bollen, 1989), comparative ﬁt (CFI) (Bentler, 1990; Hu
and Bentler, 1999), goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI), Tucker–
Lewis (TLI), and the root mean square error of approxi-
mation (RMSEA) indices. A ﬁt to the data was achieved
for the ﬁrst-order-based CFA.
