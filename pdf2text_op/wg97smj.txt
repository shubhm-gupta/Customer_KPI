 THE CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE-
 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE LINK

 setts, U.S.A.

 Strategic managers are consistently faced with the decision of how to allocate scarce corporate
 resources in an environment that is placing more and more pressures on them. Recent
 scholarship in strategic management suggests that many of these pressures come directly from
 sources associated with social issues in management, rather than traditional arenas of strategic
 management. Using a greatly improved source of data on corporate social performance, this
 paper reports the results of a rigorous study of the empirical linkages between financial and
 social performance. Corporate social performance (CSP) is found to be positively associated
 with prior financial performance, supporting the theory that slack resource availability and
 CSP are positively related. CSP is also found to be positively associated with future financial
 performance, supporting the theory that good management and CSP are positively related.?

 INTRODUCTION

 Strategic managers are consistently faced with
 the decision of how to allocate scarce corporate
 resources in an environment that is placing more
 and more pressures on them. Recent scholarship
 in strategic management suggests that many of
 these pressures are coming directly not from tra-
 ditional concerns of strategic management but
 instead from concerns about social issues in man-
 agement (see, for example, Prahalad and Hamel,
 1994). Strategic resource allocation decisions
 have always been complex, but now they are
 even more so, since companies are assessed not
 only on the financial outcome of their decisions
 but also on the ways in which their companies
 measure up to a broader set of societal expec-
 tations.

 try-based competitive forces identified by Porter
 (1980). Changing customer expectations, regula-
 tory shifts, problem of excess capacity (and pre-
 sumably the associated employees), and environ-
 mental concerns are now becoming important
 influences on strategy (Prahalad and Hamel,
 1994). These emerging influences on strategic
 decision making are the result of the impact of
 different stakeholder expectations (Freeman,
 1984) and a company's interactions with a range
 of stakeholders arguably comprise its overall cor-
 porate social performance record (cf. Wood,
 1991a, 1991b; Waddock, 1996). To illustrate the
 importance of such influences on companies, it
 should be noted that investors now hold some
 $650 billion in social investment funds. Within
 may of the investment houses that run these so-
 called socially responsible investment funds are
 analysts who carefully screen potential invest-
 ments both on financial and social performance
 criteria.

 ences on strategic decisions now come from
 influences that go well beyond traditional indus-

 disseminated guide called 'Shopping for a Better
 World' that interested consumers use to help
 guide purchasing decisions. More recently inde-
 pendent services have sprung up that evaluate
 companies' social performance across a broad
 range of 'social' activities and sell that infor-
 mation to the investment community. As a result,
 these ratings are now available to the investment
 community as input to investor decisions. These
 ratings services seem to be having an effect on
 some investment decisions, which is evident in
 research that shows that institutional investors are
 favorably inclined toward companies with higher
 corporate social performance when other factors
 are held constant and independent information
 about CSP is available (Teoh and Shiu, 1990;
 Graves and Waddock, 1994).

 Despite these developments, the linkages

 between CSP and financial performance are still
 far from clear (Ullman, 1985). Results of empiri-
 cal work indicate an ambiguous relationship (e.g.,
 Alexander and Buchholz, 1982; Aupperle, Carroll
 and Hatfield, 1985; Ullman, 1985; Shane and
 Spicer, 1983). Further, even when a positive link
 is established (e.g., Wokutch and Spencer, 1987;
 McGuire, Schneeweiss and Sundgren, 1988), it
 is still unclear whether financially successful com-
 panies simply have more resources to spend on
 CSP and therefore attain a higher standard (a
 slack resources theory) or whether better perform-
 ance along various dimensions of CSP itself
 results in better financial outcomes (which we
 will characterize as good management theory)
 (McGuire et al., 1988; Ullman, 1985).

 Using a greatly improved source of data on
 corporate social performance, this paper reports
 the results of a rigorous study of the empirical
 linkages between financial and social perform-
 ance. With a broad-based index of corporate
 social performance, we test whether there is a
 positive relationship between CSP and financial
 performance and whether both slack resource and
 good management theory may be operating simul-
 taneously.

 CSP. CSP is a multidimensional construct, with
 behaviors ranging across a wide variety of inputs
 (e.g., investments in pollution control equipment
 or other environmental strategies), internal
 behaviors or processes (e.g., treatment of women
 and minorities, nature of products produced,
 relationships with customers), and outputs (e.g.,
 community relations and philanthropic programs)
 (see Wood, 1991a, 1991b; Aupperle et al., 1985;
 Wolfe and Aupperle, 1991; Aupperle, 1991;
 Miles, 1987 Gephart, 1991). These behaviors
 also occur across a wide range of industries with
 significantly different characteristics, histories,
 and performance in the different CSP domains
 (see Waddock and Graves, 1994). Further,
 numerous issues, managerial decisions, and cor-
 porate behaviors are encompassed by the term
 CSP (Wood, 1991a, 1991b; Lydenberg, Marlin,
 and Strub, 1986). As a result, little clarity has
 been reached on measurement of CSP, and the
 measures used in empirical work have frequently
 been one-dimensional, and have been applied to
 small samples of companies. There is a clear need
 for a multidimensional measure applied across
 a wide range of industries and larger samples
 of companies.

 CSP measures used in the past have included

 forced-choice survey instruments (Aupperle,
 1991; Aupperle et al., 1985), the Fortune repu-
 tational and social responsibility index or Mos-
 kowitz' reputational scales (Bowman and Haire,
 1975; McGuire et al., 1988; O'Bannon and Pres-
 ton, 1993), content analysis of documents (Wolfe,
 1991), behavioral and perceptual measures
 (Wokutch and McKinney, 1991), and case study
 methodologies resembling social audits (Clarkson,
 1991). In some instances social disclosure has
 been used as a surrogate for CSP (e.g., Preston,
 1978; Abbott and Monson, 1979; Ingram, 1978).
 Pollution control investments are another fre-
 quently used one-dimensional measure (e.g.,
 Bowman and Haire, 1975; Chen and Metcalf,
 1980; Spicer, 1978; Shane and Spicer, 1983).

 Each of these measurements, while offering
 some benefits, has limitations. Survey method-
 ologies have problems relating to return rates and
 consistency of raters across a variety of firms.
 The Fortune rating of CSP tends to be viewed
 as a measure of overall management of a firm
 rather than being specific to CSP. Further, it is
 highly correlated with other measures. Content

 THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM

 One fundamental reason for the uncertainty about
 the relationship between CSP and financial per-
 formance is that a serious problem has plagued
 researchers to date: the problem of measuring

 valuable insights into corporate behavior, depends
 to a large extent on the comprehensiveness and
 purposes for which the documents were originally
 created and can be biased by omission or
 inclusion. Case study methodologies, by their na-
 ture, can be applied to only a limited sampling
 of companies; further, although significant prog-
 ress has been made (e.g., Clarkson, 1991), there
 are problems of consistency across cases studied
 by different research teams. Social disclosure and
 pollution control investments are unidimensional
 measures. Thus, many measures are either unidi-
 mensional and may not properly reflect the overall
 level of a company's CSP or they are difficult
 to apply consistently across the range of industries
 and companies that need to be studied.

 So problematic has been the measurement

 problem that an entire section of the annual
 research volume Research in Corporate Social
 Performance and Policy was devoted to this topic
 (see Wolfe and Aupperle, 1991, for the introduc-
 tion to this special section). The research we
 report in this paper attempts to overcome some
 of the measurement problems that in the past
 have hindered examination of the strategic links
 between firms' CSP and financial performance.

 As noted, many empirical studies of CSP tend

 to focus on only one or two areas of social
 performance while ignoring the rest. It is difficult
 to construct a truly representative CSP measure
 in part because of its complexity and because
 measurements of a single dimension provide too
 limited a perspective on how well a company is
 actually performing in the relevant social domains
 (Lydenberg et al., 1986; Wolfe and Aupperle,
 1991). In part because of the measurement diffi-
 culties, previous findings on the relationship
 between profitability and corporate social per-
 formance have been mixed. Some find tenuous
 positive linkages (McGuire et al., 1988; McGuire,
 Schneeweiss and Branch, 1990; Aupperle et al.,
 1985), others find clear positive relationships
 (Cochran and Wood, 1984), while others docu-
 ment negative linkages (Shane and Spicer, 1983).
 It is simply unclear at this point whether linkages
 between financial performance and CSP exist,
 and if so whether they are positive or negative
 (Aupperle et al., 1985). Ullman provides a com-
 prehensive review of the mixed results up to
 1985, concluding, in fact, that 'the situation per-
 taining to relationships among social performance,
 social disclosure, and economic performance can

 Social-Financial Performance Link 305

 best be characterized at this time as empirical
 data in search of an adequate theory' (1985: 555).

 HYPOTHESES

 In forming our hypotheses, it is evident that there
 are two issues to address: (1) the sign of the
 relationship, and (2) the direction of causation
 (O'Bannon and Preston, 1993). The sign of the
 relationship may indicate negative, neutral, or
 positive linkages between CSP and financial per-
 formance. Separately, it is possible that changes
 in CSP influence financial performance, or the
 opposite, that change in financial performance
 influence CSP. Together, these two issues result
 in a total of six possible hypotheses (O'Bannon
 and Preston, 1993). Below we recount the argu-
 ments for these different hypotheses.

 Negative association

 Those arguing for a negative relationship beween
 social and financial performance believe that firms
 that perform responsibly incur a competitive dis-
 advantage (Aupperle et al., 1985) because they
 are incurring costs that might otherwise be
 avoided or that should be borne by others (e.g.,
 individuals or government). An example of this
 kind of action would be the decision to invest in
 pollution control equipment when other competi-
 tors do not. According to this line of thinking,
 which is fundamental to Friedman's (1970) and
 other neoclassical economists' arguments, there
 are few readily measurable economic benefits to
 socially responsible behavior while there are
 numerous costs. The costs, by this argument, fall
 directly to the bottom line, reducing profits and
 thus shareholder wealth. These theorists expect
 the relationship between CSP and financial per-
 formance to be negative.

 Neutral association

 The empirical results to date lend themselves
 to a second possibility: that there is simply no
 relationship, positive or negative, between social
 and financial performance. Proponents of this line
 of reasoning (e.g., Ullman, 1985) argue that there
 are so many intervening variables between social
 and financial performance that there is no reason
 to expect a relationship to exist, except possibly

 by chance. On the other hand, the measurement
 problems that have plagued CSP research may
 mask any linkage that exists.

 Positive association

 The third perspective, based on stakeholder analy-
 sis, proposes that a tension exists between the
 firm's explicit costs (e.g., payments to
 bondholders) and its implicit costs to other stake-
 holders (e.g., product quality costs, environmental
 costs). This theory predicts that a firm that
 attempts to lower its implicit costs by socially
 irresponsible actions will, as a result, incur higher
 explicit costs, resulting in competitive disadvan-
 tage. According to this argument, then, there is
 a positive relationship between CSP and finan-
 cial performance.

 Finally, some take the position that high levels
 of CSP are indicators of superior management
 skill, and thus lead to lower explicit costs
 (Alexander and Buchholz, 1982), a perspective
 that would tend to be supported by the high
 correlations among Fortune's indicators of good
 management and social performance. The weight
 of these arguments about the potential positive
 benefits of CSP suggests to us that the sign
 of any relationship between financial and social
 performance will be positive, hence we will
 hypothesize that the relationship between social
 and financial performance is a positive one.

 DIRECTION OF CAUSALITY: SLACK
 RESOURCES OR GOOD
 MANAGEMENT?

 A compatible view is that the actual costs of

 CSP are minimal and the benefits potentially
 great. For example, an enlightened employee
 relations policy may have a very low cost, but
 can result in substantial gains in morale and
 productivity, actually yielding a competitive
 advantage in comparison to less responsible firms.
 Firms that are reported in lists of 'best companies
 to work for', for example, may find it easier to
 recruit top quality employees, possibly resulting
 in increases in productivity at relatively low cost
 (e.g., Moskowitz, 1972). Although this argument
 is a fundamentally normative one, there is a
 recent emphasis in strategic management on the
 construction of meaningful strategies that empha-
 size the importance of core values to which
 employees and other key stakeholders can relate.
 Sometimes this 'meaning-making' is called stra-
 tegic intent (e.g., Hamel and Prahalad, 1989).
 Others term it purpose (Bartlett and Ghoshal,
 1994) or enterprise strategy, which is explicit
 about what the corporation 'stands for' in the
 linkages between its values and strategy (Freeman
 and Gilbert, 1988).

 In any case, strategic postures with an overlay
 of social and other normatively defined purposes
 have historically been held in low regard as
 possible sources of competitive advantage. These
 new ideas in strategic management, however, sug-
 gest that such socially embedded purposes and
 strategic postures may be related to positive stra-
 tegic outcomes in important ways. By extension,
 such purposes may have positive impact on fi-
 nancial performance as well.

 The second aspect of the CSP-financial perform-
 ance relationship has to do with the direction of
 causality. Two views, mentioned earlier, can be
 contrasted and tested empirically. We will call
 the first the slack resources theory and the second
 the good management theory.

 Slack resources

 Slack resource theorists argue that better financial
 performance potentially results in the availability
 of slack (financial and other) resources that pro-
 vide the opportunity for companies to invest in
 social performance domains, such as community
 relations, employee relations, or environment
 (e.g., IBM's or Digital Equipment Corporation's
 philanthropy programs during earlier good times).
 If slack resources are available, then better social
 performance would result from the allocation of
 these resources into the social domains, and thus
 better financial performance would be a predictor
 of better CSP. Some of the empirical evidence,
 particularly that of McGuire and colleagues
 (1988, 1990), provides support for the slack
 resources theory.

 Good management

 Good management theorists argue, alternatively,
 that there is a high correlation between good
 management practice, and CSP, simply because
 attention to CSP domains improves relationships
 with key stakeholder groups (e.g. Freeman,

 1984), resulting in better overall performance.
 For example, good employee (including women
 and minorities) relations might be expected to
 enhance morale, productivity, and satisfaction.
 Excellent community relations might provide
 incentives for local government to provide com-
 petition-enhancing tax breaks (e.g., Dayton Hud-
 son's anti-takeover campaign), improved schools
 (and a better workforce over the long term), or
 reduced regulation, thereby reducing costs to the
 firm and improving the bottom line.

 Further, positive customer perceptions about
 the quality and nature of a company's products,
 its environmental awareness, and its government
 and community relations, are increasingly becom-
 ing bases of competition (cf. Prahalad and Hamel,
 1994), blurring the lines between good manage-
 ment practice and 'social' performance. Such
 positive perceptions of the firm by outside stake-
 holders may lead to increased sales or reduced
 stakeholder management costs. The work of
 McGuire and colleagues (1988, 1990) also sup-
 ports the good management theory in that it
 provides empirical support for financial perform-
 ance as the dependent variable.

 Following these latter findings and based on
 McGuire et al. (1990), we hypothesize that CSP
 is both a predictor and consequence of firm fi-
 nancial performance. That is, there is a simul-
 taneous relationship, or a kind of 'virtuous circle',
 such that:

 Hypothesis 1: Better financial performance
 results in improved CSP, ceteris paribus.

 Hypothesis 2: Improved CSP leads to better
 financial performance, ceteris paribus.

 Social-Financial Performance Link 307

 KLD is an independent rating service that focuses
 exclusively on assessment of corporate social per-
 formance across a range of dimensions related to
 stakeholder concerns.

 KLD's rating scheme makes several advances
 beyond those used in earlier research. First, all
 companies in the S&P 500 are rated. Second,
 each company is rated on multiple attributes con-
 sidered relevant to CSP. Third, a single group of
 researchers, working independently from the rated
 companies or any particular brokerage house,
 applies the same set of criteria to related compa-
 nies. Fourth, the criteria are applied consistently
 across a wide range of companies, with data
 gathered from a range of sources, both internal
 and external to the firm.

 As noted, KLD rates companies on eight attri-

 butes of CSP, providing a multidimensional
 assessment. Five of the rated attributes emphasize
 key stakeholder relations that might be included
 among those emphasized as important emerging
 influences on corporate strategy (Prahalad and
 Hamel, 1994), specifically, community relations,
 employee relations, performance with respect to
 the environment, product characteristics, and
 treatment of women and minorities. These five
 are rated on scales ranging from -2 (major
 concerns) to neutral to +2 (major strength). Three
 of the attributes are less directly related to stake-
 holder groups but encompass areas in which com-
 panies have received significant external pressures
 in recent years. These areas are military con-
 tracting, participation in nuclear power, and
 involvement in South Africa (relevant during the
 time period of analysis); these are rated only
 from -2 (major concern) to 0 (neutral) because
 KLD awards no positive assessment of activities
 in these domains.

 In each of the areas, KLD investigates a range
 of sources to determine, for example, whether the
 company has paid fines or penalties in an area
 (for concerns) or has major strengths in the area
 (e.g., strong family policies for the Employee
 Relations category). Appendix 1 provides details
 on the factors used in determining ratings for
 each of the eight categories. Where possible,
 KLD uses quantitative criteria to determine the
 rating (e.g., dollar amount paid in fines or penal-
 ties; percentage of employees receiving certain
 kinds of benefits). Judgement is necessary, of
 course, in the determination of the cutoff point
 for a negative rating, as well as in borderline

 METHOD

 Measuring CSP
 To deal with the measurement problems noted
 above, we constructed an index of CSP (as pro-
 posed by Ullman, 1985), based on the eight
 corporate social performance attributes rated con-
 sistently across the entire Standard and Poors 500
 by the firm Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD).'

 case and in interpretation of qualitative criteria
 (e.g., an excellent employee or community
 relations program). KLD staff members meet on
 a weekly basis to discuss borderline cases and
 assure that decisions on ratings are being made
 in a consistent manner across companies and from
 year to year.

 KLD uses a variety of sources to capture social

 performance data about each company. Each
 company's investor relations office is sent a
 yearly questionnaire about CSP practices and
 KLD maintains continuing relations with investor
 relations offices to assure the accuracy of data.
 KLD maintains the independence and integrity of
 its ratings, but the firm is willing to respond to
 company concerns where accuracy is at issue.
 Corporate data sources include annual reports,
 10K forms, proxy statements, and quarterly
 reports, as well as reports issued for specific
 CSP arenas, such as environment and community.
 External data sources include articles about a
 company in the general business press (e.g. For-
 tune, Business Week, Wall St. Journal), trade
 magazines, and general media. KLD staffers also
 draw on relevant articles on companies from pe-
 riodicals such as the Chronicle of Philanthropy,
 regional Environmental Protection Agency news-
 letters, academic journals, and, for legal or regu-
 latory issues, such as fines and penalties, the
 National Law Journal. External surveys and rat-
 ings are also used, where appropriate, for instance

 nies for women to work for.

 attributes, perform trade-offs among the attributes,
 then construct a scale. Values from 0 to 100
 were derived, representing the relative importance
 of each attribute to the overall index. Normalized
 values were averaged across the panelists and a
 weighted average CSP index was computed for
 each company. A Friedman's nonparametric
 analysis of variance indicated that the ratings of
 each panelist were not significantly different from
 each other. The index developed is statistically
 the same as that used by Ruf, Muralidhar and
 Paul (1993) and reported in Graves and Wad-
 dock (1994).

 We believe that this weighting scheme deals
 with the problem of shifting of the relative impor-
 tance of items in the KLD rating over time and
 with changing social standards (cf. Preston and
 Post, 1975). For example, South Africa, nuclear,
 and military involvement, which carry low weight
 in the index, seem in terms of face validity to
 have relatively less importance to the currently
 emerging construct of CSP than do the more
 stakeholder-oriented measures of community, pro-
 duct, employee relations, diversity (women and
 minority), and environment. The actual weighting
 by our panel of experts reflects this common
 sense.

 Raw CSP data were taken from KLD as of
 1990. For the models that treated CSP as a
 dependent variable, financial data from 1989 were
 used. For the models that treated financial per-
 formance (profitability) as the dependent variable,
 we took profitability in 1991 as the dependent
 variable and used 1990 data for CSP and con-
 trol variables.

 Each attribute in the KLD scheme is implicitly
 given equal weighting, ranging from major con-
 cern (2 X's), concern (1 X), no concern (neutral),
 to strength and major strength. In our weighting
 scheme, major concern was given an index of
 -2, while major strength equaled +2. Because
 experts on CSP consider certain attributes to be
 more important to an overall assessment of CSP
 than others at any given time (Preston and Post,
 1975), the authors developed a panel of three
 experts from the Social Issues in Management
 division of the Academy of Management, who
 had been active in the social issues arena for
 more than 15 years, and asked them to help
 construct an appropriate weighting scheme for
 the index.

 Using the simple multiattribute rating technique
 (SMART) (Von Winterfeldt and Edwards, 1986),
 we asked each panelist to evaluate the eight CSP

 Control variables

 Because size, risk, and industry have been sug-
 gested in previous articles to be factors that affect
 both firm performance and CSP (e.g., Ullman,
 1985), each of these characteristics was oper-
 ationalized as a control variable. Size is a relevant
 variable because there is some evidence that
 smaller firms may not exhibit as many overt
 socially responsible behaviors as do larger firms.
 Perhaps this is the case because as they mature
 and grow, firms attract more attention from exter-
 nal constituents and need to respond more openly
 to stakeholder demands (cf. Burke et al., 1986).
 Management's risk tolerance influences its atti-
 tude toward activities that have the potential to

 (1) elicit savings (e.g., a recycling or waste
 reduction effort, costly at first but potentially
 money saving in the long run, such as 3M Cor-
 poration's Pollution Prevention Pays program; (2)
 incur future or present costs (e.g., pollution con-
 trol equipment that helps avoid future fines), or
 (3) build (environmentally friendly firm) or
 destroy (perceived as unfriendly to certain types
 of people) markets. As a proxy for management's
 risk tolerance, we use the level of debt held by
 the firm.

 Finally, earlier research (Graves and Waddock,
 1994) has shown that clear differences in per-
 formance and levels of R&D investment exist
 among different industries. A quick scan of
 Table 1 suggests that unless the overall differ-
 ences in CSP among industries are controlled for,
 understanding the main effects may blurred, since
 depending on its characteristics, an industry may
 or may not experience significant problems in a
 given social arena. Controlling for industry takes
 these differences into account.

 Firm size was measured by total assets and by

 total sales. As a proxy for the riskiness of a firm,
 we used the long-term debt to total assets ratio.
 Industry was determined by 4-digit SIC (see
 Table 1) and represented in the model by dummy
 variables. All financial data were derived from
 COMPUSTAT tapes.

 Financial performance

 Firm financial performance (profitability) was
 measured using three accounting variables: return

 on assets, return on equity, and return on sales,
 providing a range of measures used to assess
 corporate financial performance by the invest-
 ment community.

 Analysis
 Table 1 gives a listing of the industries, SIC
 codes, and average industry CSP ratings, Table 2
 gives descriptive statistics for all variables used in
 the study, and Table 3 gives the relative weights
 assigned to each CSP attribute. Regression analy-
 sis was used to test our hypotheses, first using
 CSP as the dependent variable, while controlling
 for size (three size measures were used: total
 sales, total assets, and number of employees),
 debt level, and industry, then using profitability
 as the dependent variable and employing the same
 control variables.

 however, when South Africa was still an issue.
 These panelist ratings are consistent with other
 research on stakeholder rankings of the KLD data
 (Ruf et al., 1993; Graves and Waddock, 1994)
 as well as assessments of the validity of the KLD
 rankings compared to other potential measures of
 CSP (e.g., Sharfman, 1993).

 Table 4 provides the correlation matrices for
 the key variables. Table 4(a) shows 1989 financial
 data and 1990 CSP. These data were used for
 the models which treated CSP as the dependent
 variable. Table 4(b) shows correlations between
 1991 profitability (ROA, ROE, ROS) and 1990
 CSP and financial controls. These data were used
 for the models which treated financial perform-
 ance (profitability) as the dependent variable.
 Note first that CSP is positively and significantly
 correlated at p < 0.10 or better with all three of
 the financial performance measures (ROA, return
 on assets; ROE, return on equity; ROS, return
 on sales) for the 1989 financial data, and with
 those measures at the p ' 0.05 level or better
 for the correlations with the 1991 financial data.
 Further, we can see from Table 4 that the three
 financial variables are highly correlated with each
 other (at p < 0.001 for all three variables), as
 would be expected.

 Table 5 presents the results of the regression
 analysis using CSP as the dependent variable and
 financial performance as the independent variable,
 controlling for debt, size, and industry (industry
 controls are omitted from the table in the interest
 of space), using a 1-year lag between the financial
 performance (1989 data) and the CSP measure-
 ment (1990 data). In all nine of these models,
 corporate social performance is the dependent
 variable and measurement of the key independent
 variable, financial performance, varies. Models
 1-3 present the result using ROA as the key
 independent variable and controlling for debt,
 industry, and size (with size measured three ways,
 yielding the different models).

 As can be seen (Table 5), each of the models

 RESULTS

 A total of 469 companies remained in the sample
 after companies missing either financial or CSP
 data were eliminated. As can be seen in Table 1,
 there are considerable differences in the ratings
 among industries, with the lowest CSP rated
 industry being refining, rubber, and plastic (SIC
 2891-3199) at -0.52. Other heavy manufacturing
 and extraction industries (e.g., mining, construc-
 tion at -0.22, chemicals and pharmaceuticals at
 -0.15 and containers, steel, and heavy manufac-
 turing at -0.14) also rated considerably lower
 than less manufacturing-intensive industries,
 which scored much higher on the CSP rating
 (e.g., banking and financial services at 0.13 and
 wholesaling and retailing at 0.11). Note from
 Table 1 that most industries (9 out of 13) were
 rated below 0 on the overall CSP scoring and
 that only those industries not engaged in activities
 as likely to have significant CSP consequences
 (e.g., environmental impact or community,
 employee, and product-related issues) were rated
 positively on overall CSP. These descriptive
 results indicate the importance of controlling for
 industry in the assessment of the relationship
 between financial and CSP performance.

 Table 3 shows the panel's weighting of the

 CSP attributes in the KLD data base. As can
 be seen, employee relations, product, community
 relations, environment, and treatment of women
 and minorities (now called diversity) were con-
 sidered more important than the three issues of
 nuclear power, military contracts, and South
 Africa, which today would likely not be con-
 sidered important at all. The data are from 1990,

 strongly related to the ROA at p < 0.001 for all
 the models as well. The results are less strong,
 but still significant at p < 0.10 when the financial

 p < 0.05 when the independent financial variable
 is return on sales (Models 7-9). These results
 strongly support Hypothesis 1, which posits that

 better financial performance leads to improved
 CSP. CSP is negatively related to debt-to-asset
 ratio in each of the first nine models, but is only
 significant (p < 0.10) when ROE is used. Size
 shows no significant relationship in any of these
 models; its sign is negative in all but two
 instances.

 Our second hypothesis proposed that improved
 CSP results in improved financial performance.
 Using a 1-year lag for financial performance
 (1991 data) and the 1990 CSP data (and 1990
 financial control variables), we performed a set
 of regression analyses using the financial perform-
 ance variables, ROA, ROE, and ROS as the
 dependent variables and CSP as the independent
 variable, while again controlling for debt, size
 (measured three ways), and industry. As can be
 seen (Table 6), the results generally support the
 hypothesis that financial performance depends on
 CSP. In the ROA models (Models 1-3) there is
 a significant relationship between ROA and CSP
 (p< 0.01) when size is measured by sales;
 p < 0.001 when size is measured by total assets;

 and p < 0.01 when size is measured by number
 of employees.

 When profitability is measured by ROE, the

 relationship, while in the same direction, is not
 significant (Models 4-6); however, when the
 financial variable ROS is used, each model is
 significant at the p < 0.05 level (Models 7-9).
 In these models there is a consistently negative
 and significant relationship between debt-to-asset
 ratio and CSP. The size effect is significantly
 negative in the first three models, and negative
 in all but two cases.

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

 This study has attempted to address what has
 become a perennial question: whether corporate
 social performance is linked to financial perform-
 ance and, if so, in what direction the causation
 runs. In undertaking the study, we are exploring
 whether or not strategic linkages exist between
 CSP behaviors and financial performance. Using

 a greatly improved source of CSP assessment,
 we evaluated the linkage between financial and
 social performance when CSP was both a depen-
 dent and independent variable. Our data set
 included most the S&P 500 firms.

 In support of those studies that have found
 positive linkages in the past (e.g., Cochran and
 Wood, 1984; McGuire et al., 1988, 1990; Aup-
 perle et al., 1985), we found, using this improved
 measure, that CSP does depend on financial per-

 formance and that the sign of the relationship is
 positive. That is, in support of the slack resources
 theory, firms with slack resources potentially
 available from strong financial performance may
 have greater freedom to invest in positive CSP.
 Thus, it may well be that firms with available
 resources may choose to spend those resources
 on 'doing good by doing well', and that those
 resource allocations may result in improved
 CSP overall.

 Clearly, firms that are in financial trouble may

 have little ability to make discretionary invest-
 ments in traditional CSP activities such as phil-
 anthropy, while those doing well financially have
 resources to spend in ways that may have more
 long-term strategic impacts, such as investments
 in improved local schools or community con-
 ditions to improve a workforce. Such resource
 allocations may be strategically linked to
 improvements in long-term image and relation-

 ships with the communities with which it must
 interact. If, as will be discussed below, CSP is
 redefined to encompass critical stakeholder
 relations, as the measure used in the present study
 does, then expenditures on CSP activities are far
 from discretionary and may actually be strategic
 because they encompass daily corporate life.

 relationship) that financial performance also
 depends on good social performance, suggesting

 Further, we found (in a kind of simultaneous

 that there is something about performing well in
 social arenas that may be simply linked to good
 managerial practice. Thus, in support of what we
 termed the 'good management theory', firms may
 also 'do well by doing good', to turn the phrase
 used above. This finding provides support for
 researchers using the Fortune reputational index
 in the past (McGuire et al., 1988, 1990; O'Ban-
 non and Preston, 1993), who have implicitly sug-
 gested that there may be a linkage between good
 management and good social performance.

 Alternatively, the positive finding may rep-
 resent (at least initially) simple 'posturing' on
 the part of companies to improve their external
 reputations, possibly boost employee morale, and
 improve investor relations, and hence may not be
 real at all. According to this explanation, good
 managers may not be fully committed to
 improved CSP, but they may recognize that cer-
 tain benefits may be gained by appearing to
 support social performance goals. Such managers
 might pursue social performance goals just
 enough to avoid significant bad publicity, but
 may do so at a minimum investment. Although
 this possibility is somewhat obviated by the
 higher weights on the key stakeholder relation-
 ships encompassed by the CSP measure, it does
 remain a possibility until these relationships are
 explored in more depth.

 Although the comprehensiveness of the KLD

 data on CSP mitigate somewhat the posturing
 hypothesis because the data are gathered across
 such a wide range of activities and behaviors, it is
 entirely possible firms wishing to appear socially
 responsible will initially engage in posturing
 behaviors only to find that over time, they have
 actually institutionalized cultural or strategic
 changes in what Mintzberg (1987) has termed
 emergent strategy. We can speculate, for example,
 that CSP expenditures, whether derived from real
 strategic intent or posturing behaviors, may, once
 implemented, result in actual improved attention
 to key external and internal stakeholders, such as
 customers (via products that meet real needs),
 communities and the environment, or employees,
 including women and minorities. Alternatively,
 they may provide benefits beyond their costs that
 are eventually reflected in financial performance.
 Our findings indicate minimally that attention

 to CSP arenas does not represent a competitive
 disadvantage and may in fact be a competitive
 advantage. If, for example, better performance
 along CSP dimensions allows companies to attract
 better employees more easily, forego difficult and
 costly battles for site placement with communities
 or governmental officials, or avoid payments of
 fines for environmental problems, then potentially
 we are changing the definition of CSP so that it
 no longer represents a discretionary activity on
 the part of management (Carroll, 1979), but is
 fundamentally linked to management performance
 itself. Thus, stakeholder relations are corporate
 social performance in this new definition and

 A virtuous circle?

 As we consider the relationship between the first
 and second hypothesis, we can begin to speculate
 that wherever the cycle begins, whether in an
 initial availability of slack resources or in initial
 attention to the social performance dimensions,
 there may be a simultaneous and interactive
 impact, possibly forming what we earlier termed
 a virtuous circle. The impact appears to be posi-
 tive: better CSP, based on these findings, seems
 to be positively related to better financial per-
 formance, whichever measure we choose as the
 dependent variable. We interpret this finding to
 mean that causation may run in both directions.
 That is, better financial performance may lead to
 improved CSP. Also, better CSP may lead to
 improved financial performance, ceteris paribus.
 The first finding, if upheld in future research,
 would be explained by the slack resources theory.
 The second finding is somewhat more difficult
 to explain. At this point in the research, we can
 forward only tentative, yet plausible, explanations.
 First, meeting stakeholder expectations in advance
 of their becoming problematic may simply reflect
 proactive attention to domains that others
 (Prahalad and Hamel, 1994) have recognized as
 becoming increasingly important. Such concerns
 reflect a variety of stakeholder interests, thereby
 aligning stakeholder interests more closely to the
 very definition of CSP than previous research has
 done and making these stakeholder relations more
 prominent in the link to financial performance.
 Importantly, the heavier weights in the CSP index
 are those that most closely represent critical
 stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and
 community, while less directly stakeholder-related
 categories of involvement in nuclear industries,
 military contracting, or South Africa receive con-
 siderably less weight.

 expenditures in key stakeholder domains become
 an important element of improved corporate per-
 formance as well as improved CSP.

 It is thus entirely possible that there are direct
 linkages between the overall quality of manage-
 ment and CSP, with the clear implication that
 good CSP and good management may be one
 and the same thing if CSP is measured and
 defined properly, that is, if CSP is defined in
 terms of stakeholder relations considered critical
 to firm performance and not as simply discretion-
 ary activities, such as philanthropy or corporate
 volunteerism. Even if CSP and quality of manage-
 ment can be differentiated, the meaning-making
 that goes with creating strong social performance
 may elicit greater loyalty to firms from two
 important constituencies: employees and cus-
 tomers, while simultaneously providing at least
 certain categories of owners (i.e., those with
 social concerns) even more reason to invest in a
 particular firm.

 The data used in this study support that latter
 notion, indicating that it may pay to give attention
 to dimensions of management that are normally
 outside of strict financial, productivity, and
 efficiency considerations. The components of the
 CSP index encompass a range of social concerns
 not always considered central strategic issues,
 but which can now be considered important to
 performance (cf. Prahalad and Hamel, 1994),
 when factors such as company size, industry, and
 debt (or risk) level are taken into account. That
 is, good management and its reflection in financial
 outcomes may also encompass the nature of prod-
 ucts produced, a company's posture with respect
 to the natural environment, its relations to
 employees, including women and minorities, and
 its community relations, among others.

 Implications for future research

 Much remains to be learned about the relationship
 between CSP and financial performance, which
 has been explored in the present study. For
 example, as more CSP data become available it
 would be useful to determine whether or not
 the relationships that we have examined hold
 consistently over time. Additionally, it would be
 useful to examine lags other than the 1-year time
 period used in the present study. Further, if qual-
 ity of management is a critical variable in finan-
 cial outcomes, as the relationships identified in

 Social-Financial Performance Link 315

 this study suggest, then controlling for the quality
 of management while assessing the CSP-financial
 performance link might also be beneficial. Such
 an approach would incorporate financial perform-
 ance as part of the measure of CSP, by recogniz-
 ing that financial/market performance implicitly
 measures treatment of a key stakeholder, the
 owner. Although, additional research is clearly
 necessary to explore these specific relationships
 between the stakeholder categories and financial
 performance, the findings here are suggestive of
 the need to alter current definitions of CSP to
 bring them more closely into line with stakeholder
 relations (cf. Wood and Jones, 1995; Waddock,
 1996) as the weighted index does.

 Implications for management

 As strategic managers consider where to place
 their investments, they may wish to take into
 account the results reported above. This study
 suggests that there is no detrimental impact or
 penalty from allocating some resources towards
 corporate social performance (as has also been
 recognized in earlier research, e.g., Graves and
 Waddock, 1994). In fact, it would seem that such
 investments might be beneficial, especially if they
 improve key stakeholder relations.

 This research indicates that good CSP may go
 beyond simple 'good deeds' in excess of normal
 strategic activity to encompass a panoply of
 stakeholder relations, simply because we have
 used a broader measure of CSP than has tradition-
 ally been used in the past and because our meas-
 ure does both encompass and highly weight these
 stakeholders' concerns. Typically single-dimen-
 sion, narrow measures (for example, philanthropic
 contributions, corporate volunteer records, build-
 ing pollution control devices in excess of man-
 date, or the building of day care centers) have
 been used to assess CSP on the assumption that
 CSP is discretionary activity above and beyond
 required daily activities. Thus, prior CSP research
 has been undertaken with an assumption that CSP
 is an extra activity, an add-on to normal strategic
 and management decision making, with reference
 to the normal activities of corporate life (see
 Carroll, 1979, 1995 for an articulation of this
 type of framing of CSP). The present research
 indicates that poor performance in primary stake-
 holder domains, including environmental pollution
 (measured by fines), poor labor relations, prob-

 lematic products, and so on, may have significant
 deleterious impacts on firm financial performance,
 thus linking CSP-stakeholder relations more
 tightly and simultaneously allowing more in-depth
 exploration of the link to financial performance
 than has been possible with more limited data
 bases in the past.

 Managers and scholars arguably need to

 broaden their understanding of the term corporate
 social performance to encompass the ongoing
 nature of activities of a firm with respect to key
 stakeholders. If good management theory and the
 virtuous circle hold, as this research begins to
 suggest, then CSP involves more than doing the
 extras: it is a way of doing business. It may be
 true that firms with available resources sometimes
 go beyond minimum expectations of good man-
 agement to achieve sound stakeholder relations
 by investing in extras that are traditionally asso-
 ciated with the slack-resources view of CSP.
 Nonetheless, if strong performance is to continue,
 strategic managers must focus increasingly on the
 concerns of all stakeholders.
