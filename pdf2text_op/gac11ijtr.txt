ABSTRACT

The examination of the possible direct link 
between environmental protection and ﬁ rm 
performance has generally produced mixed 
results. This paper contributes to the 
literature by considering the antecedents of 
hotel managers’ environmental attitudes to 
check whether perceptions of the external 
and internal factors are behind the adoption 
of a proactive environmental management. 
The study also tests whether or not the 
resource-based view of the hotel mediates 
the positive relationships of proactive 
environmental management and improved 
environmental performance with 
competitive advantage and ﬁ nancial 
performance. This contribution is original 
because this study develops a 
comprehensive whole picture of this path 
process, which has previously only been 
partially discussed in the literature.

INTRODUCTION

Tourism  is  an  industry  that  depends  on 

the  natural  environment  (Curtin  and 
Busby, 1999). Recent research has empha-
sized  the  importance  of  the  environment  for 
tourism  activity  and  development  (Chan  and 
Wong, 2006; Butler, 2008). It has also been con-
cerned  with  the  impacts  that  tourism  has  on 
natural resources (Claver et al., 2007; Shunnaq 
et al., 2008). In the last United Nations Climate 
Change  Conference  held  in  Copenhagen  in 
December 2009, it has been told that the role of 
tourism in the generation or control of green-
house  gases  is  highly  relevant.  If  global 
warming  takes  place  as  it  is  forecast,  at  the 
very least, winter sports holidays, island holi-
days and beach and sun holidays will be under 
massive  pressure.  Certainly  it  will  mean  that 
the  geography  of  the  tourism  industry  will 
change dramatically (UNFCCC, 2010).

In  this  context,  environmental  factors  have 
gained  major  importance  (Curtin  and  Busby, 
1999). An important question is what determines 
hotels’  environmental  activities  and  commit-
ment? Previous research across a range of disci-
plines  has  attempted  to  identify  forces  that 
motivate  and  encourage  ﬁ rms  to  respond  to 
environmental  issues  (Aragón-Correa  et  al., 
2004).  Stakeholders  (such  as  customers,  local

interest  groups),  environmental  legislation  and 
the  availability  of  resources  and  capabilities  to 
implement  a  proactive  environmental  manage-
ment1  are  considered  relevant  forces  that  affect 
environmental  decision-making  and  actions 
(Banerjee et al., 2003). Some research has pointed 
out  that  there  are  links  between  top  manage-
ment’s  perceptions  of  environmental  issues  as 
threats  or  opportunities  and  choice  of  environ-
mental management, so that a positive relation-

perceptions of environmental issues as opportu-

management  (Sharma,  2000).  In  this  respect, 
managerial perceptions of environmental issues 
can  reﬂ ect  both  external  and  internal  driving 
forces that affect environmental decision-making 
and these forces may be considered in order to 
adopt environmental management strategy.

exists  between 

The  hotel  industry  has  been  traditionally 
considered  one  that  does  not  have  a  great 
impact on the natural environment compared 
to manufacturing industry. However, it gener-
ates  much  more  negative  environmental 
impacts  that  the  public  perceives,  consuming 
a  vast  amount  of  local  and  imported  non-
durable  goods,  energy  and  water,  as  well  as 
emitting  a  large  amount  of  carbon  dioxide 
(Bohdanowicz, 2006). As an emerging strategy, 
environmental  management  has  increased  its 
attraction by hotel managers because it encom-
passes the technical and organizational activi-
ties  undertaken  by  the  organization  for  the 
purpose  of  reducing  these  environmental 
impacts  and  minimizing  their  effects  on  the 
natural environment (Cramer, 1998).

Financial  performance  has  been  considered 
one of the most visible advantages coming from 
proactive  environmental  management  and 
improved  environmental  performance.  Previ-
ous  literature  has  underlined  ﬁ nancial  perfor-

ment,  methods  and  procedures  used  at  the  production, 
product  design  and  product  distribution  mechanisms 
which  save  energy  and  natural  resources,  minimize  the 
environmental  problems  generated  by  human  activities 
and protect the natural environment’ (Shrivastava, 1995). 
Proactive environmental management has been delimited 
as  systematic  patterns  of  voluntary  practices  that  go 
beyond regulatory requirements, for instance in terms of 
waste  reduction  and  prevention  of  pollution  at  source 
(Aragón-Correa and Rubio-López, 2007).’

mance of proactive environmental management 
as one of the main drivers of going green, and 
related environmental organizations have pro-
vided quantitative evidence of cost and differ-
entiation  advantages.  Bohdanowicz 
(2005) 
suggests  that  the  most  signiﬁ cant  beneﬁ ts  are 
reduction  of  operating  costs,  demands  from 
customers and improved hotel image.

On  the  basis  of  the  ideas  discussed  above, 
our study contributes to the literature because 
we offer an analysis, based on a single frame-
work, of the inﬂ uence that some external and 
internal factors exert on managerial perception 
about  the  natural  environment  as  a  competi-
tive  opportunity,  and  additionally,  about  the 
effect  that  this  managerial  perception  has  on 
the  adoption  of  superior  proactive  environ-
mental management schemes. We also analyse 
the impact that proactive environmental man-
agement  has  on  environmental  performance, 
and  the  effect  that  these  environmental  vari-
ables  have  on  competitive  advantage  and 
ﬁ nancial  performance  through  the  resource-
based view. We examine all these relationships 
within  the  same  structural  equation  model. 
Therefore, our proposal is original in explicitly 
stating  and  testing  the  path  process  between 
the different variables in our model. Although 
this path process is implicit in many previous 
works  (and  partially  discussed  in  some  theo-
retical papers), we offer a whole picture.

Finally,  research  about  a  ﬁ rm’s  response  to 
environmental concerns has mainly focused on 
the manufacturing industry. Service ﬁ rms have 
been slower in taking positive action in envi-
ronmental  matters  and  have  consequently 
attracted much less research attention (Álvarez 
et al., 2001; Ayuso, 2006). This is the case for the 
tourism industry. Our research is a step in the 
direction towards better understanding of the 
peculiarities  of  the  hotel  industry  regarding 
environmental protection. A number of reasons 
justify our choice. For example, we selected the 
tourism  industry,  and  more  speciﬁ cally  the 
hotel industry, because of the relevance that this 
area of activity has for Spain’s socio-economic 
structure. The tourism industry was directly or 
indirectly responsible for the generation of 11% 
of the country’s gross domestic product in 2005 
(INE, 2006) — and additionally, of 15% of the 
employment created within the service indus-
try  (National  Statistics  Institute  Information

Bulletin,  2005) — which  conﬁ gured  it  as  the 
ﬁ rst  productive  industry  in  Spain.  Moreover, 
the  tourism  industry  is  dependent  on  the 
natural environment as the basis for the tourism 
product  itself.  Shunnaq  et  al.  (2008)  highlight 
the dilemma faced by tourism organizations as 
there is a need to protect the environment both 
for tourism and from tourism. Another reason 
is the possibility of conceiving new ideas about 
the link between tourism development and the 
different  sustainability  dimensions  (environ-
ment, society and economy). In fact, we view 
‘sustainable tourism’ as the development of a 
tourist product that is more respectful of — or 
less harmful to — the environment and which 
at the same time, can offer a competitive advan-
tage in the tourism market and ensure its long-
term economic viability (Ayuso, 2006).

This  paper  has  the  following  structure. 
Firstly, we offer a literature review followed by 
a presentation of the research design. Next, we 
show the ﬁ ndings based on a structural equa-
tion  model  for  the  hotel  industry  in  Spain. 
Then, we discuss these ﬁ ndings, present some 
managerial  implications  and  summarizes  the 
main conclusions.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES

The relationship between internal and 
external factors and managerial perception
Environmental behaviour of ﬁ rms depends on 
some  internal  and  some  external  forces  (Fraj-
Andrés et al., 2008). These forces may inﬂ uence 
the handling of an organization’s environmen-
tal  concerns  but  do  not  homogenize  environ-
mental  commitment  across  the  organizations 
within  a  given  context.  Managers  who  are 
accountable  for  an  aspect  of  organizational 
functioning  therefore  have  opportunities  to 
inﬂ uence  the  commitment  of  their  organiza-
tion,  even  in  the  environmental  area,  where 
external  pressures  (e.g.  new  environmental 
laws)  are  numerous  and  sometimes  strong 
(Aragón-Correa  et  al.,  2004;  Bohdanowicz, 
2005).  Managers  signiﬁ cantly  inﬂ uence  the 
environmental  commitment  of  their  ﬁ rms 
through  their  interpretations,  preferences  or 
decisions, which depend on the possibility of 
gaining competitive advantage associated with 
environmental actions (Miles and Covin, 2000).

Environmental  regulations  have  been  the 
main driving force behind managerial percep-
tion (Banerjee et al., 2003). A number of authors 
have actually argued that coercive forces could 
drive  ﬁ rms  towards  more  proactive  environ-
mental  strategies  through  the  possibility  of 
avoiding some of the potential costs and legal 
liabilities inherent in coercive green forces, to 
pre-empt  more  extensive  and  stringent  coer-
cive  regulations  and  to  minimize  the  uncer-
tainty  that  is  characteristic  of  government 
approaches  (Clemens  and  Douglas,  2006). 
Rivera  and  Molero  (2006)  identify  a  positive 
relationship  between  legislative  environmen-
tal  pressure  and  managerial  perception  that 
can  help  design  environmental  management 
as  a  competitive  opportunity.  These  results 
lead us to hypothesize the following:

Hypothesis 1: The environmental legisla-
tion  exerts  a  positive  inﬂ uence  on  the 
manager’s perception about the environ-
ment as a competitive opportunity.

Stakeholders may inﬂ uence managerial percep-
tion by means of two instruments: pressure and 
cooperation. The pressure exerted by stakehold-
ers  on  managers  is  increasingly  intense.  Pres-
sure may separate the ﬁ rm from the rest of the 
society, thus leading to a worsening reputation, 
to  increased  costs  and  to  a  reduction  of  the 
shareholder value because of the erosion of the 
license  to  act  (Hill,  2001).  Therefore,  presum-
ably, the stronger the pressure exerted by stake-
holders, the greater the interest of managers in 
protecting the environment.

In turn, all this pressure pushes the ﬁ rm to 
include an ability to develop collaborative rela-
tionships with stakeholders for the purpose of 
ﬁ nding  solutions  to  environmental  problems 
(Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Sharma et al. 
(2007)  indicate  that  managers  can  positively 
value  the  potential  competitive  opportunities 
derived  from  the  dialogue  with  their  stake-
holders, as the latter will bring new ideas and 
knowledge  likely  to  favour  an  anticipating, 
preventive and innovative attitude within the 
organization. Thus, ﬁ rms with managers who 
view the wide variety of their stakeholders as 
important will probably pay more attention to 
the  development  of  proactive  environmental 
strategies than those who focus on narrow sets

(Buysse  and  Verbeke,  2003).  In  that  case,  we 
can state the following two hypotheses:

Hypothesis  2a:  A  stronger  pressure 
exerted  by  stakeholders  on  the  ﬁ rm  has 
a  positive  impact  on  the  perception  of 
managers  about  the  environment  as  a 
competitive opportunity.
Hypothesis 2b: A greater collaboration of 
stakeholders with the ﬁ rm has a positive 
impact  on  the  perception  of  managers 
about  the  environment  as  a  competitive 
opportunity.

Managers’  perception  of 
environmental 
responsibility  as  a  competitive  opportunity 
also  depends  on  the  availability  of  comple-
mentary  resources  and  capabilities  already 
owned by the ﬁ rm (Hart, 1995; Aragón-Correa, 
1998;  Christmann,  2000;  Aragón-Correa  and 
Sharma, 2003). Nakamura et al. (2001) indicate 
that  resources  and  capabilities  facilitate  ﬁ rm 
adaptation  of  these  resources  thus  reducing 
the costs of accommodating it to new environ-
mental requirements. This may contribute to a 
positive  perception  of  managers  about  the 
environment  as  a  competitive  opportunity. 
The  reason  is  that  these  resources  favour  the 
adoption  of  practices  with  more  aggressive 
environmental goals, extending them to skills 
related to pollution proactive (Rondinelli and 
Vastag, 2000). Additionally, these ﬁ rms will be 
able to achieve greater environmental improve-
ments because they can make a more efﬁ cient 
use  of  their  internal  experience  and  obtain 
constant  improvements  thus  enhancing  their 
organizational  efﬁ ciency  (Christmann,  2000). 
These arguments lead to another hypothesis:

Hypothesis  3:  The 
complementary 
resources and capabilities available to the 
ﬁ rm  positively  inﬂ uence  the  perception 
of managers about the environment as a 
competitive opportunity.

The relationship between managerial 
perception, resources and capabilities and 
proactive environmental management
Managerial  perceptions  about  the  characteris-
tics of the environment inﬂ uence the extent to

which  managers  will  generate  proactive  envi-
ronmental  strategies  (Sharma  et  al.,  2007). 
Sharma  (2000)  shows  that  managers  exercise 
strategic choice by undertaking environmental 
management schemes, which relate to manage-
rial  interpretations  of  environmental  issues  as 
threats or as opportunities (Sharma et al., 1999).
Some  internal  resources  and  capabilities 
equally affect the environmental management 
adopted  within  the  ﬁ rm  (Zhu  et  al.,  2008). 
These  resources  vary  radically  depending  on 
whether or not that ﬁ rm goes beyond compli-
ance  to  embrace  proactive  pollution  (Russo 
and Fouts, 1997). In addition, it also depends 
on  how  managers  accept  their  leadership 
responsibilities to deﬁ ne environmental behav-
iour  and  to  pursue  it  relentlessly  as  a  top-
priority  goal  (Thomas  et  al.,  2004).  Thus,  the 
passive accommodating or proactive environ-
mental attitude of managers and the available 
resources  in  the  ﬁ rm  are  signiﬁ cant  factors 
shaping  a  ﬁ rm’s  environmental  orientation. 
When the manager has a passive or accommo-
dating  attitude,  the  ﬁ rm  adopts  end-of-pipe 
technologies. Instead, when the manager has a 
proactive  attitude,  the  ﬁ rm  introduces  proac-
tive technologies that can reduce pollution to 
a greater extent or even remove it completely 
from the productive process, as a result of the 
investments made in clean technologies. Shifts 
from  a  reactive  approach  towards  pollution 
proactive  require  substantial  resource  alloca-
tions in multiple domains, for example, invest-
ments  in  green  products  and  manufacturing 
technologies,  in  employee  skills  and  in  the 
reconﬁ guration  of 
the  strategic  planning 
process  (Russo  and  Fouts,  1997;  Buysse  and 
Verbeke,  2003).  All  these  arguments  lead  to 
another two hypotheses:

Hypothesis  4:  The  higher  the  degree  to 
which the manager sees the natural envi-
ronment  as  a  competitive  opportunity, 
the higher the likelihood of developing a 
proactive  environmental  management 
scheme.
Hypothesis 5: The greater the availability 
of  complementary  resources  and  capa-
bilities 
in  the  ﬁ rm,  the  higher  the 
likelihood of developing a proactive envi-
ronmental management scheme.

Managers’ Perceptions, Environmental Management and Firm Performance

Environmental protection and 
ﬁ rm performance
Environmental  management  and  environmental 
performance.  The  environmental  management 
literature has shown that the adoption of envi-
ronmental practices by ﬁ rms typically leads to 
or has to do with good environmental perfor-
mance (e.g. Zhu and Sarkis, 2004).

Better  environmental  performance  levels 
can be derived from different types of environ-
mental  practices  that  do  not  always  have  the 
same  effects  on  environmental  performance. 
Environmental performance relates to end-of-
pipe  and  pollution  proactive  environmental 
management.  One  would  expect  an  end-of-
pipe  environmental  management  to  favour 
improvement, mainly in the undesired outputs 
of production processes, such as emissions into 
the air and into the water, which result in few 
positive effects on environmental performance 
(Schaltegger and Figge, 2000). By contrast, efﬁ -
ciency  improvements  brought  about  by  inte-
grating  a  proactive  stance  on  pollution  can 
encompass activities such as improvements in 
the  ﬁ rm’s  energy-use  or  water-use  efﬁ ciency, 
or  increased  resource  efﬁ ciency — that  is, 
reduced amounts of production input per unit 
of  product  output  (Wagner,  2005).  Therefore, 
the effect of proactive environmental manage-
ment  on  environmental  performance  should 
be more positive than of end-of-pipe activities, 
although  both  of  them  reduce  emissions. 
Wagner (2005) demonstrates that high levels of 
ﬁ rm performance coincide with high levels of 
environmental  performance  only  if  the  ﬁ rm’s 
environmental  management  technology  has 
a  pollution  proactive  orientation.  All  the 
above-mentioned  hypotheses  lead  to  another 
hypothesis:

Hypothesis  6:  A  positive  relationship 
exists  between  proactive  environmental 
management  and  environmental  perfor-
mance improvement.

role of mediating variables. Firm resources and 
competitive advantage may play an important 
role.

The contribution of proactive environmental 
management  to  competitive  advantage  is  in 
terms  of  costs  and  differentiation  (González-
Benito  and  González-Benito,  2005;  Galdeano-
Gómez  et  al.,  2008).  Decisions  such  as  the 
purchase of a new green technology, the consid-
eration of greener distribution and transporta-
tion systems, or the eco-design of products and 
processes  will  allow  ﬁ rms  to  gain  competitive 
advantages derived from cost reductions (Fraj-
Andrés et al., 2008). Christmann (2000) provides 
evidence  showing  that  the  higher  the  ﬁ rm’s 
level of innovation in pollution proactive tech-
nologies,  the  larger  the  cost  advantage  it  will 
gain from environmental strategies. Differentia-
tion advantages typically arise from the percep-
tion on the part of customers that the product 
is  more  valuable  (Bohdanowicz,  2005).  Thus, 
differentiation  advantages  usually  depend  on 
the  ﬁ t  of  product  characteristics  and  market 
needs  and  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  ability  to  market  the 
environmental characteristics of their products 
and services (Galdeano-Gómez et al., 2008).

In  this  relationship,  ﬁ rm  resources  should 
be  considered  as  a  mediator  variable.  Firm 
resources  have  been  the  output  of  proactive 
environmental  management  strategies  (e.g. 
continuous innovation or stakeholder manage-
ment) and social reputation and legitimization 
(Dinan, 2000; Aragón-Correa and Rubio-López, 
2007).  Aragón-Correa  and  Sharma  (2003), 
Christmann  (2000),  Sharma  and  Vredenburg 
(1998)  and  Wagner  (2005)  identify  the  impor-
tance  of  developing  superior  ﬁ rm  resources 
based  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  relationship  with  the 
natural environment as a source of competitive 
advantage.  For  instance,  Miles  and  Covin 
(2000) indicate that a ﬁ rm’s advantage in repu-
tation  is  bound  to  favour  a  more  proﬁ table 
exploitation  of  marketing  opportunities,  and 
thus,  increase  market  value.  We  suggest  the 
next two hypotheses:

Environmental  protection  and  competitive  advan-
tage through the resource-based view. The impact 
of environmental variables on ﬁ nancial perfor-
mance may not be an immediate one. Thus, it 
is important to analyse the causal relationships 
between  different  variables,  considering  the 

Hypothesis 7a: The ﬁ rm resources gener-
ated  through  proactive  environmental 
management  mediate  the  positive  rela-
tionship between proactive environmen-
tal  management  and  cost  competitive 
advantage.

Hypothesis 7b: The ﬁ rm resources gener-
ated  through  proactive  environmental 
management  mediate  the  positive  rela-
tionship between proactive environmen-
tal  management  and  differentiation 
competitive advantage.

Other  studies  have  analysed  the  relationship 
between  environmental  performance  and  com-
petitive  advantage.  For  example,  Wagner  and 
Schaltegger (2004) explain that the reduction of 
environmental impact has a signiﬁ cant and posi-
tive inﬂ uence on environmental competitiveness 
dimensions (market-, internal-, proﬁ tability- and 
risk-related environmental competitiveness).

In this relationship, ﬁ rm resources should be 
considered  as  a  mediator  variable.  Environ-
mental  performance  encourages  the  develop-
ment of new ﬁ rm resources. Konar and Cohen 
(2001) extend the standard economic technique 
of decomposing a ﬁ rm’s market value into its 
tangible  and  intangible  assets,  by  separating 
out environmental performance for intangible 
assets  of  the  ﬁ rm.  Their  key  ﬁ nding  is  that 
there  is  a  signiﬁ cant  positive  relationship 
between  environmental  performance  and  the 
intangible  asset  value.  Moreover,  these  assets 
may improve the competitiveness of the ﬁ rm 
(López-Gamero  et  al.,  2009).  Firms  with  very 
low  manufacturing  emissions  with  respect  to 
their  competitors  may  be  able  to  gain  a  ﬁ rst-
mover advantage after improving their green 
image  in  emerging  green  product  markets 
(Roy,  1999).  In  the  light  of  the  reasons  men-
tioned, we propose the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 8a: The ﬁ rm resources gener-
ated  through  proactive  environmental 
management  mediate  the  positive  rela-
tionship  between  environmental  perfor-
mance improvement and cost competitive 
advantage.
Hypothesis 8b: The ﬁ rm resources gener-
ated  through  proactive  environmental 
management  mediate  the  positive  rela-
tionship  between  environmental  perfor-
mance  improvement  and  differentiation 
competitive advantage.

Competitive advantage and ﬁ nancial performance. 
Although  there  are  many  other  variables

involved,  the  ultimate  consequence  of  any 
competitive  advantage  deriving  from  proac-
tive  environmental  management  will  most 
probably be an improvement in ﬁ nancial per-
formance  (González-Benito  and  González-
Benito,  2005).  Improving  their  environmental 
performance  allows  ﬁ rms  to  enhance  their 
competitive  edge  in  terms  of  reducing  costs, 
gaining a strong reputation among customers 
and  increasing  their  competitiveness  in  inter-
national markets. These beneﬁ ts may, in turn, 
positively  impact  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  overall  ﬁ nan-
cial  performance  (Lindell  and  Karagozoglu, 
2001).  Thus,  the  following  hypotheses  can  be 
advanced:

Hypothesis  9a:  Cost  competitive  advan-
tage  has  a  positive  effect  on  ﬁ nancial 
performance.
Hypothesis  9b:  Differentiation  competi-
tive  advantage  has  a  positive  effect  on 
ﬁ nancial performance.

Figure 1 shows our proposed model and the 

hypotheses.

METHODS

Sample and data collection
The population was made up of 3900 three-to-
ﬁ ve-star  Spanish 
individual  hotels  which 
appeared in the Ofﬁ cial Hotel Guide published 
by  Turespaña  in  September  2004.  These  cate-
gories  corresponded  to  establishments  with 
more  possibilities  to  apply  environmental 
practices.  A  structured  questionnaire  with 
closed questions was sent by post to the hotel 
managers. The cover letter and the instructions 
indicated  that  an  environment  manager — 
or  otherwise  someone  familiar  with  these 
issues — should  answer  the  questionnaire. 
The interviewee could ﬁ ll in the questionnaire 
on  a  web  page  too.  We  sent  four  reminder 
emails  during  the  four  weeks  following  the 
initial  mailing  so  as  to  encourage  response. 
Moreover,  we  made  follow-up  phone  calls 
starting  two  weeks  later.  Two  hundred  forty 
hotels  sent  their  responses,  a  response  rate

The thick solid lines indicate the relationships established as a hypothesis in the model; the thin solid lines indicate the relationship between the 
control variable and the variables which constitute the link between environmental protection and firm performance; finally, the dotted lines 
indicate  all  those  relationships  which  we  also  introduced  into  the  structural  equation  model  for  the  purpose  of  checking  that statistically 
significant relationships exist between the variables they link.
Variables = SIZE (control variable): ln (employees); LEG: environmental legislation; STAKE: stakeholders; R&C: complementary resources 
and capabilities; MAN: managerial perceptions about the natural environment as a competitive opportunity; EM: environmental management; 
ENP:  environmental  performance;  NERAC:  new  resources  and  capabilities;  CAC:  competitive  advantages  on  costs;  CAD:  competitive 
advantages in differentiation; FP: financial performance.

targeted,  is  relatively  good  and  in  keeping 
with those obtained by other researchers who 
have  studied  similar  organizational  phenom-
ena  in  Spain  (Brío  and  Junquera  2001;  Brío 
et al. 2002; Carmona-Moreno et al. 2004).

Prior to this, there was a pre-test stage which 
involved 10 hotel managers and four research-
ers  specialized  in  hospitality  management. 
This pre-test stage helped to improve the struc-
ture and content of the questionnaire.

Regarding  the  sample,  59.3%of  the  respon-
dents  were  three-star  hotels;  36.1%  corre-
sponded  to  four-star  establishments  and  only 
4.67% were ﬁ ve-star hotels. The average number 
of employees in the hotels analysed was 48, the 
maximum  value  for  that  variable  being  235 
employees. The average size of the hotels was 
130 rooms and 250 beds, and ﬁ nally, regarding 
the type of hotel afﬁ liations, 41% of the estab-
lishments  were  chain-afﬁ liated,  whereas  the 
remaining 59% were independent.

In order to detect possible problems related 
to non-response error or bias, we drew a com-
parison  between  early  respondents  and  late 
respondents  within  each  population  for  each 
item  (Armstrong  and  Overton  1977),  after 
which we divided the data obtained into thirds, 
within  each  population,  according  to  the 
number of working days elapsed between the 
initial  mailing  to  the  ﬁ rm  and  the  receipt  of 
the questionnaire. The t-tests between the ﬁ rst 
and last third revealed no statistically signiﬁ -
cant  differences  in  the  mail  responses  for  the 
constructs  used.  Hence,  on  an  overall  basis, 
non-response  bias  does  not  appear  to  be  a 
problem in our study.

Measurements
The  relevant  writings  in  the  literature  were

constructs  depicted  in  Figure  1. All  measures 
were subjected to conﬁ rmatory factor analysis 
to provide support for the issues of dimension-
ality,  convergent  and  discriminant  validity. 
Table 1 shows scale items, standardized load-
ings, reliabilities and conﬁ rmatory factor anal-
ysis results of the variables of the research.

Environmental  legislation  (LEG).  This  variable 
included  four  items  drawn  from  Dean  and 
Brown  (1995),  King  (2000)  and  Porter  (1991). 
We  asked  managers  to  position  their  respec-
tive ﬁ rms on a scale of 1–7 depending on their 
grade of agreement or disagreement with the 
arguments of the issues related to environmen-
tal  regulation.  Exploratory  principal  compo-
nents analysis with varimax rotation of those 
items showed that they formed only one factor 
with eigenvalue >1. Cronbach’s alpha of envi-
ronmental regulation is 0.61.

Stakeholders  (STAKE).  It  was  deﬁ ned  as  any 
person,  group  or  organization  that  has  direct 
or indirect stake in an organization because it 
can affect or be affected by the organization’s 
actions,  objectives  and  policies.  This  variable 
included  six  items  drawn  from Álvarez  et  al. 
(2001).  We  used  seven  items  based  on  press 
and  collaboration  of  the  stakeholders  in  their 
relationships  with  the  ﬁ rm.  Each  item  was 
measured on a 7-point Likert response scale (1 
= ‘there are not any press or collaboration’, 7 = 
‘there are total press or collaboration’). Explor-
atory  principal  components  analysis  with 
varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed  that 
they formed two signiﬁ cant factors (eigenval-
ues >1): F1 STAKE = degree of pressure exerted 
by stakeholders (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.61) and 
F2  STAKE  =  level  of  collaboration  with  these 
groups (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).

Resources  and  capabilities  (R&C).  This  variable 
included 11 items drawn from Aragón-Correa 
(1998),  Christmann  (2000),  and  Hart  (1995). 
Managers  had  to  evaluate  if  those  resources 
had been used in the adoption of a proactive 
environmental  management.  Each  item  was 
measured  on  a  7-point  Likert  response  scale 
(1  =  ‘strongly  disagree’,  7  =  ‘strongly  agree’). 
Exploratory  principal  components  analysis 
with  varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed 
that  they  formed  three  signiﬁ cant  factors

M. D. López-Gamero et al.

(eigenvalues >1): F1 R&C = actions and degree 
of involvement of the top management in the 
ﬁ rm’s operations (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81), F2 
R&C = learning and knowledge of employees 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.77) and F3 R&C = speed 
and ﬂ exibility with which the ﬁ rm carries out 
changes to adapt to new environmental condi-
tions (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.76).

Managerial  perceptions  (MAN).  This  variable 
included seven items drawn from Del Brío et 
al. (2003), Hutchinson (1992) and Nijkamp et al. 
(1999).  We  asked  managers  to  position  their 
respective ﬁ rms on a scale of 1–7 depending on 
their  perception  about  the  natural  environ-
ment  as  a  competitive  opportunity  or  as  a 
threat (1 = ‘strongly opportunity’, 7 = ‘strongly 
threat’).  Exploratory  principal  components 
analysis with varimax rotation of those items 
showed that they formed only one factor with 
eigenvalue >1 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80).

Environmental  management  (EM).  We  consid-
ered two groups of items to measure the pro-
activeness  of  the  environmental  management 
drawn  from  different  studies  (Álvarez  et  al., 
2001; Carmona-Moreno et al., 2004): organiza-
tional aspects (15 items) and technical aspects 
(nine  items)  of  the  environmental  manage-
ment.  Managers  were  required  to  evaluate  in 
a  range  of  7  points  from  1  (they  had  not 
addressed  that  issue)  to  7  (they  were  leaders 
on  that  practice  in  their  sector)  if  they  had 
adopted those environmental practices. Explor-
atory  principal  components  analysis  with 
varimax  rotation  of  items  of  ‘environmental 
management-organizational  aspects’  showed 
that they formed two signiﬁ cant factors (eigen-
values >1): F1 EMORG = organizational aspects 
linked to knowledge and learning in the devel-
opment  of  environmental  practices  (Cron-
bach’s alpha = 0.93), and F2 EMORG = variables 
that reﬂ ected the link between the ﬁ rm and its 
stakeholders  during  the  development  of  the 
organization’s  environmental  management 
strategy (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). The ‘envi-
ronmental  management-technical  aspects’ 
variable  was  measured  using  nine  items. 
Exploratory  principal  components  analysis 
with  varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed 
that  they  formed  only  one  factor  with  eigen-
value >1 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89).

Environmental performance (ENP). ENP variable 
included nine items drawn from Stanwick and 
Stanwick  (1998)  and  Wagner  et  al.  (2002).  We 
asked managers to position his or her ﬁ rm on 
a scale of 1–7 depending on the position of the 
ﬁ rm in relation to competitors in environmen-
tal performance issues such as efﬁ cient use of 
resources,  reduction  of  emissions,  residues 
and  acoustic  pollution,  so  on.  Exploratory 
principal  components  analysis  with  varimax 
rotation  of  those  items  showed  that  they 
formed  only  one  factor  with  eigenvalue  >1 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93).

New  resources  and  capabilities  (NERAC).  We 
used seven items based on new resources and 
capabilities  drawn  from  Aragón-Correa  and 
Sharma  (2003),  Christmann  (2000)  and  Hart 
(1995).  Managers  had  to  evaluate  if  new 
resources  and  capabilities  had  developed  in 
the ﬁ rm as a consequence of the adoption of a 
proactive  environmental  management  (1  = 
‘strongly  disagree’,  7  =  ‘strongly  agree’).  A 
factor analysis was carried out of those items, 
resulting in one factor with eigenvalue >1 and 
Cronbach´s alpha = 0.92.

Competitive advantage (CA). We considered two 
groups of items to measure that variable: com-
petitive  advantage  on  costs  (CAC)  (four  items) 
and  competitive  advantage 
in  differentiation 
(CAD)  (ﬁ ve  items),  which  were  drawn  from 
Christmann  (2000),  Karagozoglu  and  Lindell 
(2000)  and  Wagner  and  Schaltegger  (2004). 
Through a 7-point Likert scale, managers rated 
respective organization’s competitiveness rela-
tive to that of other ﬁ rms in the sector. A factor 
analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  data  for  the 
items of competitive advantage on costs, result-
ing in one factor with eigenvalue >1 and Cron-
bach’s alpha = 0.78. In relation to the competitive 
advantage  in  differentiation,  again  one  factor 
was  found  in  the  factor  analysis,  with  eigen-
value >1 and Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86.

Financial performance (FP). We tested the model 
using  a  perceptual  measure  with  three  items 
(added value growth, economic and ﬁ nancial 
proﬁ tability) in which, through a 7-point Likert 
scale, managers rated their respective organi-
zation’s  performance  relative  to  that  of  other 
ﬁ rms  in  the  sector.  Exploratory  principal

components analysis with varimax rotation of 
those items showed that they formed only one 
factor with eigenvalue >1 (Cronbach’s alpha = 
0.72).

Control variable. Size (SIZE) was considered as 
a  control  variable.  The  logarithm  of  a  ﬁ rm’s 
number  of  employees  was  used  to  measure 
SIZE.

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

We  used  structural  equation  modelling 
(LISREL 8.5) to examine our hypotheses, with 
maximum  likelihood  with  robust  estimators 
(Satorra and Bentler 1994) as a method to esti-
mate  the  parameters,  because  multivariate 
normal  distribution  was  no  longer  valid  and 
the measurements for some variables were not 
continuous. Our input matrix was the asymp-
totic  variance–covariance  matrix.  We  take 
LEG, STAKE — degree of pressure exerted by 
stakeholders, STAKE — level of collaboration, 
R&C — involvement  of 
the  management, 
R&C — employees’  learning  and  knowledge 
and R&C — speed and ﬂ exibility to introduce 
changes to adapt to the environment as exog-
enous latent variables; and MAN, EM, NERAC, 
CAC,  CAD  and  FP  as  endogenous  latent 
variables.

relationships  between 

Table 2 presents the means, standard devia-
tions,  reliability  coefﬁ cients  and  correlations 
among the variables. Looking only at the high 
correlations  between  the  dimensions  we  may 
highlight 
the 
resources  and  capabilities  dimensions.  There 
are signiﬁ cant high and positive relationships 
between 
the 
management’  and  the  dimensions  ‘R&C — 
employees’  learning  and  knowledge’  and 
‘R&C — speed  and  ﬂ exibility  to  introduce 
changes  to  adapt  to  the  environment’.  The 
actions and degree of involvement of the top 
management  in  the  ﬁ rm’s  operations  are 
related  to  the  learning  and  knowledge  of 
employees  and  the  speed  and  ﬂ exibility  with 
which the ﬁ rm carries out changes to adapt to 
new  environmental  conditions.  These  results 
are  as  predicted  and  are  consistent  with 
prior  research  ﬁ ndings  (González-Benito  and 
González-Benito,  2005).  Environmental  man-
agement  dimensions  have  also  high  and

signiﬁ cant  correlations  between  them.  The 
relationship between the two types of organi-
zational aspects is strong, implying that if there 
is  link  between  the  ﬁ rm  and  its  stakeholders 
during the development of the organization’s 
environmental management strategy they are 
likely to regard knowledge and learning in the 
development  of  environmental  practices  as 
valuable.  Discriminant  validity  is  measured 
calculating  the  reliability  coefﬁ cients  of  the 
concepts and comparing them to the bivariate 
correlation between pairs of constructs. All reli-
ability coefﬁ cients exceeded the recommended 
0.6 level and were greater than the correlation 
between the two constructs of interest.

The  process  of  testing  the  measurement 
model is basically a conﬁ rmatory factor analy-
sis  (CFA)  task,  based  on  the  knowledge  of 
theory and empirical research, the hypotheses 
linking the observed measures and the under-
lying factors postulated a priori is being statisti-
cally  tested.  CFA  was  conducted  to  assess 
model ﬁ t (Jöreskog and Sorbom, 1993) for the 
measurement  model.  The  ﬁ t  statistics  for  the 
measurement model given in Table 3 indicate

that the measurement model ﬁ ts the data well. 
Furthermore,  the  measures  of  error  were 
uncorrelated, allowing progression to the next 
stage  of  the  Structural  equation  modeling 
(SEM) process.

Seeking to reduce the number of parameters 
to  estimate,  we  resorted  to  the  formation  of 
compound variables, so that a single indicator 
resulting from the sum of all parameters could 
determine  each  factor  (Landis  et  al.,  2000). 
Environmental  management  was  the  only 
variable  that  was  considered  through  three 
indicators  as  a  result  of  three  factors  (F1 
EMORG,  F2  EMORG  and  EMTEC).  Each  of 
these  indicators  was  also  resulting  from  the 
sum of all indicators that could determine each 
factor.

Final results of this model revealed that each 
ﬁ nal item signiﬁ cantly loads on its respective 
construct showing high convergent validity of 
the measurement scale for each construct. The 
hypothesized model provided an acceptable ﬁ t 
to the data. The Chi-square was signiﬁ cant (χ2 
=  116.74,  df  =  67,  p  =  0.000)  and  ﬁ t  indices 
clearly  exceeded  the  preferred  0.90  threshold

The results indicate that environmental leg-
islation and the pressure of stakeholders inﬂ u-
ence negatively in managerial perception, the 
sign  of  these  relationships  are  different  from 
the ones we had proposed, thus, Hypothesis 1 
and  Hypothesis  2a  are  not  supported.  The 
effect of the stakeholders’ collaboration is not 
signiﬁ cant, not supporting Hypothesis 2b.

In relation to Hypothesis 3, there is a positive 
effect of available resources and capabilities and 
the  managerial  perception.  Consequently,  this 
hypothesis 
is  supported.  Moreover,  when 

higher is the degree to which the manager sees 
the natural environment as a competitive oppor-
tunity, higher is the likelihood of developing a 
proactive  environmental  management,  thus, 
Hypothesis 4 is supported.

Regarding  Hypothesis  5,  when  the  avail-
ability of complementary resources and capa-
bilities  in  the  ﬁ rm  is  greater,  higher  is  the 
likelihood of developing a proactive environ-
mental  management.  Thus,  this  hypothesis  is 
also supported. We also ﬁ nd a statistically sig-
niﬁ cant  relationship  between  proactive  envi-
ronmental management and the improvement 
of the environmental performance, supporting 
Hypothesis 6.

In relation to Hypothesis 7 and Hypothesis 
8,  there  is  a  positive  effect  of  proactive  envi-
ronmental  management  and  environmental

which have been generated through the proac-
tive  environmental  management.  Conse-
quently Hypothesis 7a and Hypothesis 8a are 
not  supported,  and  Hypothesis  7b  and 
Hypothesis  8b  are  supported.  Results  also 
show  that  there  is  a  signiﬁ cant  and  positive 
effect  of  competitive  advantage  on  ﬁ nancial 
performance,  supporting  Hypothesis  9a  and 
Hypothesis 9b. Finally, in relation to the SIZE 
(control  variable),  it  has  only  a  signiﬁ cant 
inﬂ uence on the development of a more proac-
tive environmental management. A discussion 
of these results follows.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Research on the response of ﬁ rms to environ-
mental  concerns  has  mainly  focused  on  the 
manufacturing industry. The impact caused by 
the  hotel  industry  is  not  so  visible,  which  is 
why these organizations have attracted much 
less  research  attention.  Our  paper  is  a  step 
towards a better understanding of the environ-
mental  peculiarities  of  the  hotel  industry.  We 
would like to emphasize the following results. 
Good  business  and  sustainable  development 
go  hand  in  hand.  Managers’  commitment  to 
contribute  to  sustainable  development  holds 
the  key  to  long-term  business  success  and 
could become a source of competitive advan-
tage.  These  perceptions  are  behind  the  adop-
tion of an environmental management scheme 
with a stronger focus on proactive techniques. 
Environmental  legislation,  stakeholders,  as 
well as the amount and type of resources and 
capabilities available to the organization may 
inﬂ uence  the  managerial  perception  of  the 
natural  environment.  Once  the  ﬁ rm  assumes 
its  environmental  responsibility,  there  is  no 
reason  why  it  should  limit  its  organizational 
capacity  when  applying  proactive  environ-
mental  initiatives  to  improve  its  competitive-
ness. Thus, the resource-based view mediates 
the positive relationships of proactive environ-
mental  management  and  improved  environ-
mental 
competitive 
advantage  and  ﬁ nancial  performance.  Next, 
we are going to provide discussion and impli-
cations  of  each  relationship  showed  in  the 
whole model.

Environmental  legislation  has  a  negative 
signiﬁ cant  inﬂ uence  on  managerial  percep-
tions  about  the  natural  environment.  Unlike 
the research conducted with Spanish manufac-
turing  industries,  which  reveals  government 
and public regulations as the most important 
reason  to  invest  in  environmental  issues 
(Rivera-Camino, 2001), the hotel industry has 
relatively  little  legislative  pressure  (Ayuso, 
2006). Moreover, this legislation stems from a 
control logic (López-Gamero et al., 2009). The 
cost involved in complying with environmen-
tal requirements when the ﬁ rm’s main concern 
is  the  development  of  corrective,  end-of-pro-
cess  actions  provokes  an  increase  of  the  total 
cost incurred in the development of the whole 
infrastructure that is necessary for the ﬁ rm to 
adapt  to  the  new  regulatory  criteria.  Because 
command-and-control regulations conform to 
engineering rather than to business standards, 
they  induce  unnecessary  capital  investments 
and prevent good settling decisions (Tarui and 
Polasky,  2005).  For  this  reason,  legislators 
should  anticipate  how  the  regulation  might 
affect not only current emission levels, but also 
the investment in Research and Development 
(R&D) by regulated ﬁ rms. Moreover, the pro-
vision  of  education  and  information  on  envi-
ronmental protection must be the result of the 
joint, co-ordinated efforts of the public sector 
and  the  hotel  industry  (Shunnaq  et  al.,  2008), 
always seeking to increase the level of aware-
ness  on  the  most  relevant  issues  and  on  the 
possible methods to assess activities and imple-
ment programmes, showing the best practices 
and introducing training courses both for the 
management  and  for  the  staff  (Stabler  and 
Goodall, 1997).

Regarding stakeholders, their pressure has a 
signiﬁ cant negative effect on the perception of 
managers about the environment as a competi-
tive opportunity. Regarding the degree of col-
laboration  in  environmental  issues,  it  is  not 
signiﬁ cant. Customers and tour operators are 
the  most  inﬂ uential  pressure  groups  inside  a 
hotel  (Curtin  and  Busby,  1999;  Ayuso,  2006). 
Nevertheless,  tourists  do  not  discriminate 
between  hotels  according  to  environmental 
practices, but they discriminate depending on 
the  quality  of  the  service  offered,  to  such  an 
extent that some authors argue that the imple-
mentation  of  certain  environmental  practices

has as its aim to ‘disguise’ a cost-saving policy 
(Font  and  Tribe,  2001).  Tour  operators  only 
show an interest in environmental issues when 
they  work  with  customers  from  Central  and 
Northern  Europe  (Ayuso,  2006),  and  most  of 
the  tourists  in  Spain  are  British  and  Spanish. 
This low valuation can make managers reach 
the  conclusion  that  meeting  the  demands  of 
their  stakeholders  will  most  probably  reduce 
their  competitiveness  levels  with  respect  to 
other hotels which, in the absence of environ-
mental  practices,  can  offer  their  services  at  a 
more  competitive  price  to  a  customer  who  is 
currently not very aware of these issues. More-
over,  previous  interviews  and  observations 
made in our study show that the participation 
of  customers  in  environmental  issues  is  low, 
similar  to  Enz  and  Siguaw’s  (1999)  study.  It 
basically consists in completing questionnaires. 
Tourists  have  quite  often  hindered  the  adop-
tion of new environmental practices since they 
believed that those practices might reduce the 
service quality delivered by the hotel (Claver 
et al., 2007). Decision-making and development 
processes require stakeholders’ involvement at 
all  planning  levels.  For  this  reason,  tourists, 
residents and professionals should count on an 
interpretative service based on environmental 
education  (Holden  and  Sparrowhawk,  2002). 
Ayuso (2006) and Zhu et al. (2008) observes that 
stakeholders  generally  respond  with  higher 
motivation to environmental practices after an 
education period. This measure could raise the 
quality of the experience and help them develop 
greater awareness on the conservation and pro-
tection  of  resources  (Tsaur  et  al.  2006).  For 
example, Ayuso (2006) observes that employ-
ees generally respond with higher motivation 
to environmental practices after an education 
and training period.

In relation to the link existing between com-
plementary resources and capabilities and the 
managerial  attitude,  managers  see  the  hotel’s 
capability to adapt quickly and ﬂ exibly to the 
changes  operated  in  the  environment  as  an 
important  asset.  This  ﬁ nding  also  resulted 
from the study by Bansal (2005). Managers are 
willing to incorporate environmental measures 
because  they  think  that  environmental  con-
sciousness  will  increase,  resulting  in  varying 
tourist  demand  through  better  quality,  and 
competition  between  destinations  will  proba-

bly change the current context (Mihalic, 2000). 
The success of this change will depend on the 
capability to adapt to the new situation, that is, 
on the possibility to have an easy access to the 
information related to these practices, and on 
the  know-how  available  in  the  organization 
that  may  serve  to  develop  the  new  tasks  or 
processes (Zhu et al., 2008). In essence, manag-
ers  should  introduce  in-depth  changes  in  the 
routines  and  management  style,  and  success 
will consequently depend on the commitment 
to  implement  environmental  strategies  and 
develop learning processes.

It  also  seems  that  proactive  environmental 
management  leads  to  improved  environmen-
tal  performance.  Our  results  coincide  with 
those found in previous research studies (e.g. 
Zhu  and  Sarkis,  2004).  A  good  measure  to 
guarantee  an  improved  measurement  and 
management  of  environmental  performance 
within  the  hotel  should  be  the  diffusion  of 
information on good environmental practices, 
not  only  regarding  technical  product  and 
process  innovation  but  also  in  management 
practices.

Similar to Aragón-Correa and Sharma (2003), 
we have checked that the attitude and percep-
tions  of  managers  appear  as  essential  factors 
for the investment in proactive environmental 
technologies.  Managers 
therefore  have  a 
chance to inﬂ uence the degree of environmen-
tal  commitment  of  their  organization,  where 
external  and  internal  pressures  are  important 
and sometimes very strong (Aragón-Correa et 
al., 2004). Fraj-Andrés et al. (2008) indicate that 
managers’  involvement  with  environmental 
issues is intensive in ﬁ rms that perceive envi-
ronmental  regulations  as  a  threat.  This  con-
ﬁ rms the results of our study. Managers should 
take two aspects into account when they make 
estimates  about  the  evolution  of  proactive 
environmental management in the ﬁ rm. Firstly, 
being  the  ﬁ rst  to  adopt  environmental  prac-
tices  allows  managers  create  new  barriers  to 
imitation, such as the possibility of inﬂ uencing 
the  policy  process  (Cho  et  al.,  2006),  and  to 
simultaneously  attract  consumers  who  share 
environmental values to some extent and con-
sider them in their decision-making. Secondly, 
managers should consider aids and subsidies 
that they can receive from the authorities, the 
possible  low-interest  ﬁ nancing  offered  by

some  ﬁ nancial  institutions  for  the  develop-
ment  of  proactive  technologies,  and  also  the 
reduction  in  their  insurance  premiums  as  a 
result  of  the  diminished  environmental  risk. 
This  is  a  method  to  alter  the  ‘incentives’  for 
ﬁ rms to behave environmentally (Baumol and 
Blackman  1991).  Moreover,  this  incentive-
based  approach  to  the  business  environment 
can  be  immensely  useful  for  regulators  to 
guarantee observance of environmental behav-
iour by ﬁ rms (Kulshreshtha, 2007).

With  regard  to  the  mediating  role  of  the 
resource-based view in the relationship of pro-
active  environmental  management  and  envi-
ronmental  performance  with  competitive 
advantage,  we  have  checked,  similar  to 
Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008) and Sharma and 
Vredenburg (1998) found in their studies, that 
investment  in  pollution  proactive  practices 
and  environmental  performance 
improve-
ments contribute to the development of valu-
able  capabilities 
the 
achievement  of  a  differentiation  competitive 
advantage. These results show that managers 
do  not  report  any  major  changes  in  the  cost 
position relative to key competitors, but ﬁ rms 
investing 
improvements 
have to some extent gained a stronger reputa-
tion  among  customers.  Although  there  have 
been  advances  in  products  and  processes, 
the  more  signiﬁ cant  effects  seem  to  have 
appeared  in  marketing  and  image  build-
ing — a ﬁ nding obtained by Lindell and Kara-
gozoglu  (2001)  as  well.  Thus,  managers  have 
excellent opportunities to establish a close link 
with customers and other stakeholders with a 
view to develop loyalty and legitimacy based 
on ecological preservation (Dinan, 2000), which 
in turn will most probably lead to a differentia-
tion  competitive  advantage  (Sharma  et  al., 
2007).

in  environmental 

Best practices aimed at larger investments or 
higher  added  values,  as  well  as  the  adoption 
of formal certiﬁ cation systems, have a tangible 
cost  for  the  hotels. At  the  moment,  ﬁ rms  see 
these costs as investments not leading to com-
petitive advantages. Thus, the implementation 
of more costly practices will largely depend on 
the  availability  of  sufﬁ cient  ﬁ nancial  and 
human resources and public funding to imple-
ment environmental management systems and 
certify  for  the  eco-label  (Ayuso,  2006).  In  this 

sense, managers in the hotel industry ought to 
augment  organizational  capabilities  such  as 
continuous  innovation,  employee  motivation, 
and stakeholder involvement, as this will help 
them reach cost competitive advantages.

Competitive advantage has a positive effect 
on ﬁ nancial performance. These results are rel-
evant because they show that the ultimate con-
sequence of any competitive advantage derived 
from proactive environmental management is 
an improved ﬁ nancial performance (González-
Benito  and  González-Benito,  2005).  This  rela-
tionship  also  appeared  in  studies  by  Claver 
et  al.  (2007)  and  Lindell  and  Karagozoglu 
(2001). Thus, managers should invest in envi-
ronmental management because the adoption 
of environmental measures might help differ-
entiate  them  from  their  less  environmentally 
friendly  competitors  and  thus  lead  to  higher 
returns.  For  instance,  hotels  can  achieve  a 
market  advantage  by  deﬁ ning  the  environ-
mental  proﬁ le  of  their  services,  thereby  con-
tributing to the general attributes of the tourism 
product.

Finally, some limitations and future research 
lines  should  be  noted.  Firstly,  since  this 
research  paper  relies  heavily  on  self-reported 
measurements  provided  by  ﬁ rm  managers, 
future research works could add to the conﬁ -
dence place in the results reported here by rep-
licating  this  study  with  more  direct  objective 
measurements  of  the  theoretical  constructs. 
Even so, in relation to environmental manage-
ment,  this  alternate  approach  may  also  be 
inadequate  since  it  may  not  fairly  reﬂ ect  a 
ﬁ rm’s overall environmental management due 
to its multidimensional nature. As Grifﬁ n and 
Mahon (1997) explicitly discuss in their studies, 
environmental management is a ‘social perfor-
mance’  variable.  Secondly,  it  would  be  inter-
esting  to  establish  causal  interrelationships 
between  the  factors  considered  in  the  study: 
for  instance,  environmental  legislation  may 
inﬂ uence the pressure exerted by stakeholders 
on  the  ﬁ rm;  or  the  availability  of  certain 
resources and capabilities is likely to facilitate 
legislative  compliance,  among  other  things. 
Possibly, the results obtained will only be valid 
for the hotel industry examined in the Spanish 
context.  That  is  why  a  future  line  of  research 
could  also  be  to  extend  the  analysis  to  other 
countries.
