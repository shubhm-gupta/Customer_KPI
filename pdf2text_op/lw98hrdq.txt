Human Resource Orientation and 
Corporate Performance 

Long W Lam, Louis I?  White 

H R D  has been seen as an issue that is criticalfor U S .  corporations so that 
they can remain competitive. Yet  little has been known about the strategc role 
of  H R D  and how it may influence corporate performance.  In this study, we 
have argued that HRD plays an immensely strategic role when combined with 
effective recruitment and compensation policies. These three activities together 
contribute to the company’s human resource (HR) orientation and create sw- 
tainable competitive advantages for organizations. Datafrom fourteen  man- 
ufacturing industries supported the proposition that companies with a strong 
HR orientation performed signijicantly better than firms with a weaker H R  
orientation. Suggestions were offered with respect to the strategic and devel- 
opmental role of  H R  management. 

The  United  States has  led  the  world  in  the  annual  rate  of  productivity 
improvements since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. From the start 
of  the 1950s, however, that productivity improvement factor has decreased sig- 
nificantly  The reverse has been  true in countries such as Japan and other 
Pacific Rim nations where the productivity growth rate has increased rapidly. 
In 1972, productivity for the average Japanese worker was 63 percent of  that 
of an American worker. This changed quickly so that by 1988, the average pro- 
ductivity of  a Japanese worker  had  increased to 80 percent  of  the average 
American worker’s productivity (Cascio, 1995). From 1970 to 1990, the pro- 
ductivity growth rate for the American worker slowed to an average of  1.3 per- 
cent annually 

Since then, this alarming trend has begun to spawn a greater emphasis on 
HRD. If  mishandled, employees can be a source of  major corporate difficul- 
ties; if, on the other hand, they are dealt with competently, employees can be 
developed to an organization’s competitive advantage (Becker and Gerhart, 
1996). As a result, HRD is viewed as a significant issue for U.S. companies, so 
that they can remain strategically competitive in the global market (Sonnen- 
feld, 1985). Today, the challenge is to use HR in the planning and problem- 
solving process in such a way that companies can identify the critical employee

skills in the corporate and business strategies (Hall, 1984; Butler, Ferris, and 
Napier, 1991; Becker and Gerhart, 1996). HR executives are also expected to 
act as change catalysts in making organizations more productive. This trend 
reflects a growing awareness of  the contributions that HRD can make to the 
firms success. 

This growing awareness has spawned a number of  empirical studies that 
investigate how HR  practices could contribute to a firm’s performance (for a 
review, see Butler, Ferris, and Napier,  1991, and Becker and Gerhart,  1996). 
Following this line of  research, many studies have centered on a single HR 
practice, such as recruitment or compensation, and then evaluated the per- 
formance effect on companies (Schmidt, Hunter, McKenzie, and Muldrow, 
1979; Balkin and Gomez-Mejia, 1990; Gerhart and Milkovich, 1990). The 
effectiveness  of  managerial  training  has  also  been  researched  extensively. 
Although it was concluded that managerial training was overall moderately 
effective in terms of  improvlng participants’ learning and job behavior (Burke 
and Day, 1986; Bartel, 19941, relatively few studies have addressed whether 
training programs can improve a company’s profitability (Magnum, Magnum, 
and Hansen, 1990). As a result, trainers often have to justify the financial con- 
tribution of their programs and explain how they may add value to the com- 
pany (Gordon, 1987). 

Although training and development alone may have little effect on cor- 
porate  performance, they can be seen to play a much more  important role 
when  coupled  with  effective  recruitment  and  compensation  practices 
(Wright and Snell, 199 1).There has been speculation that researchers should 
distinguish between the complete systemic view of  HR policies and the mere 
adoption of  traditional  HR practices, because the systemic view may pro- 
vide more details about the interaction of  different HR practices (Huselid, 
Jackson, and Schuler, 1997; MacDuffie, 1995). In this study, we viewed the 
complete implementation of  HR systems as a company orientation and eval- 
uated whether such an orientation can lead to superior corporate perfor- 
mance, 

We  explained  from  a strategic  perspective  the  importance  of  effective 
recruitment and compensation in attracting and retaining competent employ- 
ees, as well as the significance of  training and development in terms of sus- 
taining the human advantage. The creation  of  a strong HR orientation, we 
argued, should include equally important roles for recruitment, compensation, 
and training and development. 

We measured  these HR  activities by surveying companies to determine 
their perceptions of whether or not their competitors have strong HR  orienta- 
tions. We found that companies that developed the reputation of being HR on- 
ented also enjoyed significant financial payoffs in terms of  profitability, sales 
growth, and appreciation of  stock values. At the end of  this chapter, we will 
discuss the implications of  our findings for the research and practice of strate- 
gic HR  development. 


Human Resource Orientation and CorDorate Performance

Theoretical Background 

Concept of  HR  Orientation.  In this study, we defined HR orientation as “a 
systematic organizational effort to attract, retain, and develop competent and 
committed human resources.” Organizations that develop a strong HR orien- 
tation will not only adopt a single HR practice but also emphasize three behav- 
ioral components-attraction, 
retention, and development. In this way, they 
will be transforming employees as the basis of sustainable competitive advan- 
tages (see Figure  1). The process of creating sustainable competitive advan- 
tages has been cited recently by theorists of strategic management to describe 
how firms can trace their successes to their internal stock of resources (Barney, 
1991; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). From this perspective, human resources 
are viewed on a par with technological or physical resources in terms of hav- 
ing the same strategic potential. This strategic perspective has led Wright and 
his colleagues to urge organizations to focus on the serial steps of recruitment, 
compensation, and training in order to attract and develop competent employ- 
ees (Wright and Snell, 1991; Wright and McMahan, 1992). 

Following this approach, we identify recruitment as the first critical strat- 
egy that HR-oriented firms will employ, because effective recruitment efforts 
help the company “locate the relevant competencies and attract them to the 
organization” (Wright and Snell, 1991, p. 221). Competent employees are not 
necessarily loyal, however. To retain competent employees, it could be critical

to have a competitive level of  compensation and fringe benefits (Balkin and 
Gomez-Mejia, 1990; Gerhart and Milkmich, 1990).Therefore, the second step 
involves implementing compensation strategies to improve employees’ level of 
commitment. Finally, to sustain a competitive advantage, a company needs fur- 
ther developmental investments to maintain the level of  superior HR compe- 
tence (Magnum, Magnum, and Hansen, 1990). Rivals are constantly striving 
to improve their competitive positions. Thus, a competitive advantage is not 
sustainable unless a company makes continuous improvements to keep com- 
petitors from matching its competence level. The third step in this HR orien- 
tation also has to do with training a committed workforce. In interaction with 
recruitment and compensation, increasing the workforce’s competence is pos- 
tulated to increase workers’ sense of efficacy, because workers feel that they can 
perform well enough to make significant contributions to the organization 
(Hackman and Oldham, 1980). Thus, the level of  employee commitment may 
also be enhanced through training and development. 

On the other hand, the pursuit of an HR orientation can also exceed con- 
ventional definitions of HR practices. There are cultural, strategc, structural, and 
cognitive ramifications for organizations if they decide to adopt HR as their cor- 
porate orientation. First, organizational culture represents a company’s values and 
belief system (Schuler and Huber, 1993). The aspect of  organizational culture that 
relates to employees is a company’s HR beliefs and values about the role of HR in 
the success of corporations (Schuler, 1992). If companies believe strongly in the 
importance of  HR, t h  convmion will be reflected in their HR activities. For exam- 
ple, “companies such as Levi Strauss that have a culture of  caring for and respect- 
ing the individual are likely to offer employment security and provide benefits for 
a variety of employee needs. In this way, many employees learn the culture of the 
it selects, what criteria it evaluates, 
organization through the HR activitie-how 
and what it compensates most highly’‘ (Schuler and Huber, 1993, p. 70). 

Second, the pursuit of  an HR onentation represents a firm’s strategic choice 
by recognizing that human resources, similar to other physical and techno- 
logical resources, can become important ingredients of  a firm’s competitive 
strategy (Barney. 1991; Wright and Snell, 1991; Wright and McMahan, 1992). 
Companies adopting this approach should devote their attention to various 
strategic HR practices, such as staffing, creating reward systems, and imple- 
menting HRD, and should incorporate them into the company’s strategic plan 
(Butler, Ferris, and Napier, 1991; Abelson, Ferris, and Urban, 1988). 

Third, the extent of  HR orientation can also affect the way in which orga- 
nizations organize their HR functions. Companies with a minimal HR orien- 
tation often view the HR  department as a staff function. The department may 
be  embedded  in  a larger  administrative  division, and the head  of  the  HR 
department will therefore not assume a key role in the organizational hierar- 
chy. A contrasting approach would elevate the HR  department to be on par 
with other functional units. Although such a structural change alone will not 
guarantee  a greater emphasis on HR, it should be viewed as a positive  step

toward a more holistic approach-one that recognizes HR as central to orga- 
nizational design and effectiveness. 

Finally, a strong HR orientation can alter the way organizations perceive 
external events and the way they prioritize internal activities. Organizations are 
said to adopt one of the four mental “frames” or perspectives as their cognitive 
orientation.  These are structural, human resource, political,  and symbolic 
frames (Bolman and Deal, 1997). This study focused on the creation of an HR 
frame. Bolman and Deal argued that the adoption of an HR frame will enable 
organizations to have “a sensitive understanding of people and their symbolic 
relationship with organizations” (p. 102). We hold that a strong HR orientation 
will help organizations recognize the human needs of their employees. 

Impact ofHR  Orientation on Corporate Performance.  Does HR orientation 
have any impact on corporate performance besides its cultural, strategic, struc- 
tural, and cognitive manifestations? Yes, we believe there are two reasons behind 
a positive impact of HR orientation on corporate performance. First, HR-oriented 
firms are likely to enjoy substantial cost savings by reducing employee absen- 
teeism and turnover rates. From a cost perspective, an absent employee often 
means a loss in wages and benefits. The annual cost of unscheduled absence has 
been estimated to range from about $250 to $500 per employee (Cascio, 1995). 
It is beneficial, therefore, for firms to reduce the rate of absenteeism. For each case 
of employee turnover, the company incurs additional expenses to terminate and 
replace that person. The termination costs may include the expenses of an exit 
interview and the increase of unemployment tax. After termination, new employ- 
ees are needed to fill the vacant position. Thus, there will be an increase in 
replacement costs in terms of additional recruiting and training (Cascio, 1995). 
These replacement costs can be minimized if companies incorporate HRD activ- 
ities into their strategic business plans so that they can rely more on existing 
employees to fill vacant positions (Friedman and LeVino, 1984). 

Second, HR-oriented firms are also likely to develop their employees into 
a more competent workforce, because they place stronger emphasis on recruit- 
ing, compensating, and training and development. The development of employ- 
ees into a highly competent workforce has been argued to produce competitive 
advantages that are more valuable and also more difficult to imitate (Pfeffer, 
1994). For these reasons, a strong HR orientation may bring significant eco- 
nomic benefits to companies (Gatewood and Field, 1994; Cascio, 1995). The 
advantages of increasing employee commitment and creating a more compe- 
tent workforce led us to propose the following research question: Does a strong 
HR orientation have a positive impact on corporate performance? 

Research Methodology 

Industry Setting and Sample.  The sample consisted of  firms from four- 
teen manufacturing industries in the United States.’ These fourteen industries 
were  purposely  selected  to  create a  diverse  contextual  background.  They 


356 

Lam, White 

include a variety of  products and manufacturing  technologies, ranging from 
heavy equipment, such as farm machines and aircraft engines, to light equip- 
ment, such as electrical  houseware  and electronic  components. They  also 
include various industry structures, ranging from growing to declining indus- 
tries, from oligopolistic to fragmented industries, and from high-technology to 
low-technology industries. 

The firms were selected from the COMPUSTAT database, which contains 
financial and stock market information  for major  U.S. corporations. To  be 
included  in  the sample, a firm had  to meet  several criteria. First, because 
smaller firms are more prone to fold and are therefore less likely to be traced 
in follow-up studies, we included only larger firms (those whose annual sales 
were  $2.5 million  or more).  Second, to  avoid  confounding  corporate and 
diversification effects on firm performance, we included only firms classified 
as having a dominant business in a sampled industry (specifically, firms with 
70 percent of  more of  their total sales in one of  the fourteen industries; see 
Rumelt, 1974). Using these criteria, we selected 235 firms from the COMPU- 
STAT database. 

Measurement and Sources of  Data.  Multiple sources were used to collect 

data on HR orientation and corporate performance. 
HR  Orientation.  We  used survey techniques to collect data about each 
firm’s HR orientation. Using the corporate and personnel data provided by the 
COMPUSTAT database, Dun and Bradstreetk Million  Dollar Directory (1993), 
and Standard and Poor’s Reguter of  Corporations, Directors, and Executives (1993), 
we contacted four senior executives at each company in the fall of  1993. The sur- 
vey was administered using the total design method (Dillman, 1978), which con- 
sisted of pretests, pilot tests, prenotification postcards, first-round mail, follow-up 
postcards, second-round mail, and second follow-up postcards. This procedure 
yielded 246 usable questionnaires, which is equivalent to a response rate of 26.3 
percent [246 responsed(235 firms x 4 executives)]. No statistical differences were 
found between the responding and the nonresponding sample.’ 

Competitive assessment was used to determine the level of  HR orientation, 
If a studys purpose is to document how certain HR practices are developed, 
the firm itself is probably an ideal informant. Because we were more interested 
in how corporate performance was affected, however, we believed that outside 
constituents would be in a better, and perhaps more objective, position to 
assess the external reputation of  a firm’s HR  orientation, As a result, we chose 
competitors as the key informants in this study. A similar approach of  com- 
petitive assessment was used by Cappelli and Crocker-Hefter (1996) when they 
measured distinctive HR  competencies. 

In a cover letter accompanying the questionnaire, we asked each execu- 
tive to respond  to a series of  HR questions about two competing firms. We 
determined  competitors by  locating firms in  the sampling frame  that  sold 
products that were the most similar (the product information was provided by 
COMPUSTAT). The survey was also initially designed so that executives of

each company would evaluate HR orientation for two competitors and so that 
the company’s own HR orientation would also be evaluated by other execu- 
tives  from  two  different  competing  firm^.^  In  the  final sample,  120 firms 
received competitor responses. 

As defined previously, an HR orientation is conceptualized as a systematic 
organizational effort to attract, retain, and develop competent and committed 
employees. Accordingly, we wanted respondents to evaluate a firm’s HR ori- 
entation on these items (on a seven-point scale). We asked: 

To what extent is the company characterized by 
(a)  effective recruitment of valued employees? 
(b)  above-average compensation and fringe benefits? 
(c)  extensive training and development programs? 

The results of Cronbachs alpha and intraclass correlation indicated that 
the scale had achieved acceptable levels of  interitem and interrater reliability 
Uudd, Smith, and Kidder, 1991; James, 1982; Glick, 19851.‘ Because of the 
high level of convergence, we first averaged these items to generate individual 
executive ratings. We then used the mean rating among executives to measure 
HR orientation for each company 

Corporate Performance.  In conducting studies of corporate performance, 
researchers of strategic management have recommended using multiple mea- 
sures of  corporate performance (Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1986). As a 
result, three different measures of corporate performance were used in this 
study The first measure was return on assets. A firm’s return on assets is an indi- 
cator of  accounting profitability. It was computed by dividing the operating 
income by total assets in 1993. The second measure was growth in sales. Sales 
growth can capture how well customers accept a company’s products or ser- 
vices. We calculated the average annual growth of  sales between  1990 and 
1993. The third measure was growth in stock values. To capture how well firms 
maximize the shareholder’s value, we also measured the annual growth rate of 
a firm’s stock market value. We did this by (1) computing market value (the 
share price multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares) and (2) 
calculating the average annual growth of  market values between  1990 and 
1993. Because the data were skewed, a natural logarithm of  growth in market 
values was used  as a dependent variable. Data for operating income, total 
assets, sales, and stock market values were extracted from the COMPUSTAT 
database. 

Exogenous Factors.  Because the level of  corporate performance tends to 
vary across industries, we included three types of  industry characteristics in 
this study (see Dess, Ireland, and Hitt, 1990): research intensity, industry con- 
centration, and industry growth. The level of  corporate performance may be 
affected by the intensity of research efforts that characterizes each industry We 
measured this industry characteristic by averaging the ratio of R&D expenses

and sales of the sampled firms in each of  the fourteen industries. These indus- 
try-level  data  were  obtained  from  COMPUSTAT.  Industry  concentration 
describes the structure of  the industry in terms of the level of control exercised 
by large organizations. It was measured by the total market shares captured by 
the largest four firms in an industry The data were provided by the U.S. Bureau 
of  the Census.5 The rate at which an industry is growing shows the level of cus- 
tomer demand for the products and services. This variable was measured using 
the compound annual growth rate of  industry sales over a seven-year period 
(1987 to 1994). The data were provided by The U S .  Industrial Outlook (1994). 
In addition to accounting for industry effects, this study also controlled 
for a number of  firm effects before examining how HR orientation  relates to 
corporate performance  (see Capon, Farley, and Hoenig, 1990, for a review of 
firm effects). Those firm effects included age, debt position, and market share. 
A firm’s age may affect how the company performs. To control for this effect, 
we used the number of years since a firm first issued stock as a proxy for a 
company’s age. These data were provided  by COMPUSTAT. The amount of 
debt a firm has may also affect its performance. The ratios of debt to total assets 
in  1993 were extracted from COMPUSTAT. Like age, firm size may affect a 
company’s financial performance. We measured size in terms of  a firm’s mar- 
ket share relative to its largest three competitors. Measuring market share in 
relative terms allows the variable to reflect the firm’s size advantage and mar- 
ket position within its industry. Firm sales in  1993 were extracted  from the 
COMPUSTAT database. 

Empirical Findings 
Table 1 lists univariate statistics and correlations for all the variables used in the 
data analyses. Our research question predicted that an HR orientation would 
relate to firm performance. Because the effect of  HR  orientation was expected 
to be positive, a one-tailed test of  significance was used. As Table 2 indicates, 
the beta coefficients of several exogenous factors are statistically significant when 
return on assets is analyzed. This includes research intensity (p < .Ol), indus- 
try growth rate (p < .05), and debt divided by total assets (p < .OOl). The find- 
ings also suggest that after we account for these industry and firm effects, HR 
orientation is still strongly related to return on assets (p < .05). Similar results 
were also obtained when the other two measures of  firm performance were ana- 
lyzed. In both cases, HR-oriented firms were able to outperform their competi- 
tors in terms of growth in sales (p < .Ol) and growth in stock values (p < ,051. 
Therefore, the overall results strongly support our research question; sig- 
nificant financial payoffs were found among companies that strongly empha- 
sized recruitment, compensation, and training and development. Through a 
strong HR orientation, companies enjoy a more competent and committed 
workforce, thus creating a sustainable competitive advantage that rivals will 
find difficult to surpass. The result also illustrates the strategic importance of

Discussion and Conclusion 
The purpose of  this chapter was to investigate the effects of  an HR orientation 
on corporate performance. HR orientation was defined as a systematic organi- 
zational effort to attract, retain, and develop competent and committed employ- 
ees. We proposed that HR-oriented organizations would perform better because 
they place stronger emphasis on attraction, retention, and development in order 
to create a low-cost sustainable competitive advantage. Data on HR orientation 
were  obtained  from U.S. companies  in  fourteen manufacturing industries. 
Results supported the hypothesis that companies with a strong HR orientation 
performed significantly better than firms with a weaker HR orientation. Such 
findings suggest that corporations have strong financial incentives in promot- 
ing HR cultures and should invest heavily in their HR practices. 

The findings should be interpreted carefully, however, with respect to the 
limitations of  this study. First, as indicated earlier, the sample for this study 


Human Resource Orientation and Corporate Performance 

361 

came from the 1993 COMPUSTAT database. This approach made the study 
static; that is, we took a snapshot, or one-time view, of  certain aspects of a firm. 
Future research could try to avoid this static approach. That is, a future inves- 
tigation of  the hypothesis tested herein would attempt to find a causal rela- 
tionship between HR orientation and firm performance over time. Data on firm 
performance could be analyzed from the initiation of the corporate activity on 
recruitment, compensation, and training and development. In this way, the 
degree of an HR orientation’s impact could be determined more precisely This 
method might then provide future studies with a more direct measurement of 
the relationship between HR orientation and firm performance. 

Second, there  are also certain  limitations  regarding the use  of  survey 
methodology. For instance, various respondents may have different percep- 
tions of an HR orientation. Future research should therefore consider alterna- 
tive methods (for example, focus groups and case studies), so that results can 
be compared with the measurement of  HR orientation. 

Third, our findings may lack generalizability. To minimize potential noise 
about corporate performance, we limited our sample to domestic, manufac- 
turing companies. One should therefore exercise caution when generalizing 
the results beyond the population from which the sample was drawn. To alle- 
viate this issue, future studies might adopt a different sample, such as a more 
international group of  organizations. Researchers would then be able to assess 
the impact of cultural differences and of  differing nations on the HR orienta- 
tion and corporate performance. If incorporated, these suggestions might shed 
light on the consistently increasing importance of HR orientation and its role 
in successful corporate performance in the global arena. 

Despite the need for further research, our findings may have strong impli- 
cations regarding the demand for strategic HR development and the expanded 
strategic role of  HR executives. First, the conventional view regarding HRD is 
that it is needed when companies experience (1) a lack of  qualified employ- 
ees,  (2) changes  of  job performance  standards,  or  (3) a high  variance  of 
employee outputs for the same job (Hall and Goodale, 1986). Our findings 
imply an additional strategic need for HRD; besides ensuring effective recruit- 
ment and compensation systems, HRD helps to sustain the human advantage 
vis-a-vis competitors. 
Second, our results imply that the workforce can add a valuable compet- 
itive advantage for organizations. Consequently, we believe that HRD should 
be one of  the building blocks in corporate strategic plans. HR directors should 
be included at the strategic level of  decision making similar to directors of 
other functional areas. This strategic restructuring would then allow the HR 
director to help select strategic alternatives so that HR strategies could be for- 
mulated to support organizational strategic choices (Hall, 1984). The employ- 
ees needed to support the organizational strategy could then be recruited. 
Available staffing requirements would be known and fulfilled, wage and salary 
policies could be worked through, and necessary training requirements would

be developed so that critical HRD activities could be initiated. Firms adopting 
such an HR orientation would then be positioned  to capitalize on the advan- 
tages of  a well-trained and committed workforce. 

Notes 
1. COMPUSTAT contained  more than fourteen manufactunng  industnes. These are the four- 
teen industnes selected for the study: farm machines, office machines, refrigerator and heating 
equipment. electrical houseware, audio and video equipment, personal wireless communication 
equipment. electronic components, auto parts, aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft parts, electrical 
testing and measuring instruments, analytical instruments,  and measuring and control devices. 
We chose only manufacturing industnes in order to minimize the influences of macroeconomic 
factors (for example, capital investment and economic cycles) on corporate performance. 
2.  No significant differences (p <  05) were noticed between the responding and the nonre- 
sponding samples in t e r n  of  firm size (log of  annual sales [t = 0.881, log of total assets [ t  = 0.691) 
or in terms of  firm performance (return on assets  It = 0.161, stock market values  [ t  = 1.911). 
3.  In the final sample, some firms received one response from one of their competitors whereas 
others received multiple responses. When analyzing the data, we  recognized that the number of 
respondents was not equal among the companies and that this discrepancy could introduce poten- 
tial biases to the findings  The results of intraclass correlations (ICC(1) and ICC(2)), however, sug- 
gested that both single-rater  and mean-rater  responses  were reliable.  In terms of  single-rater 
response, the ICC(1) was 0 36, surpassing the acceptable level of  single-rater reliability proposed 
by James (1982). In other words, the information on HR orientation was reliable, even though one 
response was used per firm. Based on this information, firms having one response were included 
in the data analysis. In terms of multiple responses per firm, the level of  ICC(2) was 0.65, which 
also reached the acceptable  standard of  mean-rater  reliability proposed  by Glick (1985). As a 
result, when a firm received multiple responses, we used the average to measure HR orientation. 
4. Cronbach's alpha was .82 for the interitem reliability. Also see note 3. 
5.  Andy Hait, Special Report Branch of  the Bureau of  Census, kindly provided  the data.
