Abstract 

There  is  a  growing  awareness  of  large  differences  in  worker  turnover  and  pay  between  firms. 
However, there is little knowledge about the effects of this on firm performance. This paper describes how 
personnel policies with respect to pay, tenure and worker flows are related to economic performance of the 
firm.  Here  we  follow  the  population  of  7118  medium-to-large  sized  private  sector  Danish  firms  over  the 
period  1992-95.  In  an  instrumental variables framework,  we use changes in the personnel composition of 
different  firms  operating  in  the  same  local  labour  market  to  provide  exogenous  identifying  personnel 
structure  variation.  It  is  found  that  personnel  policy  is  strongly  related  to  economic  performance.  At  the 
margin,  more  hires  are  associated  with  lower  profit,  and  more  separations  with  higher  profit.  For  the 
average firm, one new job, all else equal, is associated with euro 2680 lower annual profit. Higher wage level 
and lower wage growth is associated with greater profit. A workforce that has less tenure, all else equal, is 
more profitable.

1. Motivation and Introduction 

 It is now an established fact that there are high levels of job turnover and worker flows between 
firms in many OECD countries. Thus, Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) report worker turnover rates 
of about 19 % for the manufacturing industry in the USA. Albæk and Sørensen (1998) show a 
similarly high turnover for Denmark. Werwatz et al. (1999) have shown that manufacturing is not 
the only industry with high turnover rates, and that some industries have average turnover rates 
that  are  almost  30%  higher  than  manufacturing,  while  others  are  lower.  Furthermore,  it  is  a 
common finding that job creation in firms is achieved through a simultaneous hiring and firing 
process. And similarly, job destruction happens also through simultaneous hiring and firing. High 
levels  of  worker  turnover  are  a  persistent  feature  of  many  firms.  This  is  important  for  firms, 
because of the associated costs and benefits. Direct costs related to each newly hired are reported 
in surveys to be about 25-30% of annual base salary1.  On top of that comes presumably indirect 
costs of turnover related to the disturbance of the organizational structure and benefits to the firm 
of employing someone with new human capital (Lazear, 1997). The view has for many years been 
that wages and quit rates are jointly determined by the firm. According to this view, the firm takes 
as given the relationship between wages and quit rates revealed by the worker and chooses that 
wage/quit set which maximizes profit (Parsons, 1977). To our knowledge, there are no empirical 
studies that attempt to estimate the total effects of turnover on profit. One of the reasons is that 
such  a  task  would  be  highly  data  demanding.  Thus,  it  is  not  sufficient  to  use  data  for  firm 
performance and turnover, because firms use wages and wage policies as a management tool to 
restrain or increase turnover. And wages have their own impact on firm performance.  With a new 
dataset covering all Danish firms and work places, we can show the impact of different turnover 
and wage policies on the performance of a large number of firms and thus overcoming some of the 
problems of controlling for heterogeneity.  

Turnover  is  dealt  with  in  different  strands  of  the  management  and  economics  literature.  The 
literature on resource based firms includes all assets, capabilities, organizational processes, firm 
attributes, information, knowledge, etc controlled by the firm. These resources can all be used to 
conceive  of  and  implement  their  strategies,  (Barney,  1991).    Barney  focuses  on  3  different 
resources of the firm, Physical Capital, Human Capital (Becker 1964) and Organizational Capital

(Tomer, 1987). Turnover plays a prominent role in the latter 2, because high turnover means that 
the human and organizational capital may be quickly eroded or transformed by newcomers.  Even 
with respect to physical capital turnover of employees play a role, because utilization of physical 
capital  depends on the experience of the work force. The consequence of this is of course that 
firms will use substantial resources on controlling and regulating turnover.  

The Human Capital view on turnover is closely related to the idea of firm-specific human capital. 
The more firm-specific capital a worker has, the bigger the loss for the firm if the worker quits. 
The costs emerge at the time of hiring a new employee, since the costs at the time of quitting are 
sunk.  As  a  consequence,  the  firm  is  expected  to  let  the  wage  profile  increase  for  each  worker 
reflecting the potential loss to the firm if the worker leaves. To some extent, that will reflect the 
accumulation  of  firm-specific  human  capital.  The  firm  does  not  have  to  match  the  capital 
accumulation  completely,  because  the  worker  cannot  obtain  the  same  high  level  of  wage  in 
another firm. By moving, the worker loses her relatively high wage in the current firm and will 
have to accept a much lower starting wage in another firm. Therefore, the worker will be reluctant 
to change job.  

One way of retaining the worker is to pay a wage that increases with number of years in the firm. 
The wage scale could even be created so that the wage starts at a level lower than the alternative 
wage but increases to a level where the person in the end of her career is paid above her marginal 
productivity.  This  is  often  called  the  back-loaded  wage  profile.  However,  using  an  increasing 
wage profile to retain workers is moderated by union pressure for compressed wages. One will 
expect  that  firms,  who  are  expected  to have larger screening and advertising costs will also be 
willing to pay the largest wage premia to prevent turnover. Cyclical effects will also have an effect 
on turnover, (Ehrenberg and Smith, 1999). Thus, workers will have a higher probability of quitting 
when it is relatively easy for them to obtain a better job quickly. This will happen when the labour 
market is tight. When the market is loose, one will expect that the quit rate is small.  

An alternative perspective is the value to a firm of having a flow of new workers entering because 
they bring new ideas, new knowledge and new resources with them. The knowledge is in the form 
of  general  human  capital  obtained  at  school  and  in  other  firms.  In  order  to  get  room  for  new 
workers, older workers may have to be sacrificed if the net hire of new employees cannot happen 
as  part  of  an  expansion.  However,  laying  off  too  many  old  workers  mean  that  the  strategy  of 

 

3


retaining  other  workers  will  be  less  credible  and  the  firm  will  therefore  have  to  pay  higher 
premiums to those it wants to retain.  

The  firm  will  also  be  more  reluctant  to  lay-off  workers  if  they  possess  larger  amount  of  firm-
specific  capital  or  if  their  wage  because  of  wage  compression  is  lower  than  the  value  of  their 
marginal product. Efficiency wage theories suggest that the higher the wage rate, the less likely are 
firings  because  of  reduced  shirking.  Workers  will  simply  not  run  the  risk  of  getting  fired. 
Furthermore,  a  back-loaded  wage-tenure  profile  may  induce  self-selection  of  high  productivity 
workers into such jobs. Finally, a high wage level means that the firm can more easily hire new 
people. Consequently, it can be more choosy and lay-off more people at an early stage of their 
careers.  The  same  argument  applies  to  workers,  since  their  wages  are  relatively  low  at  the 
beginning of their careers, which means that they will lose less when they change job with low 
tenure.  

Search theory gives similar predictions. Here workers search for jobs and if the worker receives a 
job offer better than the current job, she quits. Therefore, the higher the wage level in the current 
job, the lower the probability of a quit. Match theory says that workers with a high match quality 
are less likely to quit than those with a lower match quality. This has consequences for the quitting 
behaviour of different persons and will also mean that people who have been in a job for a long 
time will be more likely to stay.  

 The more recent theoretical and empirical background to the present study is a growing literature 
on  different  dimensions  of  personnel  composition.  It  is  well  documented  that  there  exist  large 
differences  between  firms  with  regard  to  pay  (Abowd,  Kramarz  and  Margolis,  1999),  tenure 
(Farber,  2000)  and  worker  flows  (Davis  and  Haltiwanger,  1999).  This  empirical  background 
provides  motivation  for  a  larger  theoretical  literature,  exemplified  by  Gibbons  and  Waldman 
(1999)  focusing  on  pay  and  to  a  smaller  extend  separations,  Lazear  (1999)  on  tenure  and 
Mortensen and Pissarides (1999) on worker flows. 

  A recent set of papers describes the empirical evidence for these pairwise relations. Barth (1997) 
finds no association between wage growth and tenure at the firm level. Kramarz and Roux (1998) 
also look at tenure and pay. Barth and Dale-Olsen (1999) find that higher wage level and higher 
wage  growth  reduce  worker  flows  for  medium  and  large  sized  firms.  Burgess  (1999)  looks  at 
worker flows and tenure across several countries.

 A  separate  strand  of  literature  has  considered  the  relations  between  these  various  labour  input 
measures and output measures of company performance. Leonard and Van Audenrode (1997) look 
at  worker  flows  and  productivity  and  find  a  negative  relation;  Leonard,  Mulkay  and  Van 
Audenrode  (1999)  find  higher  productivity  in  firms  with  higher  wage  levels  and  higher  wage 
growth; Abowd and Limieux (1996) look at pay and profit. 

The values of interest concerning personnel issues are the wage level, wage growth, the proportion 
of hires, the proportion of separations and average tenure. However, it is a reasonable and testable 
hypothesis that these factors all influence profit and may be simultaneously determined. The main 
contribution of this paper is that this simultaneity problem is addressed. We model the relationship 
between  personnel  and  profit  in  a  way  that  properly  takes  this  simultaneity  into  account.  The 
remainder  of  the  paper  is  organised  as  follows.  Section  2  describes  the  data,  illustrates  the 
variation in the dimensions of interest for measurement and details the empirical strategy. Section 
3 presents and discusses results; and section 4 summarises and draws conclusions. 

 

2. Data Description and Empirical Strategy 

 The data used in this study originates from the Statistics Denmark IDA (The Integrated Database 
for  Labour  Market  Research)  Register  and  the  Business  Statistics  Register.  IDA  contains 
information on labour market conditions for persons and workplaces in Denmark over the years 
1980-1995.  The  IDA  data  originates  from  various  administrative  registers  in  Denmark.  The 
important  feature  of  IDA  is  that  it  is  possible  to  associate  workplaces  with  the  identity  of  all 
employees  at  a  specific  day  in  November  (see  Leth-Sørensen,  1998).  For  this  paper  we  have 
matched  IDA  workplace  information  with  larger  firms  (business  units)  for  which  we  have 
accounting information 1992-95. 

The information on employees is quite comprehensive and contains data on 3 and 5-digit industry 
codes  (ISIC),  composition  of  work  force,  union  density,  total  employment  over  the  year,  and 
municipality. 

Education  is  measured  in  years.  Individual  labour  earnings  data  come  from  tax  records  and 
incorporate all labour income received in the year by an individual. Wage rates are subsequently 
calculated using the annual pension scheme contributions that are proportional to the number of 

 

5


hours worked. Firm size is measured as the number of primary workers in November. A primary 
worker means a worker that Statistics Denmark has determined has her/his main job at a given 
firm. 

We are  able  to  identify  which  workers  are  hired  in  a  firm and  which  leave,  all  measured  on a 
November to November basis. The limitation is that we are not able to identify those who have 
been  employed  say  from  December  to  January  the  following  year.  These  limitations  are  no 
different from the US LRD data used by Davis and Haltiwanger (1999) for example. The main 
difference is, however, that the IDA data allows us not only to identify the creation and destruction 
of jobs but also to identify the flows of persons between firms because we also know the identity 
of persons.  

We can follow each worker throughout her/his employment at the sampled firm. A hire in time t to 
t+1 is defined as a situation where the person is employed in the firm in time t+1 but was not 
employed there in time t. Similarly, a separation is defined where a person is observed in the firm 
in time t but not in t+1. For a given firm, job growth between two years, defined as hires less 
separations, gives a lower bound on job creation (destruction) if positive (negative), since intra-
firm re-allocation of workers among jobs is unobservable to us. Worker flows aggregate to the 
firm level as follows: 

(1)                          proportion of hires = hires/(hires+½(separations+stays)) 
(2)                          proportion of separations = separations/(hires+½(separations+stays)) 

The  sample  of  interest  consists  of  all  firms  in  the  Danish  private  sector  with  more  than  20 
employees at any time during 1992-95, the period for which we have economic information on the 
firms2.  These  firms  are  followed  throughout  the  period  and  matched  with  all  private  sector 
employees. Characteristics of the employees are aggregated to the firm level, which is the primary 
unit of analysis. Table 1 shows summary statistics. There are altogether 28,265 observations on 
7,118 different firms, which gives us almost 4 annual observations per firm over the period. The 
outcome  of  primary  interest,  Profit,  is  defined  as  value  added  minus  total  wage  costs.  Both  of 
these  measures  come  from  the  Danish  Business  Statistics.  Average  value  added  per  worker  is 
DKK  476,280,  average  wage  sum  is  DKK  241,590,  and  average  profit  per  worker  is  DKK

to be established.

234,690. The proportion of hires is 36%, and separations 37%. The average hourly wage rate is 
DKK 145 or about 20 euro. With an average working year of about 1600 hours, this adds up to the 
wage sum from the Business Statistics used above. Average real wage growth over the period is 
2%. Average tenure is found to be about 3.3 years. This should be seen against a censoring point 
of  6  years,  where  all  tenure  above  6  years  is  coded  to  6.  The  average  proportion  of  males 
employed  is  0.71,  the  average  level  of  education  is  11.3  years  compared  to  the  compulsory 
schooling since 1972 of 9 years. Average age is 35.7 years. The variable Union Density shows 
strictly speaking the proportion of the workforce that is member of an unemployment insurance 
fund, of 0.83. In most cases, membership of an unemployment insurance fund is associated with 
membership  of  a  trade  union.  Though  high,  the  standard  deviation  shows  that  there  is  some 
variation between firms.  

Denmark provides an interesting test site for studies on effects of turnover, because of few legal 
and  bureaucratic  constraints  on  lay  offs.  For  blue  collar  workers  there  exist  hardly  any  labour 
protection compared to what is known from the rest of Europe (except Switzerland and the UK in 
recent years). Only white collar workers have some statutory rights in the case of dismissals. In 
both cases, Denmark looks much more like the US than the rest of Europe. However, the main 
difference is here, that Denmark has a comprehensive system of unemployment benefits and state 
support to training and retraining. With these features in mind, you should expect that turnover in 
Denmark is even greater than in the US.

Having outlined the nature of the data set, it is useful preliminary to estimation, to statistically 
describe  the  variation  in  the  data  between  units  of  observation  (Table  2)  and  describe  raw  co-
variation between measures of interest (Table 3).  Heterogeneity 
firm 
performance  is  described  in  Table  2.  This  Table  contains  R2  goodness-of-fit  measures  of  the 
explanatory  power  of  a  regression  of  dummies  (defined  in  the  column  header)  on  variables  of 
interest (defined in the row header). For example, the first row and first column entry shows that 
firm-dummies  explain  76%  of  variation  in  profit-per-worker.  Variation  unexplained  in  the  first 
column must be due to variation over time, since the basic unit of observation is firm-year. This 
should be compared with variation within narrowly defined (SIC5 yields 500 unique) and more 
broadly defined (SIC3 yields 50 unique) product markets in column 2 and 3. It is easily seen that 
the vast majority of variation is at the firm level. The interpretation is that firms within an industry 

and 

 

7


are heterogeneous with respect to their resources and personnel policy. This is the case for hiring 
and separation behaviour and with respect to wage levels and wage growth.  

Columns 4 and 5 show product market-year effects, which further control for micro-cycles, but do 
not explain much more than column 2 and 3. Column 5 shows that the variation does not come 
entirely from a cycle, which is common to all markets. The final two columns show local labour 
market heterogeneity. We are here using dummy variables for each of the 275 municipalities and 
these dummies are interacted with year dummies. This observed heterogeneity would be used in 
the empirical model to provide exogenous variation (instruments) in personnel to identify effects 
on business outcomes. While this has even less explanatory power than broadly defined product 
markets, it remains to be tested whether such variation as remains is sufficient for identification. 

Raw  correlations  between  personnel  policy  and  business  outcomes  are  presented  in  Table  3. 
Aspects  of  personnel  policy  (hires,  separations,  wage  level,  wage  growth  and  tenure)  are 
correlated, as are measures of firm performance, but there is little correlation between the two. 
Thus, labour market and product market outcomes appear to be only weakly related in the raw 
data.  There  could,  of  course,  be  strong  associations,  which  are  confounded  by  raw  pair-wise 
correlations, without additional controls. Indeed, the premise of personnel economics is that such 
policies have tangible effects on business outcomes of interest.  

It  is  the  purpose  of  this  paper  to  model  the  associations  between  personnel  policy  and  firm 
performance,  moving  beyond  simple  correlations  by  accounting  for:  heterogeneity  by  way  of  a 
within-firm regression framework while controlling for a rich set of time-varying characteristics, 
and  modelling  the  simultaneity  of  business  performance  and  personnel  policy  by  way  of 
instrumental variables. 

We  are  interested  in  estimating  the  following  equation  in  order  to  analyse  the  determinants  of 
form profit: 

π
ft

=

X

ft

+

β γ ε υ
ft

Y

+

ft

where π is a vector of profits per worker for firm f in year t, X is a matrix of exogenous firm 
characteristics,  β  is  an  associated  vector  of  coefficients,  Y  is  a  matrix  of  endogenous  firm 
characteristics, γ is an associated vector of coefficients, ε is an error term specific to each firm but 
time-invariant, and ν is an idiosyncratic error term. Components of the Y matrix are elements of 

 

8


firm personnel policy: proportions of hires and separations, mean worker ongoing tenure, mean 
wage  level  and  mean  wage  growth.  Estimating  this  equation  directly  by  ordinary least squares, 
may lead to biased estimates of the coefficient vectors β and γ. This is because simultaneity in the 
determination of π and Y violates the orthogonality assumption on the error terms, required for 
this most desirable property of OLS.  

In this context the simultaneity problem can be remedied by proposing an instrumental variables 
estimator. What is required is a set of exogenous variables, over and above those already included 
in the X matrix, which determine personnel policy Y, but can legitimately be excluded from the 
set  of  determinants  of  π  directly.  Our  instrument  set  includes  the  mean  personnel  policies  of 
neighbouring firms. In particular, for each municipality we calculate the mean of the Y matrix for 
all establishments located there. Now for each firm we are interested in using as instruments the 
personnel policies of firms operating in the same local labour markets. The local labour market 
relevant  for  each  firm  can  be  characterised  by  the  most  popular  municipalities  that  its  present 
workers commute from. Arbitrarily, we select the most popular five home municipalities for the 
workers in each firm. It is the mean of the Y matrix from those five municipalities that we match 
to  each  firm  and  use  as  instruments.  The  use  of  local  labour  market  characteristics  to  provide 
instruments is valid subject to the assumption that local labour market conditions are exogenous 
for business location at the margin.3 

Our IV estimator is implemented by two-stage least squares. This involves estimating a set of first 
stage regressions, each explaining one endogenous variable: 

Y

X

Zα λ ε υ′

where Y1 is one endogenous variable, say hires, X is a matrix of exogenous controls as before, Z 
is a new matrix of instruments excluded from X, λ is an associated coefficient vector, the error 
terms  ε′  and  ν′  are  respectively  firm-specific  and  idiosyncratic.  This  first  stage  regression  is 
repeated for each vector of the Y matrix, obviously producing different estimated coefficients on 
the same matrices of explanatory variables X and Z. These first stage estimates can be used to 
make  linear  predictions  of  each  of  the  endogenous  variables.  The  useful  property  of  these 
predictions  is  that  they  are  correlated  with  the  endogenous  variable,  but  purged  of  spurious

correlation with the variable of primary interest, profit. In a second stage, these predicted values, 
containing useful variation are substituted in place of the observed endogenous variables. Subject 
to  a  correction  in  the  standard  errors  (to  account  for  the  fact  that  the  second  stage  regression 
includes variables which are themselves estimated with a variance) inference can proceed as in the 
regular OLS case, having now purged the estimates of endogeneity bias. 

Regression  coefficients  may  be  influenced  by  important,  but  unobserved,  firm  related  factors. 
Among these factors may be: market share and power in product markets, rent sharing, managerial 
effort and incentive schemes, technical efficiency, quality aspects of the labour force not covered 
by measured schooling, local labour markets, local wage levels and other regional effects. As far 
as these effects are constant over time, by making a within-firm transformation (fixed effects) we 
can control for these factors in estimation. A drawback is that we are unable to estimate the effects 
of time-invariant characteristics of the firm, such as industry and geographical location. 

3. Results and Discussion 

Results of estimating the model are reported in Table 4. As a consequence of the instrumentation 
procedure, and subject to the assumption of exogenous firm location, interpretation of estimated 
coefficients is direct from the model. 

More hires are associated with lower profit per worker. This is in accordance with the literature on 
costs of turnover, which emphasises the importance of recruitment and training. Separations are 
associated with higher profit per worker. One interpretation is that separating workers are among 
those  who  are  the  least  productive  or  most  over-paid.  If  separations  were  randomly  distributed 
over profit per worker, we would have expected a fall in profit by the amount of value added by 
the  average  worker,  less  her  wage.  Our  result  clearly  indicates  that  separations  are  far  from 
random,  and are  an  important  management tool. Gibbons and Waldman (1999) reach the same 
conclusion from extending arguments consistent with evidence in Gibbons and Katz (1991). High 
wage  levels  are  associated  with  more  profit  per  worker.  This  result  is  in  accordance  with 
efficiency wage and rent sharing theories. However, more Wage growth is related to lower profit. 
So it appears to be current pay, rather than fture pay prospects of workers within the firm which is 
related to higher profit today. More tenure, all else equal, has a negative relation with profit. This 
may seem surprising, since higher tenure is often associated with greater productivity due to firm-
specific  capital  accumulation.  However,  the  interpretation  is  for  a  given  wage  level.  In  this 

 

10


context, it may be a result of not being sufficiently active in laying off unproductive, or too highly 
paid senior workers.  

In  general,  the  significant  coefficients  on  personnel  policy  variables,  even  after  the  loss  of 
precision  due  to  instrumenting,  show  there  is  scope  for  managerial  action  in  personnel  policy 
which will have important relationship to profitability. 

The control variables are different from the above variables. First, they should all be judged on the 
basis that they are only capturing the effects of a change in the level compared to the firm average 
calculated  over  the  period  1992-1995.  Second,  endogeneity  is  not  controlled  for  and  estimates 
cannot be judged in a causal manner as above. 

Size, shows that increasing the number of jobs in the firm has a negative impact on the average 
level  of  profit  per  worker.  This  result  and  the  former  concerning  the  effects  of  hiring  and 
separations  suggest  the  presence  of  decreasing  returns  to  scale.  Changes  in  the  gender 
composition,  Male,  are  found  to  be  insignificant,  probably  because  the  gender  proportions  are 
quite constant, see Table 2.  

Moderate amounts of education are associated with high profit. Firms with either low of highly 
educated  workers  are  less  profitable. Age composition effects are such that young workers and 
older workers are associated with higher profit. The UI-density variable shows that increases in 
union  membership  are  associated  with  lower  profit.  Additionally,  there  is  an  indirect  effect  of 
greater union density via lower hires, a lower wage level, wage growth, lower tenure but higher 
wage growth.  

Finally, the time dummies show that the first three years of observation all have relatively low 
levels of profit. In 1995 profit increased with 146,000 DKK per worker compared to the preceding 
years. The years 1992 and 1993 were close to the bottom of the business cycle, where 1994 and 
1995 were years of upswing. It is likely that better business cycles will also have an impact on the 
costs of hiring and the gain in profit of separations. So far, we only have 4 years of observations, 
so we have little capability to extend the study in this direction for the time being. 

Instrumentation  diagnostics  fall  into  three  sets.  (1)  F-tests  with  the  null  hypothesis  that 
instruments  do  not  explain  the endogenous variable. These tests fail, and we conclude that our 
instruments do have explanatory power. (2) Durbin-Wu-Hausman tests with the null hypothesis 

 

11


that OLS is consistent. These tests fail, and we conclude that instrumental variables are preferable, 
since  they  are  always  consistent.  (3)  Over-identification  tests  the  null  that  instruments  are 
appropriately  excluded  from  the  set  of  controls  in  the  equations  of  interest.  This  test  fails  for 
worker flows, but is not rejected for tenure or wages. The primary effects of interest are those of 
wages on hires and separations. Since wage instruments are appropriately excluded from the set of 
controls, we can be comfortable with our inferences of primary interest. Arellano (1999) shows 
over-identification tests have low power in large samples, suggesting our partial rejection of the 
restrictions is less worrying.  

A numerical Example 
 
Finally, we have constructed an example to show the effects on profit of changes in the personnel 
policy made necessary in order to increase the long run employment with one more job. We use 
the average firm with 40 employees/jobs. Simple gross and net flow calculations show that for 
Denmark  3  hires  and  2  separations  are  needed  to create a new job on average (see Albæk and 
Sørensen, 1998). The estimated coefficients suggest that a 10% increase in the proportion of hires 
from the sample average of 0.3 reduces profit with DKK 171,000 per extra worker. At the same 
time, tenure has to change since we are employing 3 new workers with no tenure. If the rest of the 
workers have average tenure, the contributions from the new workers reduce tenure by 10% and 
that increases profit by DKK 138,000. Together, the hiring of 3 extra persons costs DKK 33,000 
each. That is about 1/3 of the wage costs. If the firm at the same time lays off 2 persons, profit 
increases  DKK  23,000.  As  these  are  assumed  to  have  average  tenure,  there  is  no  profit 
contribution from tenure. The overall loss in profit from hiring 3 and separating 2 is then about 
DKK 11,000. This operation results in the net hiring of one person and that has a separate negative 
effect on profit per extra worker of DKK 384,984/40=9600. Altogether, extending the work force 
with one person costs DKK 20,000 (2680 Euro). 

  

4. Summary and Conclusions 

Several aspects of the personnel structure of firms have been described recently in the empirical 
labour economics literature. This has largely been driven by new data sets linking many firms with 
many workers or looking at the personnel files of a single large corporation. Theoretical literature

has begun explaining selections of these new facts. Still further empirical papers have described 
links between selected features of firms’ personnel structure. The novelty in this paper is to draw 
together  the  most  comprehensive  picture  of  firms’  personnel  structure  to  date,  using  the 
population  of  7118  medium-to-large  Danish  enterprises  over  the  period  1992-95.  More 
importantly, in a simple setting, for the first time, we produce measures of the relations between 
personnel policies (on wages and turnover) and profit, which allows for the simultaneous nature of 
their determination. 

The  procedure  we  follow  allows  us  to  control  for  firm  heterogeneity  by  transforming  a 
longitudinal  matched  firm-worker  dataset.  We  address  the  potential  simultaneity  of  personnel 
policy  and  firm  performance  by  way  of  instrumental  variables  characterising  the  personnel 
structure of all other firms operating in the same local labour markets. Subject to our identifying 
assumption that location is exogenous to firm personnel policy decisions at the margin, we are 
able to make precise measurements of the relations between tenure, pay, worker flows and profit.  

We find that personnel policy, defined as wage level and growth and worker turnover, has a strong 
relation to firm economic performance. At the margin, more hiring is associated with lower profit, 
and more separations are associated with higher profit. For the average firm, one new job, created 
by three hires and two separations, is associated with DKK 20,000 (€ 2680) lower profit. Higher 
wage levels and lower wage growth are both associated with higher profit. A workforce that has 
less tenure, all else equal, is more profitable.  

These  results  are  consistent  with  survey-based  information  on  the  costs  of  hiring.  The  new 
empirical result is that separations may not be so detrimental to profit than hitherto believed and 
consequently that high tenure per se may not be so beneficial to profit as believed in much of the 
textbooks in labour economics and on management. We hope that this result will spur for new 
advances in the theoretical and empirical literature in this field.
