This paper examines relationships between human resource manage- 
ment  (HRM),  work  climate,  and organizational performance  in the 
branch network of a retail bank.  It extends previous research on group- 
level climate-performance  and HRM-performance relationships and 
examines how climate and HRM function as joint antecedents of busi- 
ness  unit  performance.  Significant correlations  are found  between 
work climate,  human resource practices,  and business performance. 
The results show that  the correlations  between  climate  and perfor- 
mance cannot be explained by their common dependence on HRM fac- 
tors, and that the data are consistent with a mediation model in which 
the effects of  HRM practices  on business performance  are partially 
mediated by work climate. 

Few organizations can evaluate their performance accurately by av- 
eraging the performance of  their employees.  In most cases, the per- 
formance of an organization is determined by the productivity and effi- 
ciency of  such higher-level organizational entities as departments, retail 
outlets, plants, or teams.  In the language of  operations research, these 
productive entities are called “decision-making units” (DMUs). DMUs 
can be compared to each other when they consume the same type of 
resources and produce the same type of  outputs.  Examples of  DMUs 
within an organization are branches of a bank, stores in a retail chain, or 
assembly lines in a factory. At a higher level, whole organizations in the 
same industry can also be treated as DMUs. 

Despite the practical importance of  DMU  performance for man- 
aging organizations, research on the psychology of  work effectiveness 
has historically been focused on performance outcomes at the individ- 
ual employee, rather than at the DMU, level.  Thus, in a recent meta- 
analysis of job attitudes and performance, Judge, Thoreson, Bono, and

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY 

Patton  (2001) were  able to locate  1,008 individual-level studies.  Al- 
though there can be little doubt that high levels of individual effective- 
ness are an essential component of  superior DMU performance,  it is 
nevertheless clear that  a description limited to the individual level is 
incomplete.  Many types of  organizational behaviour (e.g., social loaf- 
ing; Shepperd, 1993) and many indicators of organizational performance 
(e.g.,  customer satisfaction) exist only at the group level and have no ob- 
vious equivalent at the individual level. 

Nor can the antecedents of effective group-level performance be in- 
ferred solely from individual-level antecedents.  Consider, for example, 
a sales outlet whose customers and whose employees have either Spanish 
or English as their native language. Under a bonus scheme that rewards 
individual sales performance, an English-speaking salesperson may be 
tempted to close a sale with a Spanish-speaking customer to increase 
their bonus, instead of passing the customer to a Spanish-speaking col- 
league who might have a better chance of  making the sale.  In this ex- 
ample, an incentive scheme that may be highly effective for individual 
salespeople working on their own serves to depress performance at the 
DMU level. 

It seems reasonable to suppose that DMU performance is a function 
both of individual employee performance and the higher-level context in 
which the jobs are done. However, relatively little is known about DMU 
performance and its antecedents, and both Ostroff (1992, p. 969),  and 
Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996, p. 878) have argued for more research 
at this level of analysis. To date, two broad strands of empirical research 
have emerged. 

First, a number of researchers have found links between psycholog- 
ical measures of the work environment (climate, perceptions, attitudes, 
satisfaction) and performance at the DMU level.  For example, Ostroff 
(1992) demonstrated that school-average levels of  teacher satisfaction, 
commitment, adjustment, and stress were correlated with school effec- 
tiveness as measured by student achievement, attendance, and drop-out 
rates.  Likewise, West, Smith, Feng, and Lawthom (1998) found links 
between staff perceptions of climate and the research excellence of uni- 
versity departments. Similar relationships have also been found in com- 
mercial organizations. For instance, at the level of the whole organiza- 
tion, Kotter and Heskett (1992) showed that the perceived strength of 
a company’s culture is positively correlated with its long-term economic 
performance as measured by net income growth, return on investment, 
and increase in stock price over a 10-year period. 

One aspect of DMU performance that has attracted particular atten- 
tion from organizational researchers is customer satisfaction.  Schnei- 
der, for instance, has demonstrated that employees’ perceptions of cli- 


GELADE AND IVERY 

385 

mate correlate with customers’ ratings of  satisfaction in bank branches 
(e.g., Schneider & Bowen, 1985; Schneider, Parkington, & Buxton, 1980, 
Schneider, White, & Paul, 1998). Other authors reporting similar find- 
ings include Johnson (1996), Koys (2001), Rucci, Kirn, and Quinn (1998), 
Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996), and Schmit and Allscheid (1995). 
Other indicators of  DMU performance have also been linked to em- 
ployee attitudes and climate perceptions.  For example, reduced  staff 
turnover and superior financial performance are associated with positive 
attitudes (Ryan, Schmit, & Johnson, 1996), and sales performance with 
service climate (Borucki & Burke, 1999). Finally, Harter, Schmidt, and 
Hayes (2002) have shown weak, but meta-analytically generalizable, cor- 
relations at the DMU level between customer satisfaction, productivity, 
profit, staff turnover and accidents, and a composite index of  employee 
satisfaction and engagement. 

This body of  research is not without its weaknesses; some studies 
have used small numbers of  DMUs (e.g., Koys, 2001, n  = 28; Schnei- 
der & Bowen,  1985, n  = 28;  Schneider, Parkington, & Buxton,  1980, 
n = 23), and some of the most frequently cited (e.g., Kotter & Heskett, 
1992; Rucci, Kirn, & Quinn, 1998; Wiley, 1996) have not appeared in 
peer-reviewed journals.  Nevertheless, and despite some negative find- 
ings (e.g., Schneider & Snyder, 1975), the evidence to date suggests a rea- 
sonably consistent relationship between DMU performance and DMU 
aggregate measures of both employee satisfaction and work climate. 

In this paper, we shall focus on work climate rather than satisfac- 
tion. Although these two constructs are conceptually distinct (James & 
James, 1989; Kopelman, Brief, & Guzzo, 1990), from a measurement 
perspective they do exhibit considerable overlap; for example, at the in- 
dividual level, James and James (1989) report  an average correlation 
of .89 between overall job satisfaction and psychological climate.  Over- 
all, therefore, prior research points both  directly and indirectly to the 
conclusion that DMUs with favorable work climates outperform those 
with unfavorable climates. 

A second strand of research has investigated HRM (human resource 
management) factors as potential antecedents of  DMU performance. 
For instance, Arthur (1994) found that steel mills operating commitment- 
centered HRM systems have higher productivity, lower scrap rates, and 
lower employee turnover than  those with control-centered  HRM sys- 
tems.  Furthermore, Huselid (1995) found that HRM practices such as 
employee recruitment and selection procedures, compensation and per- 
formance management systems, employee involvement, and employee 
training have a significant impact on employee turnover and productiv- 
ity, and on short and long term corporate financial performance.  Sim- 
ilarly, Huselid, Jackson, & Schuler (1997) showed that HRM effective- 


386 

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY 

ness is associated with increased financial performance  as indexed by 
productivity, cash flow, and market value.  Youndt,  Snell, Dean, and 
Lepak (1996) showed that, particularly in the context of  a quality man- 
ufacturing strategy, employee productivity is higher in manufacturing 
plants where the HRM system is focused on enhancing human capital 
and, similarly, Patterson and West (1998) found significant influences 
of job design and employee skill development on the productivity and 
profitability of  small and medium sized U.K. manufacturing companies. 
In summary, the empirical evidence to date points to two distinct 
correlates of  enhanced DMU performance-favorable  work climates 
and progressive HRM policies and practices.  Given that DMU perfor- 
mance is associated both with work climate and HRM factors, we may 
envisage two conceptual models.  On the one hand, progressive HRM 
practices may  enhance both climate perceptions  and business perfor- 
mance. This raises the possibility that the observed associations between 
climate and performance are spurious (dependent on a common third 
factor) and that climate and performance are not causally connected. 
A second possibility, proposed by Kopelman, Brief, and Guzzo (1990), 
Huselid (1995), Delaney and Huselid (1996), and Ostroff and Bowen 
(2000) among others, is that climate is a mediating link between HRM 
and performance.  The conjecture here is that progressive HRM prac- 
tices foster a positive work climate, which increases employee well being 
and motivation, and this, in turn, leads to enhanced DMU performance. 
A conceptual model of this process has been described by Kopelman, 
Brief, and Guzzo (1990). In their model of organizational functioning, 
these authors argue that HRM practices designed to improve productiv- 
ity also influence one or more dimensions of work climate, conceived of 
here as “meaningful interpretations of  a work environment by the peo- 
ple in it” (p. 290). For example, changes in pay and promotion policies 
might be expected to alter employee perceptions of reward orientation 
and possibly of equity and fairness; similarly, the introduction of  train- 
ing programs, a practice that often improves productivity, is likely also 
to have a positive influence on employee perceptions of  task support. 
Work climate, in turn, is posited to influence the cognitive and affective 
states of employees in the workplace, in particular, work motivation and 
job satisfaction; and these psychological states serve to shape individual 
behaviours such as job performance and citizenship, which in turn have 
an effect on organizational productivity and performance. Patterson and 
West (1998) have presented some empirical evidence for such a medi- 
ating role of climate, although the sample size for their mediation tests 
was rather small (n = 37). 
As Becker and  Gerhart  (1996, p.  793) point  out, the influence of 
HRM  on DMU  performance  cannot  be  explained without  identifi- 


GELADE AND IVERY 

387 

cation of suitable intervening variables, and understanding the joint and 
interacting roles of HRM and climate is therefore a vital element in fur- 
thering our understanding of performance at the DMU level of analysis. 
Our purpose in this paper is thus to clarify the processes by which HRM 
and climate relate to each other and to DMU performance, and in this 
way to evaluate the climate-performance relationship within a broader 
context of DMU functioning than has hitherto been the case. 

The DMUs we shall describe are branch clusters of  a U.K.  retail 
bank, and the performance measures are staff retention, clerical accu- 
racy, customer satisfaction, and sales performance, all measured at the 
DMU level. 

As subunits of  a single organization, these DMUs follow a central 
HRM strategy and have many HRM procedures in common. However, 
there is considerable management discretion at the local level, leading, 
for example, to different systems for managing the workload, and differ- 
ent emphases on staff development.  It is the outcomes of these opera- 
tional decisions that we use as indicators of HRM practice in the DMUs. 
The HRM indicators we shall consider are staffing level (as a propor- 
tion of  the overall workload), working hours (represented by  the pro- 
portion of overtime), and professional development (represented by the 
percentage of staff with customer service qualifications). These opera- 
tionally defined indicators differ from the indicators of HRM that have 
been used in many previous studies of HRM and performance.  Wright et 
al. (2001) pointed out that most such studies have used single-respondent 
survey measures of strategic HRM practice, and demonstrated that such 
measures contain large amounts of  measurement error.  They further 
suggested that studies be conducted “at different levels of analysis where 
practices are more uniform and performance measures less distal from 
the effects of practices.” (p. 899) This study conforms with that recom- 
mendation by examining DMUs that operate within the common strate- 
gic HRM framework of  a single organization and by using HRM mea- 
sures that reflect local decision making within that framework. 

The study addresses two questions.  First, can the observed corre- 
lations between climate and DMU performance be explained by their 
common dependence on HRM decisions?  Second, does climate medi- 
ate the relationship between HRM decisions and DMU performance? 

Method 

DMU Definition 

The DMU for this study was the branch director group (BDG). The 
BDG is a geographically defined cluster of  bank branches, comprising 


388 

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY 

between 3 and 24 branches ( M  = 10.7) and employing between 95 and 
305 staff ( M  = 178). A branch director, responsible for the local con- 
textualization and implementation of bank policy, manages each BDG, 
and business performance is monitored centrally against annually de- 
fined targets.  The BDG is focused primarily on sales and service, with 
most transaction processing being carried out elsewhere in specialized 
centers. The BDG was chosen as the DMU rather than the branch partly 
because more performance data were available at this level, but primar- 
ily because it is effectively a self-contained business, with profitability 
and operational management responsibilities vested in the branch di- 
rector. There were 137 BDGs in the sample. 
BDG HRM and Performance Measures 

The HRM and performance measures described below were pro- 
vided by the bank. They were all drawn from the bank’s existing perfor- 
mance management systems rather than being gathered for the purpose 
of this investigation. 

Stajging level. Staffing level (actual staff level minus theoretical staff 
establishment), as a percentage of  the theoretical  staff establishment, 
averaged over the period May 2000 to March 2001. The theoretical staff 
establishment is derived from measures of  work throughput in which 
standard effort is associated with standard tasks such as opening a new 
account.  The maintenance of  appropriate staffing levels is a core re- 
sponsibility of the branch director. 

Overtime. The percentage of overtime hours worked per month, av- 
eraged over the period  May 2000 to March 2001.  (For the bivariate 
and multivariate analyses reported here, a square-root transformation 
of  overtime was used to improve normality.)  Overtime is viewed by the 
bank as a controllable cost and is a key part of the branch director’s re- 
sponsibilities. Local management is encouraged to minimize overtime. 
Professional development. The percentage of BDG staff certified as 
competent in the provision of  customer service.  For customer-facing 
staff, participation in the certification scheme is voluntary and certifi- 
cation is obtained through experiential training, which is accredited by 
an external provider of  vocational qualifications.  Assessors from the 
awarding body examine record books kept by  the candidates, observe 
their interactions with customers, and award certification to candidates 
judged to be fully competent.  The bank funds this training scheme and 
provides the infrastructure, but the development effort is supplied by the 
candidates. 
Sales against target. Overall personal sector sales in the period Jan- 
uary 2001 to April 2001 as a percentage of the target value of sales for 


GELADE AND IVERY 

389 

that period. Each BDG has a series of targets for sales to personal cus- 
tomers. These are weighted and aggregated to an overall personal sector 
target that takes into account the expected mix of business in the local 
area, thus providing a target that is theoretically immune to local market 
variations and unique to each BDG. Sales against target is regarded by 
senior management and BDG management as the single most important 
indicator of success. 

Customer satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction as measured by fully 
structured telephone survey. The data were gathered during a 3-month 
window from January 2001 to March 2001.  In the period in question, 
approximately 300 customers were interviewed per BDG. The interview 
consisted of  a series of  questions with Likert scale response options. 
Responses from customers who have visited their BDG branch in the 
past month are given a higher weighting in constructing the customer 
satisfaction score. 

Staff  retention.  The total number of  staff remaining in post in the 
period April 2000 to March 2001 as a percentage of the average number 
of  staff in post in the period. 

Clerical accuracy. The percentage of a particular information form, 
judged by top management to be important, completed correctly in the 
period January 2001 to March 2001. 

An index formed from the three HRM measures (staffing level, over- 
time, and professional development) had a low internal consistency and 
so these measures were not combined. However, a composite measure 
of  overall BDG performance computed by  averaging the standardized 
scores for sales against target, customer satisfaction, staff retention, and 
clerical accuracy had a reasonably satisfactory level of reliability (Cron- 
bach alpha .64) and this measure was used as an index of overall BDG 
performance. 

Employee Survey 

Measures of  BDG climate were derived from responses to an em- 
ployee opinion survey administered in three waves (February 2000, Oc- 
tober 2000, and February 2001), each covering approximately one-third 
of  the bank and producing returns from respectively 9,215; 7,582; and 
8,254 employees, at an overall response rate of 49%. The survey was de- 
signed by a commercial survey company to monitor employee opinion, 
not for the purposes of this study. Slightly different questionnaires were 
used in each wave, but there were 155 items common to all three waves, 
most of which had a 5-point Likert response scale. 

After eliminating questionnaires from non-BDG staff and those with 
more than 20% of  questions unanswered, there were 14,390 employee 


390 

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY 

questionnaires  available for  analysis.  The number of  questionnaires 
per BDG ranged between 30 and 284 ( M  = 107).  The majority of  re- 
spondents (72.6%) were women; 75.1 % of the respondents were clerical 
or supervisory staff, 12.5% were managers or assistant managers, 1.3% 
were senior managers or above, and the remainder were in other grades 
or did not indicate their grade. 

Construction of  Climate Scales 

Scale construction was conducted  at the individual employee level 
and was based on factor analysis of  all retained questionnaires.  After 
eliminating items that had low response rates or an inappropriate re- 
sponse scale, there were 149 items suitable for factor analysis. Item re- 
sponses were scored one to five, higher numbers being associated with 
more favorable responses. 

One problem we encountered was that the questionnaire contained 
a substantial number of consecutive pairs (and some triplets) of similar 
items with the same stem.  Items in such pairs and triplets were some- 
times highly correlated, suggesting a method effect that would produce 
spurious (i.e., method) factors. We therefore conducted a principal com- 
ponents analysis on the 149 items using the technique of radial parceling 
(Barrett & Kline, 1981; Cattell & Burdsall, 1975) that we have previously 
found useful in extracting interpretable factors from this type of  ques- 
tionnaire.  In this procedure, the items are first subjected to a parceling 
algorithm that identifies pairs of  items with similar loading patterns in 
the unrotated component matrix, similarity being assessed by the con- 
gruence coefficient. The algorithm proceeds by searching for the pair of 
loading patterns with the highest congruence and eliminating this pair 
from subsequent searches. Searching stops when there are no more pairs 
of items with a congruence coefficient above a specified minimum. The 
algorithm then attempts to assign each of the remaining unpaired items 
to one of the previously constructed item pairs to form an item triplet. 
Triplets are accepted if  the average congruence between pairs of items 
in the triplet exceeds the specified minimum. The minimum congruence 
coefficient was set at .75, and in this way, 61 two-item parcels and nine 
three-item parcels were created, all parcels having a congruence coeffi- 
cient of .78 or higher. Next, parcel scores for each case were computed 
by  averaging the item scores within each parcel and the parcels were 
subjected to principal components analysis.  This procedure recovered 
10 components, explaining 65.8% of  the variance of  the parcel corre- 
lation matrix.  All the components were readily interpretable following 
Oblimin rotation. 


GELADE AND IVERY 

391 

Parcels were assigned to each scale in accordance with the rotated 
component structure, but ignoring parcels with low loadings (i.e., not 
belonging to any specific component) or complex loadings (i.e.,  belong- 
ing to more than one component.)  Seven components were identified 
as climate indicators. Scale lengths, scale reliabilities, and sample items 
are presented in Table 1. 

The climate dimensions recovered here may be located within the 
conceptual spaces of  organizational climate described by  James  and 
James (1989),  and by  Kopelman,  Brief,  and  Guzzo  (1990).  Coach- 
ing, Leadership, and Local Management cover between them much of 
the space delineated by James and James’s second-order climate factor 
Leader Support and Facilitation.  Goal Clarity would appear to corre- 
spond to James and James’ first-order factor role Ambiguity (reversed), 
and to be part of Kopelman et al.3 goal emphasis. Rewards clearly falls 
within Kopelman et al.’s Reward Orientation, and Job Challenge within 
James and James’ second-order factor Job Challenge and Autonomy; 
Job Enablers can be clearly located within Kopelman et al.’s Task Sup- 
port. However, no dimensions were recovered directly corresponding to 
James and James’ Work Group Cooperation, Warmth, and Friendliness, 
or to Kopelman et al.’s Means Emphasis or Socioemotional Support. 

The average correlation between the scales was .56  and, in addition, 
principal components analysis of the seven scale scores recovered a sin- 
gle component explaining 64% of the variance of the scale score correla- 
tion matrix. This suggests the existence of a higher-order climate factor 
underlying employee perceptions. This factor appeared to be conceptu- 
ally equivalent to the general psychological climate factor (PCg) identi- 
fied by James and James (1989). According to these authors, PCg rep- 
resents all emotionally relevant work-related cognitions and reflects the 
degree to which the work environment is perceived as personally bene- 
ficial or detrimental to one’s well being; evidence for such a hierarchical 
factor has also been reported by Parker (1999).  Accordingly we aver- 
aged the scores on the seven first-order scales to create a summary scale 
that we labeled General Climate (see Table 1). 

Aggregation 

Although organizational climate is measured through individual per- 
ceptions, the appropriate unit of analysis is the organization or organi- 
zational subunit.  To  obtain climate scores at the appropriate level of 
analysis, it is thus necessary to aggregate individual employee scores to 
the group level, and it has been suggested that aggregation is justifiable 
only if there is a minimum degree of consensus among the respondents 
in the group (James, 1982; Joyce & Slocum, 1984).

There are several reasons to expect that a degree of consensus might 
exist  at the BDG level.  First, employees within a BDG interact with 
each other. Staff are often directed, either routinely or exceptionally, to 
work at other branches within their BDG to cope with temporary peaks 
in workload or sickness.  Furthermore, staff with a common role also 
attend regular meetings at BDG level, and key events for employees, 
such as the annual pay awards and major social events, are coordinated 
at BDG level. It has long been known in the social sciences that people 
can and do exert a strong influence on each other’s beliefs, attitudes, 
and behaviors (e.g., Allport,  1935; Turner, 1991), and as Sechrist and 
Stangor (2001) demonstrated, learning whether one’s beliefs are or are 
not shared with others influences attitudes, behaviour, and the strength 
of  the attitude-behaviour  relationship.  Interactions  among staff thus 
provide a basis for the evolution of commonly held job-related opinions 
and beliefs among employees within a BDG. 

Secondly, differences in BDG local strategies, such as the priority 
accorded to training, the implementation of workload-sharing systems, 
and the relative emphasis placed on the sales and service functions, pro- 
vide opportunities for distinct BDG characteristics to evolve, and sug- 
gest that aggregated BDG climate scores would reflect genuine group 
differences. 

Glick (1985) has argued that the best statistic for justifying aggrega- 
tion is ICC2, the reliability of the mean group score. ICC2 was .88, well 
above the accepted minimum criterion of  .7.  In addition, ICC1, the in- 
dividual level intraclass correlation, was .07, and a maximum-likelihood 
variance components analysis showed that 7.4% of  the variance in cli- 
mate scores was attributable to the BDG. Overall, therefore, aggrega- 
tion to the BDG level seems justified on both substantive and statistical 
grounds and, accordingly, BDG climate scores were calculated by aver- 
aging individual climate scores within each BDG.

Univariate Statistics and Bivariate Correlations 

Table 2 shows univariate statistics and bivariate correlations between 

the study variables. 

The correlations reported in Table 2 are largely in accordance with 
expectations and with previous research.  First, General Climate cor- 
relates  positively with sales against target,  staff retention, clerical ac- 
curacy, customer satisfaction, and overall performance.  This confirms 
previous research that favorable perceptions of  the work environment 
are associated with elevated DMU performance.  Secondly, the results

provide additional evidence for the impact of  HRM factors on business 
performance.  High levels of  overtime are associated with lower levels 
of sales against target, clerical accuracy, staff retention, and overall per- 
formance; increased staffing levels are associated with elevated scores 
on all performance outcomes except sales against target; and increased 
levels of professional development are associated with enhanced perfor- 
mance on all business outcomes. In addition, all three HRM indicators 
are significantly correlated with General Climate, a finding consistent 
with the view that positive HR practices contribute to employees’ sense 
of  well being.  Finally, we note that there  are significant correlations 
between the business outcomes, and in particular, correlations between 
customer satisfaction and sales have also been reported by Rucci, Kirn, 
and Quinn (1998), for example. 

HRM-Climate-Pe$omance  Relationships 

To  test  the possibility that  the observed relationships between cli- 
mate and performance are due to the common influence of  HRM de- 
cisions, we computed partial correlations between general climate and 
each of the performance outcomes while controlling simultaneously for 
the three HRM variables: staffing level, overtime, and professional de- 
velopment. The partial correlations (df  = 121) were, respectively: sales 
against target, T  = .30, p < .001; clerical accuracy, T  = .lo, ns; staff re- 
tention, T  = .24, p  < .01; overall performance, T  = .30, p = .001; and 
customer satisfaction, T  = .12, ns. Comparing these correlations with 
the corresponding zero-order correlations in Table 2, we see that of the 
five significant climate-performance correlations in Table 2, three (sales 
against target, staff retention, and overall performance) remain signif- 
icant, and only the correlations for clerical accuracy and customer sat- 
isfaction become nonsignificant when the HRM variables are partialled 
out.  This demonstrates that the climate-performance  correlations ob- 
served here cannot be explained by a common correlation with the HRM 
variables. 

Next, we examined the role of  climate as a mediator between each 
of  the three HRM variables and the BDG performance outcomes.  In 
the procedure advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986), mediation effects 
are determined by analysis of separate regression equations. However, a 
convenient alternative is to estimate a path model as shown in Figure 1, 
where the box labelled HRM represents an HRM decision variable and 
the box labelled performance outcome represents a BDG performance 
indicator.  In this model, the direct effect of  the HRM variable on per- 
formance is represented by path c,  and the indirect (mediation) effect 
by  paths a and b.  If a, b,  and c are path coefficients, the strength of the

mediation effect is a x b, and the percentage mediation (i.e., mediation 
effecthotal effect) is given by a x b/(a x b + c). In the analyses described 
below, model parameters were derived using the full-information maxi- 
mum likelihood estimation procedure of the AMOS modelling program 
(Arbuckle, 1999). This estimation method can handle missing data, so 
each model was estimated using all 137 BDGs.  To  ensure the model 
was identified (solvable), the path coefficients from the error variance 
components were set to one as shown in Figure 1. 

Fifteen different path models were estimated (one for each combi- 
nation of HRM and performance outcome) and the results are shown in 
Table 3. 

The first three data columns of Table 3 show the path coefficients for 
the paths depicted in Figure 1, and the next column shows the percentage 
of variance in the performance outcome accounted for by the indepen- 
dent variables in the model. This is followed by the percentage media- 
tion, with the significance level for the null hypothesis of no mediation, 
based on a test of  the joint significance of  a and b, which MacKinnon, 
Lockwood, Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002) recommend as yielding 
the best combination of Type I error rate and statistical power. 

The results show that sizeable proportions of  the variance in BDG 
performance can be accounted for by climate and HRM decisions. Us- 
ing Cohen’s classification of  effect sizes for the variance explained in a 
dependent variable (2% small, 13% medium, 26% large; Cohen, 1998,

pp. 412-414), the results show that the model explained variance effects 
for sales and staff retention are medium, the effects for customer satis- 
faction are small to medium, the effects for clerical accuracy are small, 
and the effects for overall performance are medium to large. 

In addition, significant mediating effects of  work climate were ob- 
tained for five of the HRM-climate-performance  models using individ- 
ual performance outcomes, and all three of the models using overall per- 
formance.  Overall, these results provide clear support for the role of 
work climate as a partial mediator between HRM practices and DMU 
performance. 

Limitations 

The findings of this study should be interpreted within the context of 
its limitations.  First, the observations are of  a single organization and 
the extent to which they are representative of organizations in general, 
or even of  service organizations in general, can be determined only by 
reference to the work of other researchers. 

Next, what is presumably a causal system has been examined here 
using cross-sectional data. That is, although the performance indicators 
postdate the climate and HRM measures, each variable is represented 
in the data only at a single point in time.  This does not necessarily in- 
validate the conclusions that may be drawn because time-lagged corre- 
lations suggest that BDG performance is reasonably stable.  The mean 
correlations between consecutive quarters for BDG staffing level, over- 
time, and staff retention are respectively .78, .71, and .51 (df = 137); 
additionally, the correlation between consecutive 2-month periods for 
sales against target is .65 (df = 134), and the correlation between BDG 
customer satisfaction for September 2000 and the first quarter of  2001 
is .68 (df = 135). 

Finally, the mediation model we describe is not the only model that 
could have been constructed to fit the observed data; it is well known 
that  a causal model can usually be replaced by  one or more  equiva- 
lent models with identical fit characteristics (Loehlin, 1992, p.  194) and 
the choice of model rests on substantive and theoretical considerations. 
The issue of substance here is the directionality of the link between cli- 
mate and performance; to simplify, does climate cause performance or 
does performance cause climate?  In this case, reversing the direction 
of causal flow between climate and performance leads to a theoretically 
plausible model in which performance is the mediating variable; that is, 
effective HRM decisions enhance performance, which in turn leads to 
positive employee attitudes. Cross-sectional data cannot distinguish be- 
tween these possibilities; longitudinal data is required.  However, the

evidence from longitudinal studies is mixed.  Ryan, Schmit, and John- 
son (1996) found that customer satisfaction predicted subsequent em- 
ployee satisfaction, but that employee satisfaction did not predict subse- 
quent customer satisfaction, evidence that performance causes climate 
rather than vice-versa.  West et al. (1998) found that research  ratings 
predicted subsequent climate in university research departments more 
strongly than climate predicted  subsequent research  ratings, conclud- 
ing that climate was an outcome of  performance rather than a cause. 
On the other hand, Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996) found the direc- 
tion of  the link between morale and productivity to be indeterminate, 
and more emphatically, Koys (2001) found clear evidence that climate 
causes performance; specifically, employee satisfaction predicted sub- 
sequent customer satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviour 
predicted subsequent profits (rather than the other way round).  Fur- 
thermore, Patterson and West (1998) found that significant relationships 
between climate, HRM factors, and performance remained when prior 
performance was partialled out. 

Thus, although alternative models with reversed directionality can- 
not be conclusively ruled out, the model presented here is not incompat- 
ible with the weight of current evidence, and is broadly consistent with 
previous conceptions of the antecedents of DMU performance, and with 
the temporal ordering of the variables that were measured. 

Finally, we  note that the mediation  model presented  here almost 
certainly represents a considerable simplification of  the complex, and 
possibly reciprocal, system of  causal relationships that  characterize a 
sophisticated commercial DMU.  For  example, low sales effectiveness 
may be a consequence of low customer satisfaction, which itself may be a 
consequence of high staff turnover. Furthermore, we might suppose that 
high levels of turnover may cause chronically low staffing levels, which 
in turn might lead to increased overtime demands and to a depressed 
work climate, thus reducing sales effectiveness.  We  have carried  out 
exploratory structural modelling showing that such a circular system of 
relationships would indeed be compatible with the observed data. 

Discussion 

Many features of the results described here are consistent with prior 
research at the DMU level of  analysis.  However, there are also some 
differences between this study and prior research on customer satisfac- 
tion.  Some service researchers have proposed that customers are influ- 
enced by the attitudes expressed by the service employees they encounter 
(e.g., Schneider & Bowen, 1992; Ulrich, Halbrook, Mecker, Stucklik, & 
Thorpe, 1991).  This supposes that satisfied employees radiate positive 


400 

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY 

affect, producing an emotionally satisfying sales experience for the cus- 
tomer.  However, in this study, the correlation between general climate 
and customer satisfaction is rather weak, and the strongest correlates of 
customer satisfaction are staffing level, staff retention, and professional 
development. Transfer of affect does not seem to be a wholly satisfactory 
explanation for these results. 

Examination  of  individual items in the customer satisfaction tele- 
phone survey showed that the correlations of staffing level with ratings 
of staff politeness, empathy, and friendliness were between .30 and .32, 
(df = 137,p < .OOl),  but the strongest correlate of staffing levelwas ease 
of contact (T  = .59, df = 137, p < .OOl).  Thus, although customers of 
understaffed outlets do experience less positive affect, their main source 
of dissatisfaction seems to be the low levels of responsiveness that such 
outlets provide. 

Staff retention was the strongest correlate of  customer satisfaction. 
One explanation is that in DMUs with high levels of turnover, customers 
are more likely to encounter inexperienced employees, who are less able 
to provide an efficient service.  Two findings support this view.  First, 
there is a positive correlation between staff retention and professional 
development, which means that high turnover BDGs have fewer qual- 
ified staff.  Secondly, high turnover BDGs have lower levels of clerical 
accuracy, an indication of inefficiency. However, the nature of the sales 
encounter between the customer and employee may moderate the staff 
turnover-customer satisfaction relationship. Consistent with the present 
findings, Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996) observed a correlation be- 
tween turnover and customer satisfaction in a financial services orga- 
nization,  but  no correlation between turnover and customer  satisfac- 
tion was observed in either Koys’ (2001) study of  restaurants, or Rucci, 
Kirn, and Quinn’s (1998) study of  a department store.  Speculatively, 
where the relationship between customer and employee has a confiden- 
tial component, or is of an advisory nature, a satisfying commercial en- 
counter may depend on being recognized by  a service employee or on 
being served by  an employee familiar with the customer’s transaction 
history, as well as upon professionalism and efficiency. In DMUs with 
high levels of turnover, established customers are less likely to encounter 
such employees and may accordingly report reduced levels of  satisfac- 
tion.  In summary, although customer satisfaction levels may be partly 
determined by affective influences, there are reasons to suppose that in 
some circumstances, other factors may be equally, or more, important. 
Turning to the joint relationships between HRM, climate, and per- 
formance, the finding that significant associations between climate and 
performance remain after partialling out the common effects of HRM 
supports the conception of a direct relationship between climate and per- 


GELADE AND IVERY 

401 

formance, which is independent of HRM decisions. Secondly, the medi- 
ating effect of climate observed here is consistent with the empirical find- 
ings of Patterson and West (1998) and with the suggestions of previous 
writers that progressive HRM practices influence organizational perfor- 
mance partly by enhancing climate. There are also, however, strong di- 
rect links between HRM decisions and performance that are indepen- 
dent of climate and that are consistent with expectations. For example, 
both understaffing and overtime working imply elevated job demand, 
which is widely accepted to be a potential source of stress and depressed 
individual performance; conversely, encouragement of professional de- 
velopment is likely to increase individual effectiveness.  These factors 
may  underlie the direct  links between HRM  and DMU performance 
found here. 

The joint role of climate and employee satisfaction as mediators be- 
tween HRM and performance remains to be established empirically. In 
the models of Kopelman, Brief, and Guzzo (1990), and by  Ostroff and 
Bowen (2000), satisfaction and motivation are conceived as a mediating 
link between climate and organizational performance, so that climate is 
more distal and employee satisfaction is less distal to organizational per- 
formance.  This would seem to be a fruitful avenue for future research 
but, for the present, we note that the correlations between climate and 
performance obtained here are noticeably larger than the mean absolute 
uncorrected value of .13 obtained by Harter, Schmidt, and Hayes (2002) 
for the correlations between a composite index of employee satisfaction 
and engagement and DMU performance. 

Conclusion 

This study builds on previous research showing that favorable psy- 
chological environments in the work place, and progressive HRM prac- 
tices such as management of job demand and support for professional 
development, are associated with superior organizational performance. 
The model of DMU functioning that we have described incorporates cli- 
mate and HRM outcomes as joint and interrelated antecedents of DMU 
performance and accounts for proportions of the variance in DMU per- 
formance that are significant in both statistical and practical terms. 

In addition, we  found that  the relationships between  climate and 
DMU performance cannot be explained by their common dependence 
on HRM factors.  However, the data were compatible with a model in 
which HRM decisions have both a direct and an indirect influence on 
performance.  In this model, HRM decisions exert their indirect effect 
by enhancing or depressing the work climate, which, in turn, produces 
subsequent changes in DMU performance.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY 

Understanding the impact of HRM decisions on employee attitudes 
and behavior, and the potential effects on organizational performance, 
has considerable practical importance for local management as well as 
for central HR practitioners.  In large  organizations, where  decision 
making is partially decentralized, local HRM decisions are often strongly 
influenced by considerations of  their associated operating costs.  The 
cross-sectional relationships demonstrated in this study provide empiri- 
cal evidence that HRM decisions, climate, and DMU performance are 
connected, but more research-especially longitudinal research-is 
re- 
quired to establish the extent of causality in this domain. 

Many organizations routinely collect HRM and performance data 
and conduct climate or employee attitude surveys, but this information is 
often compartmentalized at departmental levels. Academic researchers 
who would like access to this data need to offer clear benefits to partici- 
pating organizations-for  example identification of best and worst prac- 
tice and recommendations for performance improvement-to  compen- 
sate for the often considerable effort that is needed to integrate these 
various data sources.  We would recommend close collaboration with 
psychologists and human resource practitioners working in such organi- 
zations who are often well placed to collate such information and have 
an interest in using the outcomes of the analysis to inform their decision 
making.  If  data can be collected on a longitudinal basis, it might prove 
possible to evaluate HRM decisions in terms of their long-range impact 
on business performance, rather than just in terms of  their immediate 
impact on operating costs.
