Abstract

In the context of privatization and restructuring in Russia, we test two standard agency theory hypotheses, namely, (1) outside
board members and (2) new managers are positively related to ﬁrm performance. Based on a survey of 314 privatized ﬁrms, the
evidence offers little support for the hypotheses. Historically, results refuting theories have been launch pads for scientiﬁc
progress. Our ﬁndings, therefore, raise interesting questions about whether the underlying theory is appropriate, whether there
are methodological problems, or whether there are institutional factors in Russia’s transition economy that need to be accounted
for when we test agency theory in a new setting. We address these questions and discuss their implications for corporate
governance theory, practice, and public policy.

1. Introduction

In the last two decades, the worldwide scale and
scope of privatization have grown tremendously
(Megginson & Netter, 2001). The participation of
Russia and other transition economies in this move-
ment has truly made it global (Svejnar, 2002). Yet,
after the initial euphoria associated with political and
ownership transitions is over, how to govern the
privatized corporation becomes an immediate concern

(Wright, Hoskisson, Filatotchev, & Buck, 1998;
Young, Peng, Ahlstrom, & Bruton, 2002). More than
a decade after large-scale privatization was unleashed
throughout
transition economies, we now have a
cumulative body of empirical knowledge from a vari-
ety of countries (reviewed by Megginson & Netter,
2001; Djankov & Murrell, 2002; Estrin, 2002;
Havrylyshyn & McGettigan, 2000; Wright, Buck, &
Filatotchev, 2002) suggesting the following three pro-
positions concerning the privatized ﬁrm:

1. Privatization to insiders (managers and employees),
without external governance pressures, is hardly
conducive for needed restructuring (e.g., Buck, Fila-
totchev, & Wright, 1998; McCarthy & Puffer, 1995).
2. Outside ownership, preferably concentrated in the
hands of blockholders, funds, foreigners, and/or

banks, is more likely to facilitate restructuring
(e.g., Filatotchev, Hoskisson, Buck, & Wright,
1996; Filatotchev, Buck, & Zhukov, 2000).

3. When incumbent management fails to deliver
desirable performance, performance is likely to
improve when new managers are brought in (e.g.,
Barberis, Boycko, Shleifer, & Tsukanova, 1996;
Frydman, Gray, Hessel, & Rapaczynski, 1999).

Underlying these three propositions is agency the-
ory, which concentrates on the inherent conﬂict
between principals and agents (Jensen & Meckling,
1976). While private ownership is believed and shown,
in general, to be superior to state ownership (Meg-
ginson & Netter, 2001), a single round of privatization
does not appear to solve agency problems at many
ﬁrms in Russia and other transition economies. In this
regard, privatization may be best viewed as a neces-
sary but insufﬁcient condition for improved perfor-
mance. Overall, these three propositions highlight the
signiﬁcant post-privatization challenges in corporate
governance.

Extending the literature, we raise a critical question:
Do outside owners and new managers actually
improve performance in privatized ﬁrms? This
exploratory study addresses this question by testing
the second and third propositions above. Grounded in
agency theory, we hypothesize the positive impact on
ﬁrm performance made by new owners (represented
by outside directors) and new managers, and present
evidence from 314 privatized ﬁrms surveyed in Rus-
sia. Our provisional results challenge the validity of
these propositions, and raise interesting new questions
with regard to how to govern the privatized ﬁrm in
Russia and other transition economies.

2. Privatization: theory and practice

In theory, privatization may help minimize agency
problems and lead to greater efﬁciency by improving
monitoring systems and providing agents with better
incentives to perform (Boycko, Shleifer, & Vishny,
1995, 1996). Upon privatization, effective restructur-
ing by the new owners would presumably follow
(Boycko et al., 1995: 150). However, in practice,
the ﬁrst phase of privatization in Russia, from 1992
to 1994, only partially solved problems of state-owned

enterprises (SOEs). As shown by a voluminous litera-
ture, such privatization, resulting in extensive insider
control, does not necessarily lead to restructuring of
former SOEs, especially the large ones (Djankov &
Murrell, 2002; Estrin, 2002; Wright et al., 2002).
Much of what has been reported about the resurgence
of new entrepreneurship in Russia applies to smaller
privatized ﬁrms, usually in the retail and service
sectors, as well as private start-ups (Barberis et al.,
1996; Havrylyshyn & McGettigan, 2000; Peng, 2001;
Puffer & McCarthy, 2001). At large former SOEs, the
objectives of new inside owners typically have little to
do with restructuring for better performance. Rather,
nonmanagerial employees (hereafter ‘‘employees’’)
are mostly interested in job security. Although they
now control substantial shares, employee control may
not necessarily be an optimal governance structure,
since the heterogeneity among employees increases
the costs—and reduces
reaching
restructuring decisions (Earle & Estrin, 1996). More-
over, employees are in ‘‘a particularly vulnerable
position’’ as shareholders wishing to inﬂuence impor-
tant decisions and threatening to ‘‘exit’’ (Buck et al.,
1998: 96). Many of them rely on the ex-SOE not only
for income but also a host of other beneﬁts, such as
housing, health care, and recreation. The tradition of
‘‘one factory, one town’’ in many parts of Russia leads
to few viable, alternative employment opportunities in
the local labor market. As a result, employee owner-
ship poses few restraints on management’s power.
Most bluntly, Boycko and colleagues (1996: 317)
argue that employee control may simply be ‘‘bad
for restructuring.’’

the speed—of

Having largely become ‘‘agents without princi-
pals,’’ managers may be most interested in establish-
ing signiﬁcant control of the newly privatized ﬁrms.
This may have resulted in the self-interested entrench-
ment of former SOE managers, who may be unqua-
liﬁed for their new roles and able to delay restructuring
(Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000). These agency pro-
blems are magniﬁed in the context of most privatized
Russian ﬁrms, which generally lack other governance
mechanisms such as securities markets whereby dif-
ferent teams of investors and managers can contest for
corporate control. Overall, despite privatization, little
restructuring has occurred to improve efﬁciency and
performance in many large ﬁrms controlled by incum-
bent managers after the ﬁrst phase of privatization

(1992–1994) (Buck et al., 1998; Filatotchev et al.,
1996, 2000). McCarthy and Puffer (1995) argue that
these managers are simply ‘‘muddling through’’
responding to the crisis of the day as it occurs while
not being interested in deep restructuring. Overall,
instead of reaching a ‘‘triumphant completion’’ as
claimed by Boycko and colleagues (1995: 8), the
challenges to govern and restructure the privatized ﬁrm
in Russia seem to be far from over (Aslund, 1995).

3. The role of outside directors and
new managers

3.1. Introducing outside directors

Inﬂuenced by an agency theory proposition that
‘‘the presence of large outside investors is conducive
to efﬁciency’’ (Boycko et al., 1996: 318), the Russian
government launched a second phase of the privatiza-
tion program in 1994 with the objective of attracting
more outside investors to restructure former SOEs. In
order to make such investment more attractive to
outside investors, the government set a limit of 10%
share ownership for insiders, rather than the 51% cap
allowed during the ﬁrst phase (McCarthy & Puffer,
1995: 59). Given that outside investors are typically
reluctant to provide capital to restructure ﬁrms whose
boards are completely controlled by insiders, it is
common practice for outside investors to insist on
certain control rights through their representatives on
the board. Among these outsiders, ‘‘small’’ outsiders
are individual investors, while ‘‘large’’ ones are bloc-
kholders, who control more than 5% of the shares, such
as strategic investors, investment funds, banks, holding
companies, and foreign investors. While shares held by
small outside investors have remained relatively stable,
large outside investors have substantially increased
their share, which may facilitate more restructuring
(Barberis et al., 1996; Frydman et al., 1999).

Largely shaped by agency theory, corporate restruc-
turing research places an emphasis on the monitoring
role of outside board members (Dalton, Daily, Ell-
strand, & Johnson, 1998). Outside directors are
expected to be more closely aligned with outside
investors’ interests, to monitor top management deci-
sions more effectively, and thus, to lead the ﬁrm to
better performance. Research in the West suggests that

following poor performance, ﬁrms typically add out-
siders to their boards (Hermalin & Weisbach, 1988).
Similarly, in Russia, it is precisely poor ﬁrm perfor-
mance that has led to increased outside investment,
and hence, the introduction of outside board members,
who may facilitate more restructuring (Filatotchev
et al., 2000). Thus:

Hypothesis 1: In privatized Russian ﬁrms, the pre-
sence of outside board members is positively asso-
ciated with ﬁrm performance.

3.2. Introducing new managers

Privatized Russian ﬁrms not only need new outside
board members, but also new managers capable of
restructuring and leading ﬁrm growth (Puffer, 1992,
1994; Peng & Heath, 1996). Jensen (1987: 104) argues
that ‘‘[incumbent] managers often have trouble aban-
doning strategies they have spent years devising and
implementing, even when these strategies no longer
contribute to the organization’s survival. It is easier for
new top-level managers with no ties to current
employees or communities to make changes.’’ In
privatized Russian ﬁrms, a number of studies docu-
ment the entrenchment of existing managers, who
obtained most of their experience during the socialist
era (Blasi, Kroumova, & Kruse, 1997; Filatotchev
et al., 1996, 2000; McCarthy & Puffer, 1995; Earle
& Estrin, 1996). Such managerial control, ‘‘while far
superior to state ownership, . . . gives managers too
much control relative to what is needed to speed up
efﬁcient restructuring’’ (Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996:
77). Although some incumbent managers may be
interested in restructuring,
they typically lack the
necessary skills and capabilities (Puffer, 1994).

As a result, there is an urgent need to replace the old
guards with a new generation of managers. Approxi-
mately 10% of the Russian CEOs1 were removed at
the ﬁrst shareholder meeting by coalitions of outside
investors and employees (Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996:
74). Overall, between 1992 and 1996, one-third of the
privatized Russian ﬁrms replaced their CEOs (Blasi
et al., 1997: 203). While such a pace of managerial

article, we use the term ‘‘CEOs’’ to avoid confusion with the
directors on the board.

turnover is very impressive, Russian ﬁrms may need
even faster turnover of old-guard managers (Shleifer
& Vasiliev, 1996).

Since the managerial labor market is underdeve-
loped in Russia, most new managers are likely to be
insiders (Earle & Estrin, 1996). Blasi and colleagues
(1997: 203) ﬁnd that only less than 20% of the new
CEOs came from outside. Although new, inside man-
agers may continue to pose agency problems asso-
ciated with insider control discussed earlier, these new
managers may still be better than old ones. This is
because new managers are typically younger, more
adaptive, and less inﬂuenced by the old way of SOE
management. More importantly, some of them may
have acquired skills that would enable them to func-
tion better in a more competitive, market-driven econ-
omy (Puffer, 1992, 1994; Peng, 2000, 2003). As a
result, they may be more likely to undertake aggres-
sive restructuring aimed at performance improvement.
In this regard, managers’ age may be a good
measure to assess the inﬂuence of the old system
and exposure to the new environment (Hambrick &
Mason, 1984). Blasi and colleagues (1997: 203) report
a steady decline of Russian CEOs’ age over the years.
Speciﬁcally, the average age of CEOs in ofﬁce before
1992 was 52 years old, and the average age of those in
ofﬁce since 1992 declined to 47. Among the latter
group, the average age of those named CEOs in 1995
went down to 45. In addition to the CEO, the average
age of other top managers in privatized Russian ﬁrms
also experienced a decline (Blasi et al., 1997). There-
fore, it is reasonable to expect that even in the case of
continued insider control, the presence of new man-
agers may still lead to relatively more restructuring
and better performance. Stated formally:

Hypothesis 2: In privatized Russian ﬁrms, the pre-
sence of new top managers (both insiders and out-
siders) is positively associated with ﬁrm performance.

4. Methodology

4.1. Research design

The study was carried out in late 1995 and early
1996, approximately 3 years after the beginning of the
ﬁrst phase of privatization in Russia. Building on

previous surveys in Russia published elsewhere (Buck
et al., 1998; Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000), a ques-
tionnaire was ﬁrst constructed in English, and was
then translated into Russian by one of the authors who
is a native speaker of Russian and by an ofﬁcial in the
Center for Economic Reform in the Russian govern-
ment. The Russian version was then back translated
into English to ensure accuracy.

The questionnaire was ﬁrst piloted in face-to-face
interviews with two respondents at each of ten priva-
tized ﬁrms in Moscow. Given the sensitive nature of
our inquiry, a mail survey would probably have led to a
low response rate. Therefore, we relied on trained
interviewers to survey managers on site. The selection
of this method was also driven by our interest to gather
more insightful data from face-to-face interviews. One
senior manager, usually the CEO, was interviewed.
After covering survey items, respondents were invited
to provide additional, open-ended information. The
pilot study revealed, with the falling novelty value of
Western surveys, the general infeasibility of multiple
respondents from a single ﬁrm in Russia. The method
of single-respondent surveys thus became unavoidable
and is consistent with almost all other published
surveys conducted in Russia (e.g., McCarthy & Puffer,
1995; Barberis et al., 1996; Earle & Estrin, 1996;
Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000; Blasi et al., 1997; Buck
et al., 1998).

Besides difﬁculties in obtaining multiple responses
from a single ﬁrm, other problems require unique
methodological solutions in Russia due to the break-
down of the Soviet Union. While the State Commis-
sion for Statistics (Goskomstat) was able to supply
information on SOEs and their characteristics in the
USSR before 1991, privatization in Russia and most of
the former Soviet republics tended to be decentralized
and regional
in character, with no national body
collecting detailed statistics. This effectively ruled
out quota and stratiﬁed sampling and left only reliance
on the central limit theorem: If samples were ran-
domly drawn, then as their sizes increased, sample
means tended to be normally distributed around the
population mean. Such a sampling methodology cor-
responded broadly with the methodology used by the
World Bank (Blasi et al., 1997) as well as a host of
other surveys. In our case, six independent groups of
Russia-based professional surveyors were instructed
to collect large samples of manufacturing ﬁrms of

different sizes and a variety of industries in different
locations. The result was a sample of 314 relatively
large ﬁrms (Table 1) in six major industrial regions
(Chelyabinsk, Ekaterinburg, Moscow, Nizhny Nov-
gorod, Perm, and St. Petersburg). Even intended ran-
dom surveys in Russian could result in convenience
samples because of surveyors’ local contacts. How-
ever, one could expect differing patterns of conveni-
ence in six different regions, thus leading to ‘‘quasi-
random’’ samples.

On average, sampled ﬁrms had been privatized 31
months earlier, with a standard deviation of 9 months.
Almost a third of them were in machinery, 20% in
light manufacturing, and the remainder in a variety of
manufacturing industries. The average employment
size of our sampled ﬁrms was 1,632, which was
similar to the average size of ﬁrms reported in other
major surveys (e.g., 1,983 in Blasi & Shleifer, 1996
and 1,802 in Blasi et al., 1997).

4.2. Measures

4.2.1. Dependent variables

Previous research suggests that, in the absence of
archival data, self-reported performance measures are

acceptable and often equally reliable when care is
taken to obtain data from reliable informants (Dess &
Robinson, 1984). In this case, most respondents were
CEOs, who were in the best position to know their
ﬁrms’ performance.

While in general performance measures can be
accounting- or market-based,
the underdeveloped
ﬁnancial markets in Russia rendered accounting-based
measures to be our only choice. We focused on pre-tax
proﬁts and return on investment (ROI) as two key
performance measures. These were widely used by
managers in making capital decisions. Unfortunately,
the Russian economy experienced annual average
consumer price hyperinﬂation of 1,526% in 1992.
During the survey years of 1995 and 1996 it was still
at levels of 198 and 48%, respectively (EBRD, 1997:
233). With inﬂation at such high levels, obtaining an
accurate measure of ﬁrm performance based on ‘‘con-
stant price’’ calculations was almost
impossible.
Therefore, we used a seven-point Likert scale to
measure relative changes in these two measures.
Speciﬁcally, respondents were requested to indicate
whether their ﬁrms’ real pre-tax proﬁts and return on
investment, during the past 12 months (a) decreased
more than 20%, (b) 10–20%, (c) less than 10%, (d) had
no change, or (e) increased less than 10%, (f) 10–20%,
or (g) more than 20% (see Appendix A).

Besides hyperinﬂation, another problem with man-
agers’ perceptions of ﬁnancial performance was that
this measure might be inﬂuenced by the systematic
under-reporting of proﬁts in the face of exorbitant
corporate tax rates (Maddy & Ickes, 1998).2 The use
of Likert scale rather than ruble measures of proﬁt and
returns reduced but did not eliminate this problem
(we will refer to this problem again in the discussion of
ﬁndings).

4.2.2. Independent variables

The board structure of privatized Russian ﬁrms is
complex. While the majority of ﬁrms seem to have a
single board comprising executives and outside direc-
tors in an approximation to the Anglo-American

2 For example, one enterprise reported that ‘‘it had to pay a basic
profit tax of 38%. This is in addition to a municipal tax of 1%, 3%
for garbage collection, 2% in property tax, and 10% in ecological
tax amounting to a total of 54% of its profits. In other cases, the
basic profit tax could be much higher’’ (Aslund, 1995: 204).

model, a minority have adopted German-style, two-
tier boards, where the shareholders appoint a super-
visory board, which in turn appoints managers to an
otherwise separate executive board. In practice, how-
ever,
these distinctions are often blurred. Russian
supervisory boards can be manned entirely by inside
managers and employees without any outsiders, just as
executive boards can include outside directors and a
few insiders. Under
it was
decided to observe the presence of outside directors
on the single board and/or supervisory or executive
boards, whenever appropriate. In this regard, our
method of relying on on-site interviewers was far
superior to other methods such as a mail survey, since
interviewers could clarify with the respondents about
the actual board structure and then guide them through
the answers.

these circumstances,

At the time of our survey, 84 of the sampled ﬁrms
were classiﬁed as ‘‘closed joint stock companies,’’
which were not legally able to have outside directors.
Therefore, only 230 respondents provided information
on outside directors on the board. Respondents were
asked to indicate whether a particular category of
outside investor was represented on the board(s).
Among the 230 ﬁrms whose respondents provided
information, 33% had outsiders on a supervisory
board, and 27% reported outsiders on an executive
board.

With respect to managerial turnover, we asked (a)
whether the CEO had been replaced, and (b) whether
other top managers had been replaced. Since the
construct of ‘‘top managers’’ may entail a relatively
large number of people, we limited the measure to
those executive directors who were on either a single-
tier board or on the lower, executive board in a two-tier
board structure. The rationale was that if a manager sat

Table 2

on the board as an inside director, he or she would
naturally be a top manager. Among sampled ﬁrms,
24% had new CEOs, and 34% had some new executive
directors on the board.

4.2.3. Control variables

Firm size has long been recognized in corporate
governance research (Dalton et al., 1998). The size
effect may be especially relevant in Russia, in light of
anecdotal evidence suggesting that larger privatized
ﬁrms are more entrenched while smaller ones are more
entrepreneurial (McCarthy & Puffer, 1995; Barberis
et al., 1996). Firm size can be measured by assets or
employment. Given Russia’s hyperinﬂationary econ-
omy, measuring ﬁrm size according to their asset
values would introduce too much noise. Despite the
wide ﬂuctuation of asset values, the employment level
at most large Russian ﬁrms has been relatively stable
(Aukutsionek, 1997). Therefore, we used the ﬁrms’
employment level as a measure for ﬁrm size, which on
average had 1,632 employees and a standard deviation
of 2,919.

In terms of hypothesis testing, we deployed the
ordered probit regression analysis using LIMDEP
statistical package since our dependent variables are
not continuous, and the analysis provides a scaled
subjective evaluation of the (unobserved) continuos
variables (Greene, 1993).

board members (who represent outside investors) and
new managers on the one hand, and ﬁrm performance
on the other hand. Ordered probit estimates fail to
provide support for these two standard, agency theory
hypotheses at any p < 0:05 level.

Speciﬁcally, in Table 3, the eight models, using
different combinations of independent variables, yield
resoundingly consistent results. In Models 1 and 2, the
effect of outside directors is estimated. In Models 3
and 4, we focus on the effect of new managers. In
Models 5 and 6, these two sets of independent vari-
ables are combined. To explore links between govern-
ance factors and performance further and beyond
hypothesized linear relationships, in Models 7 and 8
we estimate whether there is any interaction effect
between the two sets of independent variables. In
particular, the interaction between outside directors
on the supervisory and/or executive board(s) and a
new CEO may have some positive impact on perfor-
mance. However, estimates in Models 7 and 8 explor-
ing these potential interactive effects again refute such
thinking.

6. Discussion

6.1. Questions about agency theory

Is agency theory appropriate? Based on decades of
research dating back to Berle and Means (1932),
agency theory is not only inﬂuential among scholars,
but also widely accepted by the practitioner community
and the business press in the West (Jensen, 1987).
Moreover, the theory has played a major role in transi-
tion economies (Peng, 2000, 2004; Young et al., 2002).
Western agency theorists such as Andrei Shleifer,
Robert Vishny, and Joseph Blasi have been directly
involved with the Russian privatization program as
foreign advisors, and Russian agency theorists such
as Maxim Boycko and Dmitry Vasiliev have served in
key government positions in charge of privatization.

The agency theory logic behind our hypotheses
seems to be straightforward, robust, and uncontrover-
sial. With regard to Hypothesis 1, ‘‘there is near
consensus in the conceptual literature’’ on the role
of outside board members (Dalton et al., 1998: 270).
Hypothesis 2, on the role of new managers, is not only
widely endorsed by agency theory (Jensen, 1987) but

also by an emerging empirical literature on transition
economies, primarily from Central Europe—but less
so from Russia and other former Soviet republics
(Megginson & Netter, 2001; Djankov & Murrell,
2002). Therefore, given agency theory’s rich intellec-
tual tradition, strong practitioner support in the West,
and widespread application in transition economies, it
may be difﬁcult to conclude that the theory is inap-
propriately applied in this empirical context.

6.2. Questions about methodological limitations

How about potential methodological problems?
Our methodology followed an interview-based, key-
informant design used by virtually all other published
surveys conducted in Russia cited earlier. One poten-
tial weakness of our methodology is our measure of
the presence, as opposed to proportion, of outside
board members and new top managers. While even-
tually, it may be the proportion of outside directors and
new managers that counts, during the immediate after-
math of the ﬁrst phase of the privatization program,
there was widespread consensus that some new blood
(i.e., the presence), even if they were a minority, would
at least help initiate post-privatization restructuring
(Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996). In any case, most ﬁrms
having outside directors on their board typically had
only one or two such members and dominance by
outside board members was not realistic in Russia
during the time of our survey (Blasi et al., 1997: 201).
Under these circumstances, our focus on the presence
of outside directors and new managers is appropriate,
since such presence would qualitatively differentiate a
ﬁrm from others completely entrenched by incumbent
managers (Boycko et al., 1996: 318).

Another potential methodological weakness lies in
the self-reported nature of our data, which, similar to
data used in other published Russian survey studies,
could not be triangulated for the whole sample. It is
plausible to question whether Russian managers may
be used to reporting ‘‘politically correct’’ information
(i.e., ‘‘painting rosy pictures’’). Two lines of defense
can be invoked. One is the assumption that managers’
bias is not systematically correlated with the objects of
inquiry. As long as our informants, who might have
bias, did not always over- or under-report data by a
certain margin, the data would still be acceptable. In
other words, our data, like all other data, may contain


356

M.W. Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360

errors, but not systematically. A second widely-used
tactic is to employ large-sample data in the knowledge
that biases would be canceled out to some extent. In
comparison with the sample size of other major
surveys (e.g., 142 in Blasi & Shleifer, 1996, 139 in
Buck et al., 1998), our 314 ﬁrms represent a respect-
able sample size.

One feature of the Russian enterprise environment
that could lead to the under-reporting of proﬁts and
rates of return is the increasingly exorbitant corporate
tax rates over the period studied. Our use of managers’
perceptions of returns on a Likert scale reduces the
likely impact of this phenomenon, since these percep-
tions cannot be compared with tax returns in any
detailed manner. Nevertheless,
increasingly under-
reported returns are a realistic problem, and it is at
least possible that new outside directors may have
been hostile to this established enterprise practice,
thereby reducing reported performance. Subsequent
studies in more stable periods with a ﬂat-rate corporate
tax rate are needed.

Finally, the lack of support for our hypotheses may
be simply a matter of survey timing. Although on
average, the 314 ﬁrms had been privatized 31 months
earlier at the time of survey, the range was between 2
and 61 months. While the ofﬁcial, ‘‘top-down’’ Rus-
sian privatization program started in 1992, there were
numerous cases of spontaneous, ‘‘bottom up’’ priva-
tization before the ofﬁcial program began (Filatotchev
et al., 1996). Unlike some other surveys which only
include ﬁrms privatized since 1992 (Earle & Estrin,
1996; Blasi et al., 1997), our survey includes some
ﬁrms which were privatized ‘‘spontaneously.’’ The
longest post-privatization history of the sampled ﬁrms
was 61 months, which suggested that these ﬁrms were
privatized in 1990. Nevertheless, the inclusion of these
ﬁrms, which leads to a more conservative test of the
hypotheses, still does not generate supportive evi-
dence. It appears that even for ﬁrms with a longer
post-privatization history, they still may not have had
enough time to recover.

Overall, it is important to note that our study is not
the only one that fails to support agency theory
hypotheses. Dalton and colleagues’
(1998: 282)
meta-analysis, involving 54 studies and 159 samples
(with a total n size of over 40,000) in the West, reaches
a very strong conclusion that ‘‘the true population
relationship across the studies . . . is near zero.’’ In

China, Peng (2004) similarly refutes agency theory
predictions on the positive role of outside directors on
ﬁnancial performance. Although none of the cited
surveys conducted in Russia formally tests our
hypotheses,
their results are similar to what we
obtained. Speciﬁcally, they ﬁnd that, despite a growing
involvement of new investors and new managers, there
has been little restructuring and negligible perfor-
mance enhancement at large privatized ﬁrms. There-
fore, given the care taken in our research design, the
largely mixed results from empirical studies else-
where, and the consistent ﬁndings from surveys in
Russia, we believe that it may be problematic to
attribute the lack of support for the hypotheses to
potential shortcomings in our methodology.

6.3. Questions about institutional context

In the end, what about institutional factors that may
need to be accounted for in the Russian context? Given
the ‘‘path dependent’’ nature of each country’s devel-
opment (North, 1990), any attempt to explore manage-
rial behavior in a country such as Russia ‘‘requires an
understanding of the institutional framework in which
the ﬁrm is embedded’’ (Peng & Heath, 1996: 501).
Research has shown that the institutional structures in
emerging economies differ signiﬁcantly from those
familiar in the West (Hoskisson, Eden, Lau, & Wright,
2000; Meyer, 2002; Peng, 2000, 2003). There are at
least four unique institutional factors that may have
contributed to our ﬁndings. First, Russian managers,
even those relatively younger and more ‘‘Wester-
nized,’’ display a strong collective mentality which
dates back to Czarist Russia and has been reinforced
by the socialist legacy (Welsh, Luthans, & Sommer,
1993; Puffer, 1994). As a result, even those new
directors and managers from the outside may be less
willing to initiate large-scale restructuring, downsiz-
ing, and layoffs. In addition, standard agency theory
assumes to some extent the availability of able and
qualiﬁed managers on the outside labor market for
executives, and this may be a heroic assumption in the
Russian context (Filatotchev et al., 1996).

Second, while Russian directors and managers may
be unwilling or unable to initiate restructuring, foreign
investors may also be limited in their ability to push for
these changes. By 1996, they only controlled approxi-
mately 1.6% of total Russian equity, thus necessarily


M.W. Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360

357

limiting their ‘‘voice’’ (Blasi et al., 1997: 193). Even
when sitting on the board, they often do not challenge
the Russian managers, in fear of political reaction
(Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996). In addition to their limited
‘‘voice’’ on boards, the discipline of an ‘‘exit’’ threat
implicit in outside shareholders may be largely absent
in Russia as a result of signiﬁcant barriers to share
transfers largely established unlawfully by incum-
bents. Under
these circumstances, hypothesized
agency theory-based relationships between outside
ownership and ﬁrm performance may be nulliﬁed.

A third institutional reason behind the lack of
support for the hypotheses may be a function of
macroeconomic conditions. Privatization in Russia
occurred during a period of hyperinﬂation, demand
collapse, and penal rates of corporate taxation. For
example, in 1995 during our survey period, retail price
inﬂation averaged 198%, private consumption fell by
24%, and gross ﬁxed investment fell for the fourth
consecutive year (EBRD, 1997: 233). In such a harsh
environment, even the most capable managers would
have had a hard time making a difference. Given
Russian managers’ general lack of familiarity with
the workings of a market economy (Puffer, 1992,
1994; Peng, 2000), it is not surprising that the ﬁrms
they led did not
show signiﬁcant performance
improvement. In addition, high tax rates may have
led to increasingly under-reported returns.

Finally, in a dynamic environment, outside board
members may have more difﬁculties in assessing and
monitoring top management actions. While existing
research focuses on turbulent environments in the
West
(Zajac & Westphal, 1994; Li & Simerly,
1998), it follows that the more turbulent environmen-
tal dynamism may reduce the effectiveness of outside
board members in Russia. For example, newly-
appointed board members may be unable to monitor
the sales performance of senior managers when inﬂa-
tion rates are so volatile.

7. Implications for future research and practice

This study contributes to the literature by being
among the ﬁrst ones to directly test and challenge the
two standard agency theory-based propositions on the
positive role of outside owners and new managers in
governing the privatized ﬁrm. The results, though

statistically insigniﬁcant, are not without wider impor-
tance, and lead to a number of implications for cor-
porate governance theory, practice, and public policy.
For scholars, we are not optimistic that a straightfor-
ward application of agency theory in a transition
economy characterized by a great deal of institutional
differences compared with the West would be fruitful.
We would not, however, suggest that outside board
members and new managers do not have an impact on
ﬁrm performance in Russia. Under conditions of
unrelenting turbulence, the few people at the top of
a ﬁrm make a world of difference to its competitive-
ness and vitality. A potentially promising avenue for
future research may be the introduction of institutional
factors that may have a direct or moderating impact on
the focal relationship (North, 1990). Since most scho-
lars would agree that institutions matter in transition
economies such as Russia, the next step is to tackle the
harder and more interesting issues of how they matter
(Peng, 2003: 276). As discussed earlier, future work in
this area needs to take into account (1) Russian
managers’ collective mentality, (2) the limited role
of foreign investors, (3) the impact of macroeconomic
conditions, and (4) the impact of different strategic
choices moderated by the environment, among others.
Such institutional dynamics may lead to more
informed theory (Buck et al., 1998; Peng, 2003).

For practitioners and policy makers, our study is a
the mere acquisition of
cautionary reminder that
shares in privatized Russian ﬁrms is likely to change
little by itself. Any performance improvement as a
result of outside, foreign investment is likely to occur
only when insiders concede the need for new invest-
ment and when outside investors secure some degree
of inﬂuence over major decisions in order to prevent
incumbents from behaving dysfunctionally. This inﬂu-
ence can be exercised through the outsider ‘‘voice or
exit’’ threat. Although a Russian legal code is in place
to protect the rights of outside investors to representa-
tion within the ﬁrm and to transfer their shares on
capital markets,
it has been routinely ignored by
deﬁant inside managers. These managers, for exam-
ple, may infringe the rights of genuine outside min-
ority shareholders by setting up ‘‘pocket’’ companies
of their own as investors in company shares, as a
means of concealing their insider control (Blasi et al.,
1997: 66). Policy makers should concentrate their
efforts on the enforcement of shareholder rights in


358

M.W. Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360

order to facilitate more post-privatization restructur-
ing and improve ﬁrm performance.

It has been argued that during the time of our survey,
the only signiﬁcant constraint on manufacturing ﬁrms
we surveyed came from product markets, as many
factories stood idle and demand for products dimin-
ished signiﬁcantly (Buck et al., 1998). Financial mar-
kets exerted considerably less pressure (McCarthy &
Puffer, 1995). In a market economy, it is the interac-
tion of the product and capital markets that combines
to discipline ﬁrms (Nickell, 1996). In the longer run, it
is clear that privatization and restructuring cannot be
successful without active ﬁnancial markets whereby
manufacturing ﬁrms, as well as their board members
and managers, can be disciplined should they fail to
deliver value-added to shareholder wealth (Jensen,
1987; Peng, 2004). Therefore, constructing adequately
regulated ﬁnancial markets would be of paramount
importance.

At the same time, it must be recognized that our
survey took place only a short time after the comple-
tion of the centralized privatization in 1994, and this
meant only a short time for ﬁrms to achieve perfor-
mance turnarounds. There is a strong case here for
longitudinal surveys, although longer time periods
may introduce more opportunities for exogenous
events to inﬂuence performance as well as giving
more chances for privatization itself to have an effect.
Some of these external changes could be beneﬁcial to
the study. For example, a period of more stable tax
rates could reduce any anxieties about the under-
reporting of enterprise returns alluded to above. We
would, however, submit that, while we recognize the
need for studies that produce updated and longitudinal
data, our study does offer a baseline on which sub-
sequent studies may be developed.

right place, at the right time. Historically, ﬁndings
refuting theories have been launch pads for scientiﬁc
progress (Kuhn, 1970). Researchers may make larger
contributions by focusing on corporate governance in
transition economies, since currently we know so little
about them (Young et al., 2002). These economies
offer fascinating grounds to test and reﬁne existing
theories and develop new ones (Buck et al., 1998;
Peng, 2003). As the ﬁeld matures, the last thing we
need is the parochial thinking that dominates main-
stream organizational research. In conclusion, we
argue that a globally valid agency theory must accom-
modate the speciﬁc experiences of managers, direc-
tors, and ﬁrms in transition economies that have been
the central focus of this study.

8. Conclusions

Appendix A

Exploratory and provocative research tends to gen-
erate more questions for continued research than it
answers. In light of the globally mixed ﬁndings on
agency theory-based predictions in the West (Dalton
et al., 1998) and in China (Peng, 2004), our results in
Russia are puzzling: Maybe such relationships simply
do not exist, or, if they do, their magnitude is insig-
niﬁcant. Alternatively, we may have not searched the
