REPUTATION AND CELEBRITY ON EARNINGS SURPRISES

AND INVESTORS’ REACTIONS

The effects of intangible assets on organizational outcomes remain poorly understood. We
compare the effects of two intangible assets—firm reputation and celebrity—on (1) the
likelihood that a firm announces a positive or negative earnings surprise, and (2) inves-
tors’ reactions to these surprises. We find that firms that have accumulated high levels of
reputation (“high-reputation” firms) are less likely, and firms that have achieved celebrity
(celebrity firms) more likely to announce positive surprises than firms without these
assets. Both high-reputation and celebrity firms experience greater market rewards for
positive surprises and smaller market penalties for negative surprises than other firms.

The intangible assets of firms have attracted con-
siderable interest in organizational and strategy re-
search (e.g., Barney, 1991; Deephouse, 2000; Di-
erickx & Cool, 1989; Fombrun, 1996; Greenwood,
Li, Prakesh, & Deephouse, 2005; Itami & Roehl,
1987; Rindova, Pollock, & Hayward, 2006). In par-
ticular, scholars have focused a great deal of atten-
tion on a subclass of intangible assets that we call
“social approval assets,” because they derive their
value from favorable collective perceptions. These
assets are posited to provide firms with sustainable
competitive advantages (Barney, 1991; Dierickx &
Cool, 1989) and have been subject to a number of

studies intended to assess their performance bene-
fits (e.g., Barnett, Jermier, & Lafferty, 2006; Deep-
house, 2000; Fombrun, 1996; Hall, 1992; Jensen &
Roy, 2008; Podolny, 2005; Rao, 1994; Rindova, Wil-
liamson, Petkova, & Sever, 2005; Roberts & Dowl-
ing, 2002).

Much of this research, however, has focused on
establishing the general effects of possessing social
approval assets on firm performance and has given
little consideration to whether the specific effects
of different assets may vary. Further, this research
has often given different labels to the same types of
collective perceptions or has used the same observ-
able proxies to operationalize conceptually distinct
constructs (see Deephouse and Carter [2005], Deep-
house and Suchman [2008], and Rindova et al.
[2005] for recent critiques highlighting these issues).
As a result, labels and definitions have proliferated,
making it difficult to determine if different studies
consider the same or different phenomena, leading to
a fragmented body of work and limiting the develop-
ment of theory that can explain and predict the effects
of different intangible assets. Thus, despite the large
number of studies examining the performance con-
sequences of social approval assets, a coherent
body of knowledge about the differences in these
assets and their effects has not been developed.

In this study, we begin to address these questions
by first theorizing about the effects of two types of
social approval assets—reputation and celebrity—
on firms’ propensities to generate unexpected out-

comes, and on stakeholders’ responses to these
outcomes. “High reputation” refers to the accumu-
lation of high levels of public recognition of the
quality of a firm’s capabilities and outputs (King &
Whetten, 2008; Rindova et al., 2005), whereas “ce-
lebrity” refers to “a high level of public attention”
focused on a firm combined with “positive emo-
tional
from stakeholder audiences”
(Rindova et al., 2006: 51). We focus on outcomes
that deviate from prior expectations because they
require stakeholder audiences to make sense of
these deviations, drawing on the interpretative
frames that social approval assets provide. Reputa-
tion and celebrity are “social facts” that constitute
distinct interpretative frames that are likely to in-
fluence stakeholder behaviors in different ways
(King & Whetten, 2008; Rindova & Fombrun, 1999).
Further, we consider how their effects may vary
under different conditions by considering both pos-
itive and negative deviations from expectations.

Two sets of theoretical arguments provide the
foundation for our empirical investigation. First,
we draw on strategy and organizational research on
firm reputation and celebrity to articulate how the
differences in the actions and behaviors involved
in building these assets may affect a firm’s propen-
sity to generate unexpected outcomes. Second, we
draw on research in psychology to theorize how
these different actions and behaviors may generate
different types of social approval having different
effects under positive and negative conditions.

We empirically test the effects of possessing high
levels of reputation and celebrity on firms’ propen-
sities to announce earnings surprises and on inves-
tors’ reactions to these surprises. Earnings surprises
occur when a firm’s actual earnings deviate from
market analysts’ consensus estimates (Degeorge,
Patel, & Zeckhauser, 1999). Earnings surprises are
positive when the announced earnings exceed an-
alysts’ estimates and negative when the announced
earnings fail to meet their estimates. Both types of
surprises violate investors’ expectations of predict-
able earnings and negatively affect the accuracy of
financial evaluations
(Degeorge et al., 1999;
Kasznik & Lev, 1995; Tan, Libby, & Hunton, 2002;
Williams, 1996). Further, negative surprises not
only violate expectations of predictability, but also
reflect disappointing firm performance and can
elicit strong, negative responses from investors
(Brown, 2001; Kasznik & Lev, 1995; Skinner, 1994;
Skinner & Sloan, 2002). Positive surprises, on the
other hand, are viewed more ambivalently. Al-
though they affect the predictability of a firm’s per-
formance and hence the accuracy of market fore-
casts,
they are, nevertheless, signals of good
performance; as a result, they usually generate rel-

atively smaller, but positive, responses from inves-
tors (Brown, 2001; Kasznik & Lev, 1995; Skinner &
Sloan, 2002; Westphal & Clement, 2008). These
variations in the effects of positive and negative
surprises provided an opportunity to empirically
examine the effects of different social approval as-
sets under different circumstances.

In the following sections, we first discuss our
research setting, focusing on earnings surprises as
unexpected outcomes. Next, we develop the theo-
retical arguments that explain why and how the
possession of reputation or celebrity is likely to be
associated with different outcomes. We then de-
velop and empirically test hypotheses about firms’
propensities to surprise and investors’ reactions to
positive and negative surprises when they occur.

THEORY DEVELOPMENT

Research Setting: Material Earnings Surprises as
Unexpected Outcomes

Scholars in accounting and finance have studied
positive and negative earnings surprises because
they are aberrations that interfere with the smooth
and efficient functioning of markets (e.g., Tan et al.,
2002). Analysts’ forecasts are important for market
efficiency because investors rely on these authori-
tative predictions of firm performance to properly
value a firm’s stock (Degeorge et al., 1999; Wil-
liams, 1996). Accordingly, managers strive to facil-
itate and improve their firms’ valuations by avoid-
ing earnings
surprises and meeting analysts’
consensus estimates (Degeorge et al., 1999). Thus,
meeting analysts’ earnings expectations either ex-
actly or within a few cents is the norm.

Yet earnings surprises do happen. They occur for
a variety of reasons related to both a firm’s actions
and events beyond its control. For example, recent
negative surprises have been blamed on lower-
than-expected sales (Gaffen, 2008) and economic
downturns (CNN, 2008). The Canadian pharmaceu-
tical firm Biovail even blamed missing its consen-
sus earnings forecasts on a batch of antidepressants
falling off a delivery truck (Wall Street Journal,
2008b). Similarly, positive surprises have been at-
tributed to better-than-expected sales (Lohr, 1998),
new project development (Shwiff, 2008), and im-
proving business conditions overseas (Wall Street
Journal, 2008a).

Earnings surprises also differ in the extent to
which they deviate from consensus forecasts.
Larger deviations—typically those representing
more than a few cents or a significant percentage
(Doyle, Lundholm, & Soliman, 2006; Jin, 2006;
Kasznik & Lev, 1995; Kinney, Burgstahler, & Mar-

tin, 2002; Livnat & Mendenhall, 2006)—are consid-
ered “material” and are more consequential for
both firms and investors (Barron, Byard, & Young,
2008; Brown, 2001; Jin, 2006; Mikhail, Walther, &
Willis, 2004). Material earnings surprises, both pos-
itive and negative, can have adverse effects on how
a firm is perceived (Ajinkya & Gift, 1984; Skinner,
1994). For example, material earnings surprises
have been associated with reduced analyst cover-
age and stock ownership for a firm (Barron et al.,
2008; Mikhail et al., 2004; Skinner, 1994; Williams,
1996), sharp increases in its cost of capital (Mikhail
et al., 2004), and more vigorous trading in its stock,
indicating that investors are reevaluating their per-
ceptions of the firm (Jin, 2006; Mikhail et al., 2004).
Material earnings surprises, given their rarer occur-
rence and greater salience, therefore have greater
potential than smaller surprises to engage investors
in active sensemaking and reevaluation of a firm
(Barron et al., 2008; Jin, 2006; Williams, 1996).

In the next section we discuss how reputation
and celebrity are gained in order to develop the
theoretical foundation for our hypotheses predict-
ing their effects on firms’ propensities to announce
surprises and on investors’ reactions to these
surprises.

Gaining Reputation and Celebrity

Reputation and celebrity defined. Reputation
research has been conducted from a variety of the-
oretical perspectives, which has led to different
definitions of the construct based on different types
of perceptions. In a recent review of reputation
research, Rindova and colleagues (2005) concluded
that scholars studying reputation from an economic
perspective use the term to refer to perceptions
about a particular attribute, such as the ability to
deliver quality products.
In contrast, scholars
studying reputation from a sociological perspective
use the term to refer to the general public knowl-
edge about and recognition of a firm in relation to a
variety of attributes and stakeholder audiences.
Further, Rindova and colleagues (2005) found that
perceived quality did not affect a firm’s perfor-
mance outcomes directly but was mediated by the
firm’s public recognition. This review suggested
that a firm’s reputation may be best understood as
an intangible asset based on broad public recogni-
tion of the high quality of its capabilities and out-
puts (Deephouse, 2000; King & Whetten, 2008;
Rindova et al., 2005). This is the definition we
adopt in this study, as it also reflects most empiri-
cal management research, which has operation-
alized reputation using various rankings that cap-
ture the recognition that a set of firms have received

in a given organizational field on a variety of at-
tributes (e.g., Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Fryxell &
Wang, 1994; Love & Kraatz, 2009).

In contrast to firm reputation, the concept of firm
celebrity has been developed recently to capture
the “high level of public attention” combined with
“positive emotional responses from stakeholder au-
diences” (Rindova et al., 2006: 51) that some firms
generate. According to Rindova and colleagues
(2006), the combination of visibility and emotional
resonance gives celebrity its distinctive properties
and effects.

Given these definitions, several clarifications
about the distinctions between the two assets are
important. First, whereas visibility is considered
a component of a number of social approval as-
sets (e.g., reputation [Fombrun, 1996], celebrity
[Rindova et al., 2006], and legitimacy [Pollock &
Rindova, 2003]), by itself it is not sufficient to de-
fine either reputation or celebrity. Second, al-
though reputation may also evoke some positive
stakeholder affect (Fombrun, 1996), the social ap-
proval associated with reputation is derived to a
large extent from the collective recognition of a
firm’s demonstrated ability to create value (see
Rindova et al. [2005] for a review). In contrast, the
social approval associated with celebrity arises
largely from emotional resonance—that is, the ex-
citement and engagement that some firms evoke
(Rindova et al., 2006). We discuss the theoretical
importance of these distinctions next.

How reputation and celebrity are gained. A
core argument we advance in this article is that the
different types of social approval associated with a
high level of reputation (high reputation) and ce-
lebrity reflect differences in the processes through
which they are built. Prior research has suggested
that firms develop high reputation by exhibiting
consistent behaviors that result in outcomes recog-
nized and valued by stakeholder audiences (Bar-
nett et al., 2006; Fombrun, 1996; Gardberg & Fom-
brun, 2006). Examples of high-reputation firms in
our sample include Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson &
Johnson, and 3M—firms widely recognized for
their consistency in delivering valued outcomes.
The public knowledge and recognition of the abil-
ity to deliver value consistently can reduce uncer-
tainty even for stakeholders who lack direct expe-
rience with a firm, thereby resulting in greater
stakeholder willingness to exchange resources with
high-reputation firms.

In contrast to reputation, firm celebrity is created
when the media cast firms as protagonists in dra-
matic narratives that are developed to explain the
causes of complex and uncertain outcomes and
events (Rindova et al., 2006). Firms that take non-

conforming actions lying outside the range of be-
haviors typical in their industries are likely to be
chosen as protagonists for these narratives. Further,
the media combine descriptions of these actions with
vivid information about these companies’ cultures,
identities, and leadership and endow them with a
(generally) positive affective quality (Zajonc, 1980)
that meets audiences’ “need for gossip, fantasy, iden-
tification,
and attachment”
(Rindova et al., 2006: 51). Examples of celebrity firms
in our sample include Amazon.com, Oracle, and
Charles Schwab. These companies’ unconvention-
al—and at
times controversial—actions have at-
tracted media attention touting their distinctive cul-
tures, charismatic leaders, and singular identities.

affiliation,

status,

Reputation, celebrity, and earnings surprises.
Extending the preceding arguments about the dif-
ferences in the behaviors and outcomes through
which reputation and celebrity are gained leads us
to expect possession of these assets to be associated
with different propensities to surprise the market.
Specifically, because reputations are built through
consistent behaviors that produce valued out-
comes, high-reputation firms are likely to possess
underlying capabilities that generate consistent
and predictable patterns of behavior and perfor-
mance. They also have incentives to exert addi-
tional effort to maintain predictability and reliabil-
ity, as these attributes are central to maintaining
high levels of reputation (Fombrun, 1996).

For celebrity firms, we expect the opposite: They
are more likely to announce material earnings sur-
prises than noncelebrity firms because celebrity ac-
crues from taking risky, nonconforming actions
that result in harder-to-predict outcomes. Though
such actions may enable celebrity firms to “strike it
big” from time to time, they may also lead them to
“strike out” more frequently (Sanders & Hambrick,
2007). Further, according to Rindova and col-
leagues (2006), celebrity firms experience pressure
to maintain their celebrity and therefore have in-
centives to take more extreme nonconforming ac-
tions over time.

In sum, both the underlying capabilities and in-
centives of high-reputation firms are less likely to
lead them to announce earnings surprises than
firms that do not possess this asset; and both the
actions and incentives of celebrity firms are more
likely to lead them to announce earnings surprises,
as they may experience larger and more unpredict-
able swings in performance. Stated more formally:

Hypothesis 1a. Firms with high reputation are
less likely to generate positive material earn-
ings surprises than firms that do not possess
this asset.

Hypothesis 1b. Firms with high reputation are
less likely to generate negative material earn-
ings surprises than firms that do not possess
this asset.

Hypothesis 2a. Firms with celebrity are more
likely to generate positive material earnings sur-
prises than firms that do not possess this asset.

Hypothesis 2b. Firms with celebrity are more
likely to generate negative material earnings sur-
prises than firms that do not possess this asset.

Reputation, Celebrity, and Investors’ Reactions to
Earnings Surprises

As a consequence of the different firm behaviors
through which reputation and celebrity are gained,
stakeholders are likely to expect different kinds of
outcomes from firms possessing one asset or the
other. First, whereas both assets are likely to be
associated with positive expectations about future
performance, these expectations are likely to exist
for different reasons. In the case of high-reputation
firms, expectations about future performance de-
rive from their consistent track records of deliver-
ing quality and value. In the case of celebrity firms,
expectations are likely to be based on their per-
ceived potential to deliver high performance in the
future, rather than on a history of actually doing so
(Rindova et al., 2006).

Second, these assets are not only associated with
different expectations about firm behavior and out-
comes, but also differ in their sociocognitive bases.
As discussed, reputation reflects collective recog-
nition of a firm’s demonstrated ability to deliver
quality and value (Fombrun, 1996; Rindova & Fom-
brun, 1999). As such, it serves as a relatively ration-
al, analytical interpretive frame through which
stakeholders can assess the likelihood that the firm
will continue to exhibit the valued attributes or
behaviors in the future. In contrast, celebrity is
based on a combination of collective salience and
emotional resonance evoked by dramatic narratives
about unconventional actions and attributes. As
such, celebrity is derived from, and stimulates,
more affective information processing (Slovic,
Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2004).1

1 It is important to note that analytical and affective
information processing are not mutually exclusive and
can be employed at the same time, although, in a given
set of circumstances, one mode tends to dominate (Slovic
et al., 2004). Therefore, our arguments should be inter-
preted in terms of reputation and celebrity evoking a
dominant information processing mode.


2010

Pfarrer, Pollock, and Rindova

Research on information processing supports
this distinction, as it demonstrates that people us-
ing analytical and affective modes of information
processing rely on different information inputs,
combine them in different ways, and ultimately
arrive at different assessments and attitudes
(Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989; also see Slovic
et al. [2004] for a review). For example, whereas
analytical information processing is conscious, de-
liberate, and based on logic, evidence, and causal
reasoning, affective information processing is rapid
and holistic (Agarwal & Malhotra, 2005; Slovic et
al., 2004). Whereas these different information pro-
cessing modes have been theorized primarily at the
individual level of analysis, we argue that they can
be used to characterize stakeholder sensemaking
using reputation and celebrity as two different
types of interpretative frames. We discuss their ef-
fects next. Since it is well established that positive
and negative information stimuli are processed dif-
ferently (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Willemsen & Keren,
2002), we discuss their effects on investors’ reac-
tions to positive and negative earnings surprises
separately.

Investors’ reactions to positive earnings sur-
prises. Both reputation and celebrity provide inter-
pretive frames associated with positive expecta-
tions about a firm’s future performance (albeit for
different reasons). Research on the psychology of
expectancy violations tells us that a violation that
exceeds prior expectations tends to result in greater
satisfaction with the outcome (Brown, Venkatesh,
Kuruzovich, & Massey, 2008; Burgoon & Hale,
1988; Wanous, Poland, Premack, & Davis, 1992)
and that positive prior expectations heighten this
effect (Burgoon & Lapoire, 1993). Building on these
ideas, we argue that, as positive interpretative
frames associated with positive expectations, both
reputation and celebrity can enhance investors’ re-
actions to the positive earnings surprises of firms
that possess these assets.

However, because reputation and celebrity re-
flect different types of social approval derived from
different perceptions and expectations, their effects
on investors’ reactions are likely to differ. Firms
earn high reputations through consistency in deliv-
ering valued outcomes. As a result, investors are
likely to expect not only positive, but also predict-
able, outcomes from high-reputation firms. A ma-
terial positive earnings surprise generated by a
high-reputation firm therefore conveys both posi-
tive and negative information—the firm has per-
formed well, but it has also behaved inconsistently.
In contrast, some degree of unpredictability is ex-
pected from celebrity firms (Rindova et al., 2006),
from which investors may not only tolerate, but

even anticipate, variable outcomes. Therefore, for
celebrity firms a material positive earnings surprise
is likely to be seen as strictly positive information.
Further, a positive earnings surprise is an affec-
tively positive stimulus whose effect is likely to be
accentuated by the positive holistic affective frame
associated with celebrity (Agarwal & Malhotra,
2005; Slovic et al., 2004). As a result, the positive
earnings surprises of celebrity firms should elicit
the strongest positive reactions from investors.

In sum, we propose that whereas both reputation
and celebrity are likely to have a positive effect on
investors’ reactions to positive earnings surprises,
the effect will be stronger for celebrity firms. This is
because for celebrity firms some degree of expected
unpredictability and a positive holistic affective
frame converge to strengthen the positive surprise
effect; in contrast, for high-reputation firms, unmet
expectations of predictability are likely to weaken
the effect. Taken together, the above arguments
lead us to hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 3a. High-reputation firms experi-
ence more positive investor reactions to their
material positive earnings surprises than firms
that do not possess either high reputation or
celebrity.

Hypothesis 3b. Celebrity firms experience more
positive investor reactions to their material
positive earnings surprises than firms that do
not possess either celebrity or high reputation.

Hypothesis 3c. Celebrity firms experience more
positive investor reactions to their material
positive earnings surprises than high-reputa-
tion firms.

Investors’ reactions to negative earnings sur-
prises. It is hardly surprising to argue that investors
react positively to positive surprises and negatively
to negative surprises. What is surprising is the asym-
metry in human responses to positive and negative
events. Psychological research has amassed a vast
body of evidence that individuals are subject to a
pervasive “negativity bias,” defined as the ten-
dency to experience negative events as more salient
and diagnostic than positive events, to give them
more weight in judgments and assessments, and to
respond to them more strongly (Hastie & Dawes,
2001; see Rozin and Royzman [2001] for a review).
In keeping with this work, in our context investors’
negative reactions to negative earnings surprises
have been found to be more extreme than their
positive reactions to positive earnings surprises of
similar magnitude (e.g., Brown, 2001; Kasznik &
Lev, 1995; Skinner & Sloan, 2002).

Whereas these general effects of positive and neg-


1136

ative surprises are well understood, how they may
be influenced by firm-specific interpretive frames
such as reputation and celebrity has not been stud-
ied. In fact, plausible speculations can be advanced
that high reputation and celebrity either exacerbate
or attenuate investors’ negative responses to nega-
tive surprises. We base our predictions on our core
theoretical arguments that: (1) reputation and ce-
lebrity are interpretative frames associated with
positive expectations and (2) these frames differ in
the type of social approval and the related informa-
tion processing modes they stimulate. We predict
that high-reputation and celebrity firms will expe-
rience less negative responses to negative surprises
than firms that do not possess these assets, and that
high-reputation firms will experience less negative
responses than celebrity firms.

Recall that reputation engenders positive expec-
tations about performance because it reflects the
collective recognition of a firm’s ability to perform
and create value. Taking their cues from Heider
(1958) and Kelley (1973), psychologists have ar-
gued that beliefs about ability to perform are built
by positive information (i.e., past successes) and
that they are relatively resilient to negative infor-
mation that contradicts them (i.e., a current “fail-
ure”). This is because failure can be attributed to
many causes, but ability can be demonstrated only
through successful performance (Skowronski &
Carlston, 1987, 1989). As a result, negative infor-
mation is less diagnostic for forming and changing
impressions about ability. Furthermore, the more
“proven” the perception of ability is in observers’
minds (as may be the case for high-reputation
firms), the less diagnostic negative information is
likely to be. For example, in keeping with this
argument, Heath and Tversky (1991) found that
experts experienced less negative evaluations than
novices for making the same mistakes in predicting
outcomes. Extending these ideas to the organiza-
tional level, we propose that high reputations pro-
vide positive analytical frames about firms’ demon-
strated ability to deliver value. As such,
they
reduce the “diagnosticity” of negative earnings sur-
prises, leading investors to give them lesser weight
than they would absent the high-reputation frame
about organizational ability.

In the case of celebrity, the picture is more am-
biguous. On the one hand, an actor’s celebrity is not
associated with a record of demonstrated ability,
but with the actor’s perceived potential. As a result,
negative information may not be discarded; in fact,
it could be seen as a signal that the perceived po-
tential may not be realized. On the other hand, the
affective basis of celebrity may increase the likeli-
hood that discrepant information is ignored (Ari-

ely, 2008; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Seo, Goldfarb, &
Barrett, 2010) or evaluated differently (Slovic,
MacGregor, Malmfors, & Purchase, 1997). For ex-
ample, Slovic and colleagues (1997) found that af-
fect mediated how toxicologists rated the risk asso-
ciated with being exposed to small amounts of
different chemicals. Although the risk in all in-
stances was essentially the same, positive affect
toward a chemical significantly reduced the toxi-
cologists’ ratings of the risks, and negative affect
increased their ratings of the risk. In another in-
triguing study, Hsee and Kunreuther (2000) found
that positive affect made individuals willing to pay
twice as much to insure the shipment of a beloved,
albeit nonfunctioning, antique clock as they would
pay to ship a similar clock about which they were
affectively neutral. Further, holding the amount of
compensation fixed, individuals were willing to
expend more effort to obtain compensation for
damage to a positive affect–laden object. Finally, in
the context of investing behavior, Seo and col-
leagues (2010) found that positive affect attenuated
and, in some cases, even reversed the effects of
prior gains and losses on subsequent risk taking by
members of investing clubs. Taken together, these
findings suggest positive affect is motivating in
judgment and action and therefore lead us to expect
that firms with celebrity will experience less nega-
tive consequences of their negative surprises than
firms that do not possess this intangible asset.

With regard to the relative effects of reputation
and celebrity on investors’ responses to negative
surprises, different expectations again appear plau-
sible. First, to the degree that high-reputation firms
are expected to behave consistently and celebrity
firms are expected to be nonconformists, one could
argue that investors will be affected by reputation
and celebrity in the same way as predicted for
positive surprises (i.e., they will react less nega-
tively to surprises generated by celebrity firms than
to those of high-reputation firms). However, as dis-
cussed earlier, negative information is more likely
to be disregarded when a positive, ability-related
frame exists (as in the case of high-reputation
firms). Further, the holistic information processing
stimulated by celebrity’s affective frame may com-
pete with the analytical information processing
triggered by negative information (Baumeister,
Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001). The com-
peting information processing tendencies of the
positive interpretative frame and the negative stim-
ulus may weaken the overall effect of celebrity.
Therefore, psychological research provides evi-
dence to support the argument that high reputation
is a stronger buffer in the case of negative events
than celebrity is. We therefore hypothesize that:

not possess either celebrity or high reputation.

Hypothesis 4c. High-reputation firms experi-
ence less negative investor reactions to their
material negative earnings surprises than ce-
lebrity firms.

DATA AND METHODS

Sample

We tested our hypotheses using matched-sample
data on 291 firms observed between 1991 and 2005.
To construct the sample, we first identified 80
high-reputation firms that appeared in the top 25 of
either the Fortune “Most Admired Companies” list
or in the Wall Street Journal/Harris Interactive
ranking during our period of study. We then
matched each high-reputation firm with three firms
from the same four-digit SIC code that were similar
in assets, revenues, and return on assets (ROA)
(Combs & Skill, 2003; Porac, Wade, & Pollock,
1999). Where appropriate matches were not found
at the four-digit level, we looked at three-digit and
two-digit SIC codes for similar firms (Combs &
Skill, 2003). Through this process we identified
129 matching firms at the four-digit level, 32 at the
three-digit level, and 50 at the two-digit level. For
29 firms we were able to identify only 2 firms each
with the requisite matching attributes. A t-test com-
paring differences in firm size (total assets) re-
vealed no significant differences between the 80
high-reputation and 211 matched companies (t ⫽
⫺0.35, n.s.); however, in keeping with the predic-
tions of prior reputation research (Roberts & Dowl-
ing, 2002), there were significant differences in rev-
enues and ROA ($35.1 vs. $16.8 billion, p ⬍ .001;
and 8.97 percent vs. 4.28 percent, p ⬍ .001, respec-
tively). Availability of analysts’ estimates for each
year from Thomson Financial’s I/B/E/S database
reduced the 4,365 firm-year full sample to 3,107
firm-year observations. T-tests comparing the full
and reduced samples showed that the firms with
earnings data available had significantly more total
assets ($54.1 vs. $46.8 billion, p ⬍ .05), greater sales
($18.7 vs. $15.11 billion, p ⬍ .0001), and higher
ROA (5.52 percent vs. 2.15 percent, p ⬍ .001) than
firms with missing earnings data. These character-

istics suggested our sample provided a conserva-
tive test of our hypotheses since they result in some
restriction of
range
and
well-performing firms.

Dependent Variables

Material earnings surprises. To capture mate-
rial earnings surprises, we created a year-end con-
sensus estimate based on the mean of analysts’ last
forecasts of firms’ annual earnings (cf. Doyle et al.,
2006; Livnat & Mendenhall, 2006) and calculated
the percentage difference between this mean esti-
mate and firms’ reported earnings (Kinney et al.,
2002; Matsunaga & Park, 2001). For example, if a
firm reported actual earnings of $1.10, and the an-
alysts’ final consensus estimate was $1.00, then the
firm would have generated a positive surprise of 10
percent. Conversely, if the firm had reported $1.00
against an estimate of $1.10, it would have gener-
ated a negative surprise of 9 percent.

There is no one standard method for operation-
alizing material earnings surprises. Finance and
accounting scholars who study surprises have rou-
tinely used different dollar amounts, percentages,
and percentile cutoffs to delineate them (e.g., Bar-
ber & Griffin, 1994; Barron et al., 2008; Doyle et al.,
2006; Jin, 2006; Kinney et al., 2002; Livnat & Men-
denhall, 2006; Skinner, 1994; Skinner & Sloan,
2002). To avoid scaling by price alone (Easton,
2004) or employing arbitrary cutoff values having
different meanings in different years and different
industry segments (Skinner & Sloan, 2002), we fol-
lowed past research identifying material earnings
surprises on the basis of percentiles (e.g., Barber &
Griffin, 1994; Doyle et al., 2006; Jin, 2006, Kinney
et al., 2002; Livnat & Mendenhall, 2006) and de-
fined material earnings surprises as the top and
bottom quartiles of positive and negative surprises
in a given industry in a given year. This approach
controlled for differences in volatility and perfor-
mance expectations among the industries in our
sample over the 15-year period. We identified top-
and bottom-quartile surprises in each of the 30
industry groups represented in our final sample
defined using two-digit SIC codes. To calculate the
top and bottom quartiles, we used the initial uni-
verse of 2,417 firms in Compustat that were in these
industry segments and for which earnings esti-
mates were available (generating 20,357 firm-year
observations), and not simply the 291 firms in the
matched sample. The median number of analysts
covering firms in the full sample used to identify
material surprises was 5. In our final sample of
3,107 observations, the number of analysts cover-
ing firms ranged from 1 to 47, with a median of 15.

The final sample included 770 material positive
surprises, 754 material negative surprises, 323 ob-
servations in which firms met earnings exactly, and
1,260 observations in which firms missed earnings
by less than a material amount.2 To ensure that our
definition of material surprises did not drive re-
sults, in analyses not reported here we also tested
definitions based on top and bottom percentile cut-
offs of 20, 30, and 40 percent (cf. Barber & Griffin,
1994; Livnat & Mendenhall, 2006), as well as all
surprises that were greater than 1 percent of ex-
pected earnings (cf. Kasznik & Lev, 1995; Mikhail et
al., 2004). The results were substantively the same
as those reported here.

In the tests of Hypotheses 1 and 2, the dependent
variable positive surprise was a dummy coded 1 if
a firm experienced a positive material earnings sur-
prise, and the dependent variable negative surprise
was a dummy coded 1 if a firm experienced a
material negative earnings surprise. Given the lon-
gitudinal, repeated-measures design of the study,
firms could (1) surprise more than once and (2)
generate either positive or negative surprises, or
both types.

Cumulative abnormal adjusted return. To test
Hypotheses 3a–3c and 4a– 4c, our dependent vari-
able was a firm’s cumulative abnormal adjusted
return (CAR) over the three-day (⫺1, ⫹1) window
surrounding the earnings surprise announcement.
Previous organizational research has shown that a
three-day window is appropriate for measuring un-
expected events such as earnings surprises as it
allows capture of information leakage prior to the
event and slow responses on the day after the event
(Arthur, 2003; Benbunan-Fich & Fich, 2004; Mc-
Williams & Siegel, 1997; Zhang & Wiersema, 2009).
CARs were the sum of abnormal adjusted returns
(ARs) generated using the following regression
equation (Combs & Skill, 2003):

Rit ⫽ ␣j ⫹ ␤iRmt ⫹ ␧it,

where Rit is the return for security j on day t, Rmt is
the market return for the designated market (in our

case, the CRSP value-weighted index),3 ␤is the beta
of stock j, ␣ is the intercept, and ␧ is the error term
over estimation period t. Subsequently, a firm’s
daily abnormal adjusted return is calculated as:

ARit ⫽ Rit ⫺ (ai ⫹ biRmt),

where a and b are ordinary least squares (OLS)
parameter estimates generated from the regression.
Thus, CARs are cumulative daily ARs over a se-
lected window.

The CARs were calculated using EVENTUS, a
program provided by Wharton Research Data Ser-
vices (WRDS). The regression equation described
above was estimated over a period between 255 and
46 trading days prior to the earnings announcement
date (Wade, Porac, Pollock, & Graffin, 2006). In
addition, we utilized the “autodate-yes” command
in WRDS: If a given date occurred on a nontrading
day (e.g., Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), the first
subsequent business day was utilized.

Independent Variables

Because one of the goals of our study was to
compare the effects of reputation and celebrity un-
der different conditions, we followed prior re-
search suggesting that the construction of “ideal
types” based on actors’ possessing the highest lev-
els of relevant characteristics was both theoreti-
cally and empirically useful for representing the
distinctiveness of individual constructs (Rao, Davis,
& Greve, 2001; Svensson, 2009; Thornton & Ocasio,
1999; Weber, 1922/1978). We thus identified high-
reputation and celebrity firms as those that pos-
sessed the highest levels of these assets. This ap-
proach is also consistent with reputation and
celebrity theory, in that the value of these assets is
related to their level of accumulation (Dierickx &
Cool, 1989; Rao, 1994; Rindova et al., 2006). Fi-
nally, social psychology research suggests that
discrimination is meaningful at the tops and bot-
toms of rankings, but not in the middle ranges
(Burson & Larrick, 2009; Janicik & Larrick, 2005).
This research provides evidence that continuous

2 Seventy-five percent of firms were covered by at least
8 analysts, and 90 percent by at least 3. Using the average
of multiple analysts’ estimates limit the biases associated
with any one analyst’s forecast (Clarke, Khorana, Patel, &
Rau, 2007; Hirsch & Pozner, 2005; Stickel, 1992). The
median positive surprise when a firm missed earnings
estimates by any amount was 2.2 percent; for material
positive surprises, the median was 7.2 percent. For neg-
ative surprises, the median value when earnings were
missed by any amount was –3.2 percent; for material
negative surprises, the median was –5.4 percent.

3 Following robustness checks employed in similar
event studies (cf. Arthur, 2003; Combs & Skill, 2003;
Wade et al., 2006), we also measured the CARs against
two other market proxies—the CRSP equal-weighted in-
dex and the S&P 500—as well as excess returns. The
results remained the same in all cases. In addition, we
also calculated CARs in the days immediately preceding
(–1, 0) and following (0, ⫹1) the earnings announcement,
as well as over 7-day (–3 to ⫹3) and 11-day (–5 to ⫹5)
windows. The substantive results did not change.

rankings may tend to create artificial differences
where no differences actually exist (Rao, 1994),
thereby introducing additional error into a mea-
sure. These considerations suggest that operation-
alizing high levels of reputation and celebrity with
dichotomous variables enabled us to clearly distin-
guish firms possessing each type of asset.

High reputation. Following past research, we ob-
tained data on a firm’s reputation using the rank-
ings in Fortune’s “Most Admired Companies” (e.g.,
Basdeo, Smith, Grimm, Rindova & Derfus, 2006;
Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Love & Kraatz, 2009;
Roberts & Dowling, 2002), as well as the Wall Street
Journal/Harris Interactive “Corporate Reputation”
list (Gardberg & Fombrun, 2002), and coded a firm
as having a high reputation if it appeared among
the top 25 firms on either list in a given year (1,
“high reputation,” 0 otherwise). We combined in-
formation from the two lists because Fortune only
listed the top 10 firms in an industry between 1997
and 1998, and only the top 20 firms between 1999
and 2005. Of the 25 different firms listed in For-
tune’s top 10/top 20 list between 1999 and 2005, 22
were also named in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ)/
Harris top 25, showing strong overlap between the
two lists and validating our choice to combine the
information from them.4 Our final sample included
357 high-reputation firm-year observations.

Celebrity. Since firm celebrity is defined as a
combination of high levels of public attention and
positive emotional responses from stakeholders,
we used both components in creating our celebrity
measure. We used a firm’s media visibility, opera-
tionalized as the total number of articles published
about the firm each year in BusinessWeek, to cap-
ture the public attention component of celebrity.
These articles were obtained from Lexis-Nexis. We
used BusinessWeek as the media source because it
is a general business publication that tends to pub-
lish feature articles, which are likely to contain the
type of dramatic narratives associated with the con-
struction of celebrity (Madrick, 2001; Rindova et
al., 2006). To ensure our measure captured relevant
media coverage, we generated a search algorithm
within Lexis-Nexis that avoided potential “false
positives,” as well as tables of contents, firm list-
ings, and stock reports. This process generated a
database of 42,657 articles. Firms in the top quartile

4 In analyses not reported here, we reran our models
excluding the years 1997 and 1998 as well as the com-
panies from the WSJ/Harris list. Although sample size
and thus variance were reduced, especially in the latter
case, the results were substantively the same as reported
here.

of media visibility in a given year were coded 1 for
media visibility (0 otherwise). Top-quartile firms
were mentioned, on average, at least eight times per
year, whereas the median firm was mentioned only
two times, and the bottom third of the sample
received no coverage.

We analyzed the the degree of positive and neg-
ative affective language used in each article to cap-
ture the affective component of celebrity. We em-
ployed the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)
program and its dictionary of more than 900 affec-
tive words with positive and negative valence to
code the texts (Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis,
(2007) (see http://www.liwc.net for additional in-
formation on the internal and external validity of
LIWC’s dictionaries). We then created a ratio of
each article’s positive affective content to its total
affective content, because using only the raw posi-
tive affect score could be misleading—an article
may have both high positive and high negative
emotional content, thus creating a more balanced
affective perspective overall (Pollock & Rindova,
2003; Rindova, Petkova, & Kotha, 2007; Tetlock,
Saar-Tsechansky, & Macskassy, 2008). Following
recent research (Pew Research Center, 2008; Tet-
lock et al., 2008), we coded an article as “positive”
if the positive affective content was at least 60
percent of the total affective content, and as nega-
tive if 60 percent or more of the total affective
content was negative. Articles with ratios falling
between these
coded
“neutral.”5

two breakpoints were

To capture overall affective resonance, we used
imbalance,
the Janis-Fadner (JF) coefficient of
which has been used in past research to assess the
evaluative tenor of media coverage (Deephouse,
2000; Janis & Fadner, 1965; Pollock & Rindova,
2003). In this study we applied the JF coefficient to
operationalize the overall affectivity of media cov-
erage. The JF coefficient equals:

(P2 ⫺ PN)/V2 if P ⬎ N; 0 if P ⫽ N; and (PN

⫺ N2)/V2 if N ⬎ P,

where P is the number of positive articles written
about a firm in a given year, N is the number of
negative articles, and V is the total annual article
count. The JF coefficient ranges from ⫺1 to 1, with
⫺1 equal to all negative coverage and 1 equal to all
positive coverage. We converted the JF coefficient
to values ranging from ⫺100 to 100, with 0 desig-

percent/25 percent. The results of our analyses remained

nating neutral coverage. As with the public atten-
tion measure, we then created a dummy variable
that coded firms with JF scores in the top quartile of
positive affective content 1 and others 0. Like pub-
lic attention, positive affective content was skewed.
Top-quartile firms, on average, had JF coefficients
of 70 or better, whereas the JF coefficient for the
median firm was 37.5, and the bottom quartile had
neutral (0) to negative (⫺100) JF coefficients. If a
firm was in the top quartiles for both media visibil-
ity and positive affect in a given year, it was coded
as a celebrity (1; 0). This approach generated 145
celebrity firm-year observations over the 15-year
period. The high-reputation and celebrity variables
appeared to have good discriminant validity, as the
correlation between these two measures was low
(r ⫽ 0.09, p ⬍ .05).

Control Variables

Firm stock. We used the log-transformed values
of the number of shares outstanding and the aver-
age trading volume of a stock (based on Compustat
data) to capture differences between value and
growth stocks, which finance researchers have
found are treated differently by investors when the
firms issuing the stocks report earnings surprises
(Brown, 2001; Skinner & Sloan, 2002).

Number of analysts. The number of analysts
covering a firm’s stock has also been linked by
finance researchers to the likelihood of the firm’s
announcing earnings surprises (Brennan & Hughes,
1991; Chen & Steiner, 2000; MacKinlay, 1997). We
controlled for this effect using the natural log of the
number of analysts covering a firm at the end of
each year (from I/B/E/S data).

Firm history. We used several variables to con-
trol for multiple aspects of a firm’s history that
could affect our relationships of interest: prior
ROA, prior positive surprises, prior negative sur-
prises, prior meeting estimates, prior high reputa-
tion, and prior celebrity. Drawing from organiza-
tional research on learning and contagion (Argote,
Beckman, & Epple, 1990; Darr, Argote, & Epple,
1995; Greve, 2003), we generated a weighted sum
that assigned a weight of 1/n for each year prior to
a focal year for past return on assets6 (to control for
a performance halo effect), prior positive and neg-
ative earnings surprises (to control for “habitual
surprisers”), prior instances of meeting earnings

6 Following prior research (Brown & Perry, 1994; Rob-
erts & Dowling, 2002), we regressed ROA on high repu-
tation and used the residual from this regression in our
models.

estimates exactly (to control for earnings guidance),
and prior high reputation or celebrity (to control for
the historical levels of these assets), with n desig-
nating the number of years prior to the focal year.
We constructed 15-, 10-, 5-, and 3-year summed
variables, utilizing the 1/n “decay” rates for each of
the variables, and obtained the same results for
each alternative. The results reported here reflect
15-year weights.

Firm, year, and industry. Finally, we controlled
for firm size (the natural logs of annual sales and
total assets) and included year and two-digit SIC
industry dummies to control for variance across
economic cycles and industries. We lagged each
control variable to help rule out reverse causality
(Kenny, 1979).

Estimation Procedures

The sample consisted of pooled time series data
with repeated measures, as each firm had up to 15
years of data and could surprise multiple times.
Given that we were primarily concerned with in-
terfirm differences and certain predictor variables
were mostly time-invariant, we obtained, report,
and interpret results using random-effects logistic
regression analysis for the tests of Hypotheses 1a,
1b, 2a, and 2b (Rao, Davis, & Ward, 2000). Random-
effects models control for within-firm variance, al-
lowing for between-firm comparisons (Petersen,
1993) and limiting large losses of observations that
can lead to model convergence problems (Rao et al.,
2000). As a robustness check, however, we also
utilized a generalized estimating equations (GEE)
regression model, a method found suitable for
panel data because it measures both within- and
between-firm variance and generates robust esti-
mates of standard errors (Ballinger, 2004; Wade et
al., 2006). Our results were the same. In testing
Hypotheses 3a–3c and 4a– 4c, we used the event
study methodology (MacKinlay, 1997; McWilliams
& Siegel, 1997) provided by the EVENTUS software
package to generate the CARs and compared the
mean CARs for each category of firms using t-tests.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and a corre-
lation matrix for the variables used in testing our
hypotheses. The means and standard deviations re-
flect values for raw rather than transformed measures.
All variance inflation factors were below five, with an
average of 2.4. Thus, multicollinearity is not a con-
cern (Chatterjee & Price, 1991; Pedhazur, 1997). Ta-

logistic regressions predicting the likelihood of posi-

tive and negative surprises, respectively. Column 1
presents the effects of the control variables, and col-
umn 2 presents the full model including our high-
reputation and celebrity measures. We report odds
ratios to allow easier interpretation of the magnitude
of effects. An odds ratio greater than one indicates the
likelihood that an event will occur increases with a
one-unit increase in the independent variable. An
odds ratio less than one indicates the likelihood that
an event will occur decreases with a one-unit in-
crease in the independent variable.

Hypotheses 1a and 1b predict, respectively, that
high-reputation firms will experience fewer posi-
tive and negative surprises than other firms. For
positive surprises, Table 2 shows that high-reputa-
tion firms had an odds ratio of 0.48 (p ⬍ .01), which
means they were less likely to generate a positive
earnings surprise than firms that did not possess
high reputation. However, Table 3 shows high rep-
utation did not have a significant effect on the
likelihood of negative surprises. Thus, Hypothesis
1a was supported, and Hypothesis 1b was not.

Hypotheses 2a and 2b predict, respectively, that
celebrity firms will be more likely to experience
positive and negative surprises than firms that do
not possess celebrity. For positive surprises, Table
2 shows that celebrity firms had an odds ratio of
1.60 (p ⬍ .05), providing support for Hypothesis 2a.
However, Table 3 shows celebrity did not have a
significant effect on the likelihood of negative
surprises. Hypothesis 2b,
therefore, was not
supported.

Effects of Reputation and Celebrity on Investors’
Reactions to Surprises

Hypotheses 3a–3c and 4a– 4c predict the effects
of firm reputation and celebrity on investors’ reac-
tions to earnings surprises. Initial nonparametric
tests (Patell Z and generalized sign) indicated that
the market viewed positive earnings surprises fa-
vorably (p ⬍ .05) and perceived negative earnings
surprises as “bad news” (p ⬍ .05). This pattern is
consistent with previous studies on investors’ reac-
tions to earnings surprises (e.g., Kasznik & Lev,
1995; Skinner, 1994; Skinner & Sloan, 2002).

Tables 4 and 5 present the size of each subsample
category (“high reputation,” “celebrity,” and “none”),
the mean three-day (⫺1, ⫹1) CARs associated with
positive and negative surprises for the categories
being compared, the pairwise differences between
the mean CARs observed for each category, and the
significance of these differences based on paired
t-tests of unequal variances.

Hypotheses 3a and 3b predict, respectively, that
high-reputation and celebrity firms will enjoy more

positive investor reactions to their positive sur-
prises than firms in the “none” category, and Hy-
pothesis 3c predicts that celebrity firms will garner
more positive responses
than high-reputation
firms. The results in Table 4 support all three hy-
potheses. The CARs for the high-reputation (2.30
percent) and celebrity categories (3.32 percent)
were significantly larger than the CAR for the
“none” category (1.74 percent), and the CAR for
celebrity was significantly larger than the CAR for
high reputation (p ⬍ .05).

Table 5 presents the tests of Hypotheses 4a– 4b,
which predict, respectively, that high-reputation
and celebrity firms will experience less negative
reactions to their negative surprises than firms pos-
sessing neither high reputation nor celebrity, and
Hypothesis 4c, which predicts that high-reputation
firms will experience less negative responses than
celebrity firms. Both high-reputation and celebrity
firms had slightly positive average CARs (0.42 per-
cent and 0.36 percent, respectively), whereas firms
in the “none” category had a significant, negative
mean CAR (⫺0.59 percent). The nonparametric
tests indicated that the CARs for reputation and
celebrity were not significantly different from their
predicted values, but the CARs for firms in the
“none” category were significantly different. The
t-tests showed that the mean CARs for high repu-
tation and celebrity were significantly different
from the “none” category’s mean CAR and that the
CARs for high-reputation and celebrity firms were
not significantly different from one another. Thus,
Hypotheses 4a and 4b were supported, and Hy-
pothesis 4c was not.

Robustness Checks

Because our tests did not allow us to control for
other factors that can affect the size of a CAR, we
ran GEE regressions that predicted the magnitude
of the three-day CARs while controlling for a
variety of other factors (Wade et al., 2006). The
Appendix provides the detailed results. It is im-
portant to note that these regressions do not di-
rectly test Hypotheses 3a–3c and 4a– 4c, which
address the performance of firms with high rep-
utation and those with celebrity relative to each
other and relative to firms that do not possess
these assets. Instead, the regressions examined if
high reputation and celebrity had direct relation-
ships with the magnitude of a firm’s CAR when it
experienced positive and negative earnings sur-
prises. We found that both high reputation (b ⫽ 2.74,
p ⬍ .05) and celebrity (b ⫽ 2.44, p ⬍ .05) had positive,
significant relationships with abnormal returns fol-
lowing a positive earnings surprise, and their inclu-

sion significantly improved the fit of the model. For
negative surprises, high reputation had a marginally
significant positive relationship with abnormal re-
turns (b ⫽ 1.79, p ⬍ .10), celebrity had no significant
relationship, and the inclusion of these variables did
not significantly improve the model’s fit.

We also investigated whether endogeneity due to
unobserved variables might have influenced our
results. Using Bascle’s (2008) criteria to select the
appropriate estimation approach, we employed a
Heckman correction model (Hamilton & Nickerson,
2003; Heckman, 1979). We included predictor vari-
ables in the first-stage models that were signifi-
cantly associated with the likelihood of positive
and negative surprises, but not with the CARs. The
first-stage models were highly significant in pre-
dicting the likelihood of positive and negative sur-
prises, but the selection correction instrument was
not significant when entered into the second-stage

models. Thus, endogeneity did not appear to be a
significant problem in our study (Bascle, 2008;
Mesquita & Brush, 2008; Tong, Reuer, & Peng,
2008).

DISCUSSION

The goal of this study was to contribute to the
large body of organizational and strategy research
on intangible assets by specifying how two distinct
types of social approval assets—reputation and
celebrity—affect firms’ propensities to surprise in-
vestors and investors’ reactions to these surprises.
We developed novel theoretical arguments about
the mechanisms through which the possession of
these assets may affect firm outcomes and investors’
responses and tested the predicted empirical relation-
ships that we based on these theoretical arguments.

Specifically, we examined how the possession of
high levels of reputation and celebrity influenced
the likelihood that firms announced positive and
negative material earnings surprises. We then com-
pared the reactions of investors to these different
types of surprises when they were generated by
firms that had either high reputation or celebrity.
Our findings are consistent with our theoretical
arguments predicting that high-reputation firms are
less likely and celebrity firms are more likely to
announce positive material earnings surprises than
are other firms; however, the possession of these

assets did not affect the propensity for announcing
negative surprises. Second, firms possessing either
high reputation or celebrity experience greater re-
wards for positive surprises and smaller penalties
for negative surprises than firms that do not possess
these assets. Third, the positive returns to celebrity
firms are greater than the positive returns to high-
reputation firms for positive surprises, but there is
no difference in their effects on investor responses
to negative surprises. Taken together, these theoret-
ical ideas and empirical results advance research
on the effects of social approval intangible assets in
several important directions.

Contributions to Research on Intangible Assets

A central contribution of our study is that it is the
first that we are aware of to empirically examine
the differences between firm reputation and celeb-
rity and to operationalize celebrity as defined by
Rindova et al. (2006). Although prior research has
often treated firm celebrity as synonymous with
firm visibility (e.g., Ashforth & Gibbs, 1990; Brooks,
Highhouse, Russell, & Moore, 2003; Sutton & Galu-
nic, 1996), the theory of firm celebrity advanced by
Rindova and her colleagues suggests that celebrity
is a distinct intangible asset based on a combina-
tion of high levels of public attention and positive
affect. Our results support these arguments and
show that the combination of these components
yields a distinct and valuable intangible asset. Fur-
ther, by developing an empirical measure that cap-
tures both components of celebrity, our study pro-
vides a finer-grained analysis of the distinctive
mechanisms through which different social ap-
proval assets affect firm outcomes.

Given the differences we theorized in the nature
of the social approval generated by reputation and
celebrity, as well as the different pattern of effects
observed for each asset in our empirical results, our
study suggests that equating either asset with sim-
ple visibility is problematic. Because visibility has
been identified as a component of both high repu-
tation and celebrity (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990;
Rindova et al., 2006), we explored whether visibil-
ity alone could account for the effects of reputation
and celebrity we report. In analyses not reported
here, we followed the previously described proce-
dures used to construct our celebrity measure and
created a new category for firms that scored in the
top quartile for visibility only each year and com-
pared the mean CARs for firms in this category with
the mean CARs for firms in the high-reputation and
celebrity categories. The mean CAR for high visi-
bility was significantly lower than the CAR for ce-
lebrity for both positive (1.38 percent vs. 3.32 per-

cent) and negative (⫺1.27 vs. 0.36 percent)
surprises. The same pattern was observed for the
difference in CARs between high-visibility and
high-reputation firms: The mean CARs for high-
reputation firms were significantly higher for both
positive (1.38 percent vs. 2.30 percent) and nega-
tive (⫺1.27 percent vs. 0.42 percent) surprises.
These results support our contention that the ef-
fects of reputation and celebrity are distinct from
those of high visibility.

Also, because this is the first empirical operation-
alization of Rindova and colleagues’ (2006) defini-
tion of celebrity, we checked whether the other
component of celebrity—positive affect— could
alone account for the effects of celebrity. In analy-
ses not reported here, we compared the mean CAR
for high-positive-affect only firms with the mean
CAR for celebrity firms. The mean CAR for high
positive affect was significantly lower than the
mean CAR for celebrity (2.09 percent vs. 3.32 per-
cent) for positive surprises, but it was not signifi-
cantly different for negative surprises (0.09 percent
vs. 0.36 percent). These results provide additional
support for the argument that the value of celebrity
is greater than the value of either of its constituent
components and suggest the importance of future
research investigating the specific perceptual com-
ponents of intangible assets.

A second important contribution of our study
lies in providing further evidence for the need to
recognize and understand the role of affect in mar-
kets (e.g., Tetlock et al., 2008; Westphal & Clement,
2008). A particularly intriguing aspect of our find-
ings is that investors react more positively to posi-
tive surprises by celebrity firms than to positive
surprises by high-reputation firms; yet this rela-
tionship is not observed for negative surprises.
These results suggest there are specific conditions
under which affect-based social approval provides
greater benefits and highlight the importance of
future research continuing to explore the affective
processes involved in firm evaluations and system-
atically assessing the strategic benefits and costs of
affect-based evaluations in markets.

A third contribution of our study is that it provides
empirical evidence that different intangible assets
have different effects on firm outcomes in different
contexts and that these effects are consistent with the
theoretical arguments explaining how these assets are
developed and how they influence stakeholder sen-
semaking about firms. These findings have two im-
portant implications for the large body of manage-
ment
the
performance effects of intangible assets. First, they
open up an important direction for future research by
articulating how the differences in the behaviors

research focused on understanding

though which these assets are gained may subse-
quently affect firm outcomes by making certain types
of behaviors more or less likely. Whereas most re-
search on the performance effects of intangible assets
has focused on how they affect the behaviors of other
market actors, our study suggests that future research
needs to address how intangible assets may influence
firm outcomes by affecting the behaviors of the firms
possessing the assets. Second, our study refines prior
research on the effects of intangible assets on the
behavior of other market actors by examining how
these assets influence behaviors for both positive and
negative instances of the same type of outcome. Spe-
cifically, our findings suggest that celebrity appears to
enhance the benefits of good news more than reputa-
tion does, but reputation may provide a marginally
significant buffering effect in the case of negative
surprises. Although our results do not provide clear
statistical support for all of our theoretical argu-
ments—especially those predicting outcomes related
to negative surprises—they point to the importance of
future research continuing to refine understanding of
how different intangible assets affect market actors’
reactions to important firm outcomes under different
conditions.

Indeed, our results suggest that making clear dis-
tinctions in terms of the intangible assets studied
may be critical for reconciling contradictory find-
ings about their effects. For example, whereas some
researchers have found generally positive buffering
effects that reduce the consequences of a negative
event (e.g., Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; Jones,
Jones, & Little, 2000; Schnietz & Epstein, 2005),
others have shown that intangible assets can be a
“double-edged sword” exacerbating the conse-
quences of the negative event (Brooks et al., 2003;
Rhee & Haunschild, 2006; Sutton & Galunic, 1996;
Wade et al., 2006). Comparing our results with
those of Rhee and Haunschild’s (2006) intriguing
study on the liability of a good reputation in the
context of product recalls is instructive in this re-
gard. Whereas their study focused on the effects of
product reputation, ours focuses on firm reputa-
tion. As Hall (1992) showed, managers view prod-
uct and firm reputation as two distinct intangible
assets; and as Rindova and her colleagues (2005)
showed, a firm’s reputation for quality and its gen-
eral prominence have distinct effects on perfor-
mance outcomes. Therefore, we believe that to gain
greater
insights into the mechanisms through
which intangible assets provide competitive advan-
tages, it is important for scholars to develop theory
and research designs that precisely specify and
capture the type of intangible asset studied and the
context within which its effects are investigated.

In support of our last point, we would like to note


1146

that our empirical approach to capturing the affective
aspect of media coverage in more than 42,000 articles
makes a contribution to researchers seeking to study
specific cognitive and emotional aspects of collective
perceptions. Advanced content analysis techniques
like those presented in this article can help bridge the
gap between large-sample archival research, which
may suffer from internal validity issues, and small-
sample research, which allows for the collection of
primary data and in-depth analyses but may suffer
from external validity problems (Duriau, Reger, &
Pfarrer, 2007). Analyzing the emotional content of a
firm’s press releases, media coverage, or stakeholder
blogs can enhance archival research (which has been
criticized for failure to provide insight into cognitive
processes), while maintaining the advantages of using
large samples.

Some of the limitations of our study also provide
opportunities for future research. In this study, we
explored the effects of intangible assets on one spe-
cific unexpected type of event—a material earnings
surprise. Although having the advantage of enabling
us to examine the effects of both positive and negative
outcomes of the same type of event, focusing on a
single event type has the disadvantage that surprises
can result from internal causes as well as from exter-
nal causes beyond a firm’s control. Perceived firm
control, however, may affect how stakeholders make
sense of an event because of the different attributions
they may make. Therefore, future research that com-
pares the effects of reputation and celebrity on re-
sponses to events that vary in the extent to which
they are under the firm’s control will be important.
For example, events that result from more clearly
identifiable internal causes, such as earnings restate-
ments resulting from material accounting errors,
product recalls, and environmental compliance fail-
ures, or illegal actions on the part of management
(Mishina, Block, Dykes, & Pollock, 2010; Pfarrer,
Smith, Bartol, Khanin, & Zhang, 2008) are all excel-
lent contexts for advancing research in the area
further.

We also did not investigate the content of impres-
sion management accounts provided to explain or
justify earnings surprises by either firms or the
media. Such accounts can influence investor sen-
semaking (Elsbach, 2003), and researchers should
seek to understand their effects in future work.
Given that firms and the media are likely to have
different “source credibility” in providing these ac-
counts and that reputation and celebrity may inter-
act with source credibility, future research might
compare the effects of firm- and media-generated
impression management accounts for firms that
possess these assets to varying degrees. Such re-
search could advance understanding of the role of

these intangible assets in the dynamics of market-
level communications.

Further, future studies that focus directly on the
processes that we theorized but were unable to test
directly could advance understanding of the mecha-
nisms through which these intangible assets affect the
outcomes we studied. Although our results are con-
sistent with our theory-based predictions, our data
did not allow us to directly assess the extent to which
reputation and celebrity provide investors with the
type of collective interpretive frames that our theory
suggests. Although we recognize that this “black-box”
approach is relatively common in research using ar-
chival data, we encourage researchers to also employ
experimental or observational methods to develop a
greater understanding of the use of reputation and
celebrity as different interpretative frames.

Finally, our study focused on a specific stakeholder
audience—investors. Doing so allowed us to control
for a variety of factors and was consistent with our
focus on a particular event that would matter to these
stakeholders, but future research should investigate
the relationships we consider as they relate to other
stakeholder groups, such as government actors, regu-
lators, nongovernmental organizations, employees,
and a firm’s customers. Different stakeholder groups
may react differently to different types of events (Pfar-
rer, DeCelles, Smith, & Taylor, 2008), and their inter-
pretations may be affected differently by firm reputa-
tion and celebrity. Researchers could use other
measures of stakeholder reactions to firms’ legal and
illegal outcomes, such as regulatory sanctions, boy-
cotts, turnover, and lawsuits, to establish the effects
of social approval assets with different stakeholder
groups and to contribute to the development of a
more generalizable theory of intangible assets based
on social approval.

Contributions to Practice

Our study also has implications for managers.
Whereas much of the research on intangible assets
has focused on assets that firms “own,” we draw
attention to social approval assets, which managers
may overlook because they are not associated with
clearly established property rights. Yet, as we argued,
these assets reflect different patterns of firm behavior,
and as a result provide stakeholders with different
types of interpretative frames. One implication of our
argument is that when managers engage in a particu-
lar style of strategic action—bold versus steady, for
example—they are not only pursuing a specific
course of action, but are also generating perceptions
that stabilize in different collective interpretative
frames and tend to have more lasting consequences
than managers may envision. Although these ideas

may appear abstract when discussed theoretically,
we provide empirical evidence that the two types of
social approval assets we examined, high reputation
and celebrity, have demonstrably distinct effects on
both firm outcomes and investors’ reactions. This is
an important result from the perspective of managers,
because perceptions are often discounted as either
epiphenomenal or too idiosyncratic to be managed in
market contexts. Our study emphasizes and demon-
strates not only that perceptions do matter, but also
that different types of perceptions have different ef-
fects and that
these effects can be predicted
theoretically.

Our findings are particularly noteworthy in their
implications for understanding the value of the vari-
ous phenomena often grouped together as “stake-
holder perceptions.” For example, our analyses pro-
vide clear evidence that all social approval is not
equal and that different types of social approval may
be more or less valuable in “good times” and in “bad
times.” In addition, in examining visibility (not spe-
cifically the focus of our study), we found that visi-
bility alone may not be a good thing. In contrast to the
old dictum that “there is no such thing as bad pub-
licity,” the results of our study are more consistent
with the view that, absent wide recognition for a
firm’s ability to create value or positive emotional
resonance, visibility may not be beneficial. The im-
portant managerial implication of this distinction is
that if a firm pursues media visibility, it should have
a clear understanding of whether, and how, this vis-
ibility will generate either positive emotional reso-
nance or broad recognition of its ability to create
value. The latter point is important in the light of the
observation that very few firms in our sample enjoyed
high reputation and celebrity simultaneously. Cou-
pled with our results, this observation points to the
importance both of managers understanding the type
of social approval they seek to gain for their firms and
of researchers specifying which intangible asset they
are investigating.
