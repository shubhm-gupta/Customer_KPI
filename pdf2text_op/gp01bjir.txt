Partnership atWork: Mutuality and the
Balance of Advantage
David E. Guest and Riccardo Peccei

Abstract

A framework for the analysis of partnership at work is presented, emphasizing
the principles, practices and outcomes of partnership. A survey using matched
samples of 54 UK management and employee representatives found a link
between partnership principles and practices, between practices and ratings of
employee attitudes and behaviour, between these and estimates of positive
employment relations and quality and productivity, finally between product-
ivity and sales and profitability. The findings support a mutual gains model
but show that the balance of advantage is skewed towards management and
reflects generally low management trust in employee representatives.

1. Introduction

Partnership, it seems, is an idea whose time has come. Indeed, at the turn of
the millennium, it is one of the British Labour government's big ideas,
constantly paraded as a good thing. It is an idea with which almost anyone
can agree, without having any clear idea of what they are agreeing about.
Perhaps because of this, the term is widely applied, so we hear much about
public±private partnerships and about partnerships between the government
and the people. In the area of work, it is offered as an approach to managing
relations between employers and employees. The aim of this paper is to
explore the meaning of partnership at work, identify some of its distinctive
characteristics, and assess its impact. We start by drawing together some of
the strands in the literature which might help us to make sense of this form
of partnership. Building on this analysis, we then explore the definitions of
partnership offered by actors in organizational settings where there has been
some progress towards partnership. We go on to explore the consequences
of partnership for some key partners. Finally, we highlight certain issues and
problems associated with partnership in theory and in practice.

2. Exploring the meaning of partnership

In recent years, the idea of partnership at work has received considerable
public support in the UK from government, employers and the trade unions.
Partnership is a central element in the policy of the Labour government across
several areas of activity, including that of employment. Prime Minister Tony
Blair, for instance, has argued that a key purpose of the Employment
Relations Act, passed by Parliament in 1999, was to promote partnership at
work (Fairness at Work: see DTI 1998). The government has since further
reinforced its concrete support for partnership by setting up a Partnership
Fund to stimulate a diverse range of partnership activities and initiatives.
The TUC and many leading unions have similarly strongly supported the
concept of partnership and have produced a series of policy documents
including, in May 1999, Partners for Progress: New Unionism in the Work-
place (TUC 1999). This is the TUC's clearest attempt to date to present the
case for, as well as some idea about, the key principles of partnership at
work. The CBI, the employers' confederation, has also shown some support
for partnership, even endorsing the 1999 TUC document, but has lately
become more cautious, concerned that, if partnership increases the influence
of trade unions, it should be opposed (CBI 1999). More generally, Ackers
and Payne (1998), in their analysis of the notion of social partnership, argue
that partnership offers trade unions an opportunity both to regain lost ground
and to establish a significant new identity, while Brown (2000) has shown that
the idea of partnership can usefully serve as a broad concept within which to
analyse developments in employment relations at a variety of levels.

Despite the growing interest and attention that the idea of partnership at
work has attracted in recent years, though, its distinctive substance remains
unclear. There is, in fact, no agreed definition or conceptualization of partner-
ship in either the academic or the policy literature. Different writers tend to
adopt different definitions and to emphasize potentially different elements
and dimensions of partnership (Woodworth and Meek 1995; Marchington
1998; Taylor and Ramsey 1998). Moreover, existing conceptualizations fail
to provide a clear picture of the actual practices that characterize partner-
ship systems, and of the specific principles that might underpin them. Either
explicitly or implicitly, though, most approaches to partnership draw upon,
and are rooted in and informed by, one of three broad intellectual traditions
and theoretical perspectives. For ease of presentation, we label these the
pluralist, unitarist and hybrid perspectives or approaches to partnership.
Below we briefly outline these three perspectives as a basis for gaining a
fuller understanding of the potential meaning of partnership and of the
different elements and dimensions it might involve.

The first approach is firmly rooted in a pluralist perspective. It is closely
linked to and draws on debates about employee representation in Europe
that have their roots in concepts of industrial democracy (IDE 1993) and
workers' participation that acknowledge a pluralist perspective (Provis
1997). Within this perspective, there is a clear acknowledgement of differ-

ences of interest between capital and labour. By implication, capital will
wish to restrict the power of labour if a consequence of that power is likely
to be some redistribution of surplus value. Partly in recognition of this,
a legislative framework provides the basis for what is widely described as
co-determination. In its most developed form,
legislation
provides for clearly set out rights of co-determination, consultation and
communication (IDE 1993). On a European-wide level, the clearest exemp-
lification of the pluralist approach is probably to be found in the legislation
on the Social Chapter and on the European Works Council Directive for
companies operating across a number of European countries.

in Germany,

A key feature of the pluralist approach is the use of a representative
system, often though not necessarily involving trade union representatives,
and often involving directly elected representatives (Rogers and Streeck
1995). The emphasis, in other words, is on various forms of indirect par-
ticipation designed, through the use of representatives, to safeguard and
ensure an independent employee voice within the enterprise. This is not to
suggest that direct forms of worker participation, where each employee
takes decisions related to aspects of their work (Strauss 1992), are com-
pletely ignored within a pluralist perspective. As noted by Sisson (1997),
however, it is employers who have generally been more interested in pur-
suing direct participation, often linking it, as we shall see below, to a more
unitarist perspective on partnership. By contrast, the primary focus of the
pluralist approach, as reflected in the main thrust of European legislation
in this area, has been on representative systems, and especially on works
councils, and on the issues that might be or must be discussed within those
systems. In this context, the term `partnership' has already been widely used
in Europe. In Ireland, for example, Partnership 2000 (Irish Government
1996), a national agreement between government, employers and trade
unions, operated successfully for several years and has been replaced by a
new partnership agreement. Furthermore, the European Union has long
endorsed the concept of social partnership, and in the Commission's DG5
Green Paper on Partnership for a New Organisation of Work (European
Commission 1997) partnership is presented as an end in itself, rather than as
a means to an end.

The second approach to partnership has its roots in a unitarist framework
that explicitly seeks to integrate employer and employee interests, while at
the same time maximizing employee involvement in and commitment to the
organization. Different strands can be distinguished within the unitarist
perspective, depending on the specific policies and practices that are empha-
sized as part of the approach to partnership. One prominent strand, for
instance, focuses on financial incentives and shared ownership as the main
mechanisms for aligning and integrating employer and employee interests
within the enterprise. Within this tradition, the emphasis is primarily on the
use of various forms of profit-sharing and share ownership designed to give
each employee an opportunity to acquire a financial stake in the company
(Blinder 1990; Conte and Svejnar 1990).

A second strand, in contrast, focuses primarily on various forms of direct
employee participation and involvement in day-to-day work activities. This
approach places much more emphasis on individual employee contribution
and is based on the assumption that employee interests are best met by
providing them with scope to take decisions concerning issues about which
they are most expert, namely those related to their day-to-day work. How-
ever, the range of topics dealt with through direct participation is typically
restricted to the job rather than to wider employment issues (Strauss 1998).
Within this perspective, employers often tend to permit greater autonomy
only as long as it maximizes the workers' contribution and is complemented
by communication programmes designed to increase employee commitment
to the organizations' goals and values (Ackers et al. 1992; Heller 1998). As a
result, this approach can, in practice, signal and reflect a relatively low level
of trust; if it is partnership, it therefore runs the risk of being a rather one-
sided form of partnership.

A related, but much broader and more elaborate, unitarist approach is one
that has been most clearly and fully articulated in some of the recent main-
stream American organizational behaviour and human resource manage-
ment literature. This strand focuses on maximizing what might be termed
individual employees' psychic stake in the organization, as reflected in their
overall level of attachment, commitment and involvement in the organiz-
ation and, therefore, to its goals and values and to its success in pursuing
these. Central to this approach is an emphasis on the systematic use of a
full range of what have variously been referred to as progressive, high-
performance, or high-involvement human resource practices in the areas
of selection, training, job design, communications, appraisals, rewards and
so on, all designed to maximize individual±organizational linkages and to
generate high levels of satisfaction, commitment and loyalty among the
work-force (Mowday et al. 1982; Beer et al. 1985; Walton 1985; Lincoln and
Kalleberg 1990; Meyer and Allen 1997; Pfeffer 1998).

The third and last major perspective on partnership is a hybrid one that
combines elements of the two previous perspectives. The hybrid approach is
based on pluralist assumptions and recognizes the importance of represen-
tative systems. At the same time, it also recognizes the importance of direct
forms of employee involvement and participation, as well as the benefits of
management and employees working together to ensure gains for all the
parties concerned. Within a more traditional industrial relations framework,
this hybrid approach is probably best exemplified by the mutual gains model
of writers such as Kochan and Osterman (1994), where employees, both
individually and through representatives, work with management to provide
shared benefits such as job security and increased flexibility and produc-
tivity. Central to the mutual gains model, and to the hybrid approach more
generally, is the idea that, if employee involvement initiatives are to thrive in
the longer term and progressive human resource practices are to be fully
effective, they require the support of a formal joint governance system
(Cutcher-Gershenfeld et al. 1991; Applebaum and Batt 1994). Implicit in

this perspective, therefore,
is the belief that formalized representative
arrangements are necessary both to sustain key elements and processes of
partnership and (perhaps) to prevent exploitation by management.

The assumptions underlying the hybrid mutual gains approach have been
central to much of the UK's public policy debate on partnership at work, a
debate that also reflects important elements of the dominant pluralist and
unitarist perspectives outlined above. Thus, while successive Conservative
governments enthusiastically supported an individualist and market-based
ideology, membership of the European Union required them to make a
grudging accommodation to some elements of the European model, more
especially with respect to the European Works Council Directive. In this
context, an initial endorsement of partnership from the previous Con-
servative government, through a DTI/DfEE document Competitiveness
through Partnerships with People (DTI/DfEE 1997), reveals how the concept
can be presented within a unitarist context. The document discusses shared
goals, culture, learning, effort and information. The emphasis is on sharing
and involvement, and although a role for the unions is acknowledged, it is a
very secondary role. The Labour government has reinvigorated the debate
with its emphasis on the concepts of partnership and fairness. Although the
language may be slightly different, its version of partnership appears to be
similar in many respects to the mutual gains approach outlined above.

The most systematic attempts to define partnership in a UK context have
probably come from the Involvement and Participation Association (IPA)
and the TUC. According to the IPA, the leading UK pressure group for the
adoption of this approach, `the four key building blocks of the partnership
principle are (a) security and flexibility, (b) sharing financial success, (c) devel-
oping good communication and consultation, and (d) representative and
employee voice' (IPA 1997: 4). The TUC (1999) lists six principles that are
very similar: (a) employment security, (b) commitment to the success of the
enterprise, (c) openness and transparency, (d) recognition that partners have
overlapping but distinct interests, (e) enhancing quality of working life and
(f) tapping the motivation, commitment and innovation of employees to
make work more interesting and to add value to the firm. Although these
delineations of principles provide some useful focus, they leave uncertain the
precise content of partnership and the practices that must be in place for an
organization to be described as a partnership organization. Additional analysis
is therefore required of the relationship between principles and practice.

In our analysis so far we have identified a number of potential influences
and perspectives on partnership at work. These include a representative
participation perspective built around legislation and grounded in a pluralist
tradition, a unitarist financial stake, a direct participation and a psychic
stake approach, and a hybrid mutual gains model. These approaches and
perspectives are familiar to any student of industrial relations and human
resource management. In one sense, therefore, partnership is simply a way
of re-focusing old debates. But at the same time, it can be argued that it
offers something distinctive. In particular, if we build on the traditional idea

of the professional partnership, a key issue is that of trust and the basis for
trust, an issue explored within an industrial relations perspective in the
seminal work of Fox (1974). A second key concept and recurring theme is
mutuality, the idea of focusing on the shared interests and shared goals of
two or more interdependent parties while recognizing that they have other
potentially differing interests. More generally, while recognizing that the
preferred view of partnership of employers and employees might differ in
emphasis, we would argue that the key notion underlying partnership is
some idea of working effectively together to achieve shared or comple-
mentary goals. But this raises the question of the sort of institutional
arrangements and the sort of policies and practices that are likely to
promote this to the mutual benefit of the key partners.

By their very nature, the different approaches to partnership reviewed
above can, at best, provide only a partial answer to this question. They do,
however, direct attention to specific practices and arrangements that might
be important in this respect. Building on these approaches, therefore, we
now present an empirically grounded integrative framework designed to
capture and reflect the potentially different understandings and definitions
of partnership offered by actors directly involved in a variety of partnership
arrangements at work. The aim is to try to delineate more precisely the
conceptual and operational boundaries of the phenomenon as a basis for
gaining a better theoretical as well as empirical understanding of both the
nature and impact of partnership at work. Before presenting the main
elements of our analytical framework there are two general points, however,
that need highlighting.

The first relates to the fact that, as Donaldson and Preston (1995) have
argued in relation to studies of stakeholding, many analyses of partnership
contain and sometimes confuse normative, descriptive and instrumental
elements. In other words, there is an overlap between analyses of the
principles, practices and outcomes of partnership; between what partnership
ought to be about, what it contains when put into practice and what its
potential benefits might be. More generally, it could be argued that there
are direct parallels between the normative, descriptive and instrumental
dimensions identified by Donaldson and Preston (1995) in their analysis of
stakeholding, and an emphasis on the principles, practices and outcomes of
partnership. Principles have a normative element and, as we have seen, those
who have tried to define partnership have found it easier to highlight the
principles it ought to endorse rather than to list specific practices. The second
element, the descriptive element in Donaldson and Preston's analysis, has
a direct parallel in the practices that constitute partnership activity. Finally,
an instrumental perspective focuses on the outcomes, and in the case of
partnership we might expect mutual benefits for the relevant parties. Since
many of the practices that might be found in a partnership organization
could operate quite independently of partnership, a key feature of partner-
ship will be the close association between principles and practices and an
assumption that positive outcomes for the partners are more likely to occur

when a range of practices, reflecting the principles of concern to the main
partners, are in place. In other words, we are suggesting that a sensible
analysis of partnership needs to embrace all three elements of principles,
practices and outcomes and systematically to look at the interrelation
between them.

The second point relates to the key steps involved in developing an em-
pirically grounded approach to an understanding of partnership. We need to
gain validity by identifying principles, practices and outcomes that are
distinctly associated with those organizations that, on some basis, claim to
be practising partnership and are not present in other organizations. We
therefore need a sample of organizations that can be distinguished on the
basis of degrees of progress to partnership. We can add some nuances to
this: if we can identify a number of organizations that endorse partnership,
is it possible to detect in the principles and practices they endorse any
underlying patterns that enable us to identify the essence of partnership and
to locate it in the broader debates and perspectives discussed above? Second,
given the implicit meaning of partnership, is there any evidence that there
are benefits for the main partners from partnership activities? A strong
implication of these questions is that data should be collected from both
employer and employee perspectives and cross-checked.

This research will explore two of these issues. The first is to identify the
principles and practices that might be associated with partnership and to
determine how far they differ among those organizations that report more
or less progress towards partnership. The second is to determine whether
greater progress to partnership as well as distinctive emphases in partnership
are associated with outcomes of value to the parties involved. In developing
this research, we will build on the distinction between principles, practices
and outcomes. We also build on work in fields such as human resource
management (HRM), where a relationship is increasingly sought between
human resource practices and corporate performance (Becker and Gerhart
1996), as well as on the research of advocates of the benefits of the mutual
gains approach (Kochan and Osterman 1994). To develop the analysis and
demonstrate the parallels, we need to operationalize the core dimensions of
partnership and to present the relevant hypotheses.

3. Towards an operationalization of the dimensions of partnership

Analysing the Principles of Partnership

While principles or beliefs are usually analysed at the individual level, in this
case we are more interested in those that are perceived to be held by the
organization. Following Schein's (1992) analysis of organizational culture,
we can learn something of that culture from an analysis of its artefacts.
These include mission statements, vision and, with respect to partnership,
employment relations policy and strategy. These are likely to come together
in the principles that the organization endorses and which, in effect, serve as

the normative beliefs about partnership among the dominant coalition of
key policy-makers in the organization. In some well-known cases of joint
governance, principles are formally codified in a set of agreed rules; in
others they are reflected in an underlying statement of intent; and in still
others they are largely implicit (Cutcher-Gershenfeld and Verma 1994). We
need to go a step further in differentiating partnership principles that are
merely endorsed and those that are taken sufficiently seriously to be acted
upon. We also need a check on possible management biases by obtaining
responses from employee representatives as well as from managers. If the
principles of partnership are to be taken seriously and to have force, then
they should be sufficiently clearly espoused to be recognized and agreed by
both management and employee representatives.

There is no previous research that we have been able to identify that
explores and seeks to classify the range of possible principles concerning
partnership at work. Our study therefore aims to identify and seek under-
lying links between the potential principles of partnership. To validate these,
we would expect that those organizations that claim to have made more
progress towards partnership would report stronger endorsement of some or
all of the principles associated with the different approaches to partnership
discussed above.

Analysing the Practices of Partnership

While we might wish to explore how far any analytic description or classi-
fication of partnership reflects the reality of contemporary practice, we have
already argued that there are no adequate conceptual descriptions or
classifications. We are therefore thrown back upon empirical analysis. There
are two aspects to this. The first empirical question is how far organizations
are in fact employing practices that might reasonably be seen to be associ-
ated with the different approaches to partnership. The second, a repeat of
the simple validity test, is how far those organizations that claim to be
practising partnership are engaging in more of the practices associated with
the various approaches to partnership than those that do not. We hence-
forth refer to these practices as partnership practices. They include not only
various forms of direct and indirect participation at the workplace, but also
the type of progressive human resource practices associated with the unitarist
approaches to partnership discussed above. A more complex empirical ques-
tion is how far there is a logical association between related sets of principles
and practices of partnership. Our research therefore seeks to identify the prac-
tices associated with partnership, to identify any clusters of practices, to relate
these to principles and to explore any link to progress towards partnership.

Analysing the Outcomes of Partnership

A core assumption is that partnership brings benefits to the partners in
terms of the outcomes of interest to the partners. From an organizational

stakeholder perspective, partnership may be expected to lead to benefits
such as higher employee commitment to the organization, a greater will-
ingness to contribute to the organization, lower levels of absence, labour
turnover and industrial conflict, and superior performance, based on a
range of internal and external criteria. Provisional support for this propo-
sition can be found in the literature on the various forms of participation
and joint decision-making in the United States (Applebaum and Batt 1994;
Kochan and Osterman 1994) and in that on human resource management
(Arthur 1994; Huselid 1995; Delery and Doty 1996; Becker and Gerhart
1996). From an employee perspective, the benefits of partnership might be
expected to include opportunities to exercise greater autonomy and direct
participation (Batt and Applebaum 1995); a more positive psychological
contract (Rousseau 1995; Guest, 2000); and an opportunity to share in the
financial gains through employee share ownership (Blinder 1990). In addi-
tion to employees as a group, it is possible to identify employee represen-
tatives as a distinct interest group for whom the key outcomes, leaving aside
the benefits to those they represent, are likely to be found in the degree of
influence they are able to exert over employment and wider issues and in the
robustness of the structures, such as works councils and trade unions, within
which they work. In exploring the impact of the various forms of partici-
pation on outcomes, there has been extensive debate about whether direct or
representative, on-line or off-line practices have the greater impact. Where
comparison has been possible (Batt and Applebaum 1995), direct or on-line
practices have been found to have the greater impact. However, a number of
commentators, including Batt and Applebaum and Kochan et al. (1986),
have argued that the best results will be gained through a complementary
approach, when direct and indirect forms of participation are used in com-
bination with each other. Our research therefore explores the association
between various combinations of partnership practices and outcomes.

Integrating the Components of Partnership

At the heart of the analysis in this paper is the proposition that there will be
a link between the principles, practices and outcomes of partnership. As
noted earlier, this type of analysis is taken partly from the research literature
on HRM, which seeks a link between strategies, practices and outcomes.
That literature (Becker and Gerhart 1996) has now begun to draw attention
to the lack of explanation of how human resource practices might be related
to outcomes and more particularly to organizational performance. In this
study we seek to fill this gap; we extend the analysis by examining the impact
of partnership on a range of employee and management outcomes. The
rationale for this is that the adoption of partnership principles and practices
will enhance perceptions of a more positive psychological contract among
employees and will increase their influence and that of their representatives
over work-related and possibly wider decisions. This will
improve the
quality of decisions and should result in higher commitment and higher

extra-role contributions by employees. It will also result in lower levels of
turnover, absence and conflict. These more positive intermediate outcomes
will have both a direct and an indirect impact on productivity, quality and
innovation, which in turn will affect sales and financial results (Delaney and
Huselid 1996). As Cutcher-Gershenfeld and Verma (1994) note, it is these
potential benefits of partnership, together with the scope they provide to cut
middle management costs, that have made this approach attractive to senior
policy-makers in organizations. In this study we extend the conventional
analysis of partnership by incorporating the principles. In doing so, we are
extending the arguments for integrating practices to claim that it will be
equally important to reinforce practices with strong support among organ-
ization policy-makers and senior line managers for the principles that
underpin the practices.

4. Methods and measures

Sample and Data Collection

in the UK,

Since partnership is believed to be relatively novel
it was
necessary to identify a sample that might contain organizations that had
made some progress towards partnership. This was achieved by using the
membership of the Involvement and Participation Association (IPA), a
body dedicated to the promotion of partnership and related issues in
industry. Its council contains senior figures from industry, the trade unions
and relevant government agencies and its current membership consists of
about 180 mainly large organizations. It is therefore not representative of
industry as a whole, but can be expected to contain organizations that, to
varying degrees, offer some support to the concept of partnership.

The sample consisted of all current and past members of the IPA that
could be contacted. While this totalled almost 300 organizations, follow-up
analysis suggested that about 240 questionnaires had reached their target
audience since some companies had changed location, been taken over or
gone out of business. Questionnaires were sent for completion to the named
organizational representative, usually the HR director or CEO, together
with a second questionnaire which he or she was asked to pass on to the
senior employee representative for completion and return. Questionnaires
were sent out in June 1997, and after a reminder 82 management ques-
tionnaires and 65 employee representative questionnaires were returned.
These included 54 pairs of questionnaires from the same organization.

Based on the employer sample, the responses confirmed that many of the
organizations were large (mean 11,293, standard deviation (s.d.) 31,197)
with 33 per cent employing 10,000 or more, although 27 per cent employed
less than 500. Of these, 42 per cent were in manufacturing, 31 per cent in
private-sector services and the remainder in public-sector services and other
miscellaneous categories; 85 per cent were British owned and 10 per cent

American owned. The mean age of the organizations was 76 years (s.d. 71
years); 72 per cent recognized a trade union for purposes of collective
bargaining, and in 51 per cent of the organizations over half the employees
belonged to a trade union. While the proportion recognizing a trade union
is well above the national average, it is not far from the average for large
organizations.

Development and Measurement of Progress to Partnership

Although progress to partnership could be inferred from the evidence about
principles, practices and performance, it was considered essential to obtain
an independent subjective assessment of progress towards partnership.
Three items were constructed for this purpose: `This organization is strongly
committed to the principles of partnership'; `This organization is a partner-
ship organization' and `This organization still has some way to go to achieve
a fully effective partnership between management and employees'. Re-
sponses were provided on a five-point scale, from `strongly agree' (5) to
`strongly disagree' (1). When scaled, the measure had an alpha of 0.72. In
the matched sub-sample of 54 organizations, there were no significant
differences in the responses of management and employee representatives to
these statements. This measure can therefore be used to provide some sort of
internal validity check. Detailed scores are presented in Table 1. Closer
analysis indicated that, allowing for the reverse-scored item, there were 15
organizations with a mean score above 4.00, which were therefore reporting
a high level of progress, 21 organizations with a mean score between 3.00
and 3.99, which were making moderate progress and a further 18 organ-
izations with a mean score on the three items of below 3.00, which were
making low progress towards partnership. So even among the IPA member-
ship, 33 per cent reported relatively low progress towards partnership and
only 28 per cent claimed to have made a high level of progress. This sub-
division was subsequently used as part of the validity check.

Development and Measurement of Principles of Partnership

A survey of the literature revealed no prior measures of principles of
partnership. Items were therefore identified on the basis of the literature
review, extensive discussions with IPA representatives and a number of
preliminary interviews with employers and trade unions. Questionnaires
were then piloted on a small sample of IPA members and amended as
appropriate. We identified 15 possible principles which were measured
through 26 items to which individuals responded on a five-point scale from
`It is a principle the organization opposes' (1) through `The organization
would probably claim to support this principle but is unlikely to give it
much priority in practice' (3) to `It is a principle the organization strongly
supports, makes determined steps to practise and monitors to ensure
implementation' (5). It can be seen from these response categories that the

items measure the extent to which the organization is believed to support
or oppose each principle, together with some indication of how strong the
support is, as reflected in action to translate principles into practice. If the
principles reflect some underlying concept of partnership, then we would
expect them to receive a stronger endorsement in those organizations that
have made more progress towards partnership.

Following preliminary factor analysis, we retained the 15 items that most
clearly represented the 15 principles and subjected these to a further factor
analysis (principal components with varimax rotation) using the responses
of the sample of 108 management and employee representatives from the
matched organizations. A factor loading of 0.40 was used as the cut-off
point. The analysis identified four main factors which are shown in Table 2;
the table shows the average level of endorsement of each item, based on the
pooled responses of employer and employee representative in those organ-
izations that reported low, medium or high levels of progress towards
partnership.

The principles support the idea of mutuality. Respondents from organ-
izations that had made greater progress towards partnership were signifi-
cantly more likely to report strong internal support for the idea that the
organization should have a responsibility to treat its employees well, to
ensure employee rights and benefits and to create a context in which
employees have an opportunity to contribute. In return, employees are seen
as having a responsibility to contribute by displaying commitment, flexi-
bility and quality of work. The principles identified through the analysis fit
comfortably with those outlined by the IPA. Given the derivation of the
sample, this is not altogether surprising. They also fit reasonably well with

those of the TUC, but it is notable that the one item that does not get
stronger endorsement with increasing progress towards partnership is con-
cerned with the formal recognition of collective bargaining, raising interest-
ing questions about the role of pluralism in partnership.

The results in Table 2 show that there is a generally strong endorsement of
the principles of partnership. There are, however, significant differences in
levels of endorsement linked to progress towards partnership on all but
two of the 15 items. This provides some face validity for the ability of the
principles to reflect partnership activity. It is also worth noting that the
principles considered to be most strongly endorsed by organizations are
those concerned with the employee responsibilities to make a contribution,
while those least strongly endorsed concern employee rights and benefits.
This is particularly noticeable among those organizations that reported only
low progress towards partnership. The mutuality may, in other words, be
a little lopsided. This is reflected in the differences between the overall
responses of employer and employee representatives on the factor concerned
with perceptions of how far the organization endorses aspects of `good
treatment of employees'.

Development and Measurement of Partnership Practices

A review of the literature again revealed no specific measure of partnership
practices. However, there is an extensive literature on employee participa-
tion (Heller et al. 1998; Strauss 1992; Wagner 1994), on the mutual gains
approach (Kochan et al. 1986; Kochan and Osterman 1994) and on human
resource management (Arthur 1994; Huselid 1995; MacDuffie 1995; Becker
and Gerhart 1996) that provides lists of possible practices. On the basis of
this material, a list of practices was drawn up and subsequently refined after
extensive discussions and interviews with IPA representatives and senior
managers and union representatives and some pilot testing.

The list contained nine items concerned with what might be described as
direct worker involvement in decisions, a majority of which were taken from
a measure developed for the Industrial Democracy in Europe Study (IDE
1993) (see Table 3a). A further ten items, adapted from the IDE study and
from the 1990 UK Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (Millward et al.
1992), are concerned with representative involvement in and influence over
decisions (see Table 3b). The survey also contained 29 human resource
practices, drawn mainly from the HRM literature, and divided into two
groups. For 16 of these practices, a straight yes/no response was required
since this was the logical response (for example, to aspects of harmonization
and single status) (see Table 3d). For the remaining 13 practices, on the
other hand, a six-point scale was used to indicate the extent to which the
practice was implemented, ranging from `applies to less than 10% of
employees' (1) to `applies to more than 90% of employees' (6) (see Table 3c).
To reduce the item-to-sample ratio in factor analysis, the following
procedure was adopted. Items were first grouped on an a priori basis into a

# Blackwell Publishers Ltd/London School of Economics 2001.


Partnership at Work

221

number of logical subgroups. Where possible, these were then subjected to
Cronbach's alpha to determine whether they formed an acceptable scale;
alternatively, items with a yes/no response were combined and counted.
These grouped categories were then subjected to factor analysis (principal
components with varimax rotation) using once again the sample of 108
matched management and employee respondents. This resulted in eight
factors. The eight factors reflect familiar distinctions between direct and
representative participation and a series of human resource practices. In
short, this could be interpreted to suggest that partnership in practice
consists of a combination of workers' participation and progressive human
resource management practices. The eight factors are labelled as follows:

1. direct participation by employees in decisions about their own work;
2. direct participation by employees in decisions about personal employ-

ment issues;

3. participation by employee representatives in decisions about employ-

ment issues;

4. participation by employee representatives in decisions about broader

organizational policy issues;

5. flexible job design and focus on quality;
6. performance management;
7. employee share ownership;
8. communication, harmonization and employment security.

a The responses were provided on a five-point scale as follows: (1) None; (2) A little; (3) Some;
(4) Quite a deal; (5) A great deal.

Two points are worth emphasizing in these results. First is the high level
of agreement on these somewhat more objective issues between employer
and employee representatives; indeed, the only issue on which there is a
significant difference is training, and the direction of the difference across
the items concerned with training is not consistent. The second point is the
generally low level of direct participation in work decisions and of represen-
tative participation in organizational decisions. In contrast, there is much
more use of the range of human resource management practices. Again,
there are questions about the interpretation of mutuality and the balance of
benefit. This can perhaps be best assessed through the analysis of outcomes.

Development and Measurement of Outcomes

In most analyses of partnership at work, the key partners are normally
considered to be managers, employees and employee representatives. There
are occasional references to the community and to shareholders, but these
are rarely given as much emphasis although the concerns of shareholders
may be inferred to be similar to those of management. There is again no
systematic guidance in the literature about the outcomes of partnership. As
noted above, however, there is an extensive literature on employee and
management outcomes of employee relations, and we drew heavily on this.

(a) Employee outcomes
Employee outcomes were measured through items designed to assess the
state of the psychological contract. The psychological contract is increasingly

a For the practices that could apply to a part of the work-force, we asked for a response on the
following dimension: (1) Applies to less than 10% of employees; (2) Applies to between 10%
and 30% of employees; (3) Applies to between 31% and 50% of employees; (4) Applies to
between 51% and 70% of employees; (5) Applies to between 71% and 90% of employees;
(6) Applies to more than 90% of employees.

used as a measure of the extent to which mutual promises and obligations
on the part of employer and employees have been met (Rousseau 1995).
In this case we were concerned with the evaluation of the state of the
psychological contract reflected in judgements about fairness, trust and
delivery of the `deal' by management. This measure has been used in
previous UK research using employees and has been shown to be a single
factor (Guest and Conway 1997). In this case a restricted three-item version
was used (alpha = 0.67). Respondents were asked to rate, on a five-point
scale, from `very low' (1) to `very high' (5), the following items: `levels of
trust between employees and management'; `the fairness with which people
are treated' and `the sense of employment security'. In this study, unlike in

previous research, the responses are based on judgements by managers or
employee representatives rather than the employees themselves. The results
in Table 4 reveal that this is the only outcome item on which the responses
of employee representatives are significantly lower than those of managers.

(b) Employee representative outcomes
These were not directly assessed. They could be inferred from responses
to the items concerned with employee representative participation in and
influence over decisions described above.

(c) Management outcomes
Management outcomes were assessed through measures of employee re-
sponse, employment relations outcomes and organizational performance
outcomes. First, judgements about three sets of employee responses were
obtained. One of these was concerned with the level of active engagement in

Partnership at Work

the partnership process. Respondents were asked to rate, on a five-point scale
from `very low' (1) to `very high' (5), the following items: `the contribution
of employees through participation and partnership systems';
`levels of
active involvement of employees in partnership systems' and `the contri-
bution of employee involvement and partnership to the success of the
business'. These items, when combined, yielded a scale with an alpha score
of 0.87.

The second employee response was concerned with evidence of employee
commitment to the organization through partnership, incorporating dimen-
sions which have been cited as reflecting both the content and consequences
of commitment (Lincoln and Kalleberg 1990; Applebaum and Batt 1994).
Six items, based on the same five-point rating scale, measured this. These
concerned `the commitment of employees', `the flexibility of employees', `the
quality of employees', `the quality of two-way communication', `employee
identification with the values of the company' and `employee support for
changes required to improve organizational effectiveness'. These were com-
bined into a scale with an alpha of 0.83.

The third measure is concerned with employee contribution and reflects the
view that appropriate practices lead to increased employee willingness to
innovate (Cutcher-Gershenfeld and Verma 1994). It consisted of two items
(alpha = 0.73), again measured on the same five-point scale: `the quality of
ideas and suggestions coming from employees' and `the contribution to
innovation coming from employees'. These three measures of engagement in
partnership, employee commitment and employee contribution, while
ostensibly employer measures, could also be construed as relevant outcomes
from an employee perspective. There are no significant differences between
manager and employee representatives on any of these outcome measures.
The descriptive results for these attitudinal outcomes are shown in Table 4.
The second set of management outcomes is concerned with aspects of
employment relations and focuses on labour retention, absence and conflict.
Responses were rated on the same five-point scale from `very low' (1) to `very
high' (5). Labour retention was measured with two items (alpha = 0.51)
concerned with `the level of labour turnover' and `the ability to retain key
employees'. Absence and conflict were measured with single items relating
to `the level of absence' and `the level of conflict'. It should be noted that
levels of conflict were generally rated as very low. The results are shown in
Table 5.

The final set of outcome measures is concerned with organizational per-
formance. Rather than obtaining general ratings, we followed the practice
adopted in a number of other self-report surveys where the unit of analysis is
sometimes below that of the company or organization as a whole (Delaney
and Huselid 1996; Millward et al. 1992; Cully et al. 1999) and asked about
comparative performance. The question therefore was `Compared to your
leading competitors, how would you rate your organization's performance
over the past two years on these indicators?' The response categories ranged
from `much worse' (1) through `about the same' (3) to `much better' (5).

Nine items covering internal and external indicators of performance were
presented. Factor analysis revealed that these divided neatly into two
categories. The first factor contained three items, `productivity of the work-
force', `quality of goods and services' and `product/service innovation', and
is labelled Internal Performance. The second factor contained measures of
performance that are more external in orientation. These were `ability to
retain existing customers',
`profit
margins' and `overall profitability' and is simply labelled Sales/Profits. The
two factors, when scaled, had alpha values of 0.64 and 0.90 respectively. The
results are shown in Table 6.

In collecting much of this information, and particularly the information
on organizational performance, through subjective measures, we were aware
of the potential risks. However, given the range of types of organization and
our knowledge that some of them were responding for headquarters and
some for divisions and some for single plants, we felt that this was likely to
provide the most accurate comparative information. The one limitation with
this is that we did not collect company performance ratings from employee
representatives on the grounds that they would not be in a good position to
report these data.

5. Relating principles, practices and outcomes

In this section we will concentrate on the link between partnership practices
and outcomes. We concentrate on practices rather than principles because

they are likely to reflect the enactment of principles. However, to support
this we first need to consider the relationship between principles and practices.
The significant associations are shown in Table 7 and confirm the strong
links, albeit the varying strength of some of the associations is not always
what might be expected.

The relationship between partnership practices and outcomes is shown in
Table 8. This analysis uses OLS regressions on the combined management
and employee representative sample to explore the impact of each of the
practices on the full range of outcomes, with the exception of the organiz-
ational performance measures, for which data were collected only from
management in the 54 matched organizations (valid n = 49). In each
analysis we controlled for organization size and sector with manufacturing
serving as the reference category. To explore the effect of combining prac-
tices, we created new measures of participation in the form of dummy vari-
ables. These were: low levels of both direct and representative participation,
which serves as a reference category in the analysis; high direct and low
representative participation (labelled `direct participation' in Table 8); low
direct and high representative participation (labelled `representative partici-
pation' in Table 8); and high direct and high representative participation
(labelled `direct and representative participation' in Table 8). These new

participation measures, together with the four human resource management
factors of job design, performance management, communication/harmon-
ization and employee share ownership, were then used as predictors of
the various outcome measures. To simplify the analysis, we combined the
`intermediate' employee and management outcome measures concerned
with the state of the psychological contract, and with employee engagement
in the partnership process, commitment to the organization and contri-
bution,
into an overall measure of employee attitudes and behaviour
(alpha = 0.87).

The first equation in Table 8 shows the impact of the participation vari-
ables and human resource practices on the overall measure of employee
attitudes and behaviour. The second and third equations show the impact
of this overall measure of employee attitudes and behaviour, together with
the participation variables and human resource practices on the employee
relations outcomes of labour retention and absence, respectively. The fourth
equation shows the impact of all the previous variables on our measure
of internal organizational performance, while the last equation shows the
impact of internal performance, along with the previous variables, on
organizational sales/profits (i.e. external performance).

The results broadly confirm an association between partnership practices
and a range of employee and employer-related outcomes. Thus, the first
regression indicates that combined high levels of both direct and
representative participation, as well as flexible forms of job design, are
significantly associated with more positive attitudes and behaviours. In turn,
positive employee attitudes and behaviours, together with employee share
ownership, are associated with more positive labour retention and absence
outcomes. The fourth column shows that they are also associated with
higher levels of internal organizational performance, which in turn, as the
final column shows, is associated with more positive sales and profits.
Overall, therefore, the results are quite positive. There are, however, some
complexities in the results, which are discussed in the next section.

6. Discussion and conclusions

The concept of partnership is now widely used in the rhetoric and the
practice of contemporary industrial relations. Any useful discourse and
analysis of the phenomenon, therefore, requires some shared understanding
of the nature and meaning of partnership, as well as of its potential impact.
In line with these concerns, the aim of the research reported here was to
identify principles and practices of partnership, to describe and assess the
extent of the practice of partnership in organizations that might have been
expected to have made some progress towards partnership, and to assess the
impact of partnership on outcomes likely to be of interest to the key
partners.

A dearth of useful literature dealing directly with partnership was noted.
Three main perspectives on partnership were identified, however, which we
labelled the pluralist, unitarist and hybrid approaches to the phenomenon.
Building on these approaches, and drawing on the traditional industrial
relations literature, as well as on the mainstream human resource manage-
ment and organizational behaviour literature, we developed an integrated
framework for the analysis of partnership. On the basis of this literature,
and drawing also on work on stakeholder theory, this conceptual frame-
work distinguishes principles, practices and outcomes of partnership and
places particular emphasis on mutuality and trust as distinctive features of
partnership.

The empirical analysis identified four main principles of partnership and
eight classes of partnership practice. It showed, importantly, that endorse-
ment of principles by the organization was associated with greater progress
to partnership, indicating some validity for the view that these are indeed
principles of partnership. The analysis also confirmed a link implying that
support for certain principles results in the use of related practices. In
addition, the research has confirmed that the use of certain partnership
practices is associated with outcomes that are relevant and likely to be con-
sidered positive by the key partners. Furthermore, the nature of the linkages

suggests that positive organizational outcomes of interest to employers
depend for their achievement upon the prior achievement of outcomes likely
to be relevant to employees and their representatives. In summary, the
research has identified and measured principles, practices and outcomes of
partnership and shown that these are positively associated. Taken overall,
therefore, the results can be seen as a positive endorsement of the concept of
partnership.

Despite this positive general conclusion, the results are far from straight-
forward, more particularly with respect to the link between partnership and
performance. Some of the problems may result from the limited sample size.
We have restricted our analysis to those 54 organizations from which we had
responses from both employer and employee representatives, rather than
from the full 93 for which we had some information from either a manage-
ment or employee representative. The limited sample size forced us to
undertake certain analyses and to combine variables in ways that a larger
sample would not have required. It is also possible that, with a larger sample
and a greater range of types of organization (bearing in mind that our sample
was drawn from the membership of the Involvement and Participation
Association), more results would have been statistically significant. With
these provisos about the sample size and make-up and the related analysis,
there are a number of points that should be highlighted.

The first point is essentially descriptive. For a group of organizations that
might be expected to engage in high trust forms of partnership, the level of
direct participation in work decisions and representative participation in
wider organizational policy decisions is generally low. This suggests that,
even in these presumably more favourable settings, management trust in
employees and their representatives remains relatively low. The second point
gives further grounds for some scepticism about the commitment among
senior management to the idea of partnership. Arguably, mutuality lies at
the core of the concept of partnership; yet the results from the manager and
more particularly the employee representatives suggest that the mutuality
may be somewhat unbalanced. The analysis of the principles that are en-
dorsed and of the practices that are in place indicates that greater emphasis
is placed on employee contribution than on promotion of employee welfare
and rights and independent representation. In many cases, management
would appear to be gaining more from the practice of partnership. This
provides fertile grounds for those such as Kelly (1999) who have been
critical of partnership. What we have, therefore, is constrained mutuality
with the balance of advantage, in terms of principles endorsed and practices
in place, leaning clearly towards management.

However, evidence of a balance of advantage for management across the
organizations in this sample is not in itself an argument against partnership.
The analysis of the link between partnership practices and a range of
outcomes confirms that a high trust form of partnership, based on extensive
direct participation in work decisions and representative participation in
company decisions, is associated with the most positive outcomes for the

three main types of partner, namely employers, employees and employee
representatives. For employers it is reflected in higher employee contri-
bution, better employment relations outcomes and superior performance;
for employees there is a better psychological contract and greater voice,
including scope to contribute; and for employee representatives the process
engages them more fully in decision-making over a wider range of issues.
Moreover, the importance of mutual advantage is reflected in the absence of
a direct link between partnership practices and performance. It is only when
employees are engaged, in terms of attitudes and behaviour, that perform-
ance gains are apparent, implying that too great a distortion in the balance
of advantage would fail to lead to positive performance outcomes.

The results imply that there are dangers in seeking to be selective about
what practices to support, since not all practices and elements of partnership
have a positive effect and some do not if applied in isolation. Direct par-
ticipation and job design, which might be expected to overlap, are strongly
associated with positive employee attitudes and behaviour. Representative
participation has no significant positive effect on employee attitudes and
behaviour and, if considered on its own as the only form of partnership, has
a negative impact on sales and profits. One possible explanation for this
is that representative participation on its own will fail to overcome low levels
of trust. In contrast, the combined use of direct and representative par-
ticipation, together with an emphasis on job design and quality, has the
most positive effect on employee attitudes and behaviour. None of the other
human resource factors has a significant positive link to employee attitudes
and behaviour. However, employee share ownership schemes have a signifi-
cant and positive association with higher retention of staff, lower absence
and higher internal performance. It appears that a bundle of partnership
practices associated with direct and representative participation, job design
and a focus on quality, and the additional use of employee share ownership,
will produce the most positive outcomes for all the partners. Using some of
these, and most notably representative participation in isolation, will not
produce similar benefits.

Alongside this survey, we undertook a number of case studies to identify
factors leading to the introduction and subsequent maintenance of partner-
ship. These reinforce the importance for a range of outcomes of building
trust and of sustaining it through appropriate institutional arrangements.
There is clearly more to be done on the role of trust in effective partnership
at work. As this research indicates, levels of trust are generally low, so only a
minority of these organizations are gaining the potential benefits of partner-
ship. A key challenge for further research is therefore to identify the pro-
cesses that must be in place for high trust to emerge.

In this study, we have sought to break new ground by mapping the
principles, practices and outcomes of partnership. Our data were collected
from key employee representatives rather than from employees themselves,
and there is a risk that some of the representatives become key actors in the
partnership process and develop a commitment to it that might not be

endorsed so enthusiastically by a majority of employees. More research is
therefore needed, ideally longitudinal in nature, to monitor the attitudes and
behaviour of a range of managers and employees, as well as core represen-
tatives of both management and employees, in the partnership process.

Despite these limitations, we do believe this study has succeeded in de-
scribing the principles, practices and outcomes that represent partnership at
work, and in showing links between them. In doing so, we imply that some
practices that were included in the full list may be more important than
others, but further research is needed to verify this. We have also shown
how partnership can lead to potential benefits for all the partners. The
analysis has highlighted the role of mutuality and trust as key and possibly
distinctive features of partnership and has drawn attention to the dangers
for partnership where the balance of advantage within a process of mutu-
ality errs too far in favour of management. Given the boundaries apparently
imposed on partnership in many of the organizations in our sample, there is
a risk that the benefits for all partners that we have indicated have the
potential to accrue will not be realized, leaving partnership as a hollow
promise.
