Abstract
Purpose – To investigate the impact of EMS certiﬁcation on the performance of ﬁrms, including
economic and environmental aspects and perceived customer satisfaction.
Design/methodology/approach – The purpose of this study is hypotheses testing in order to
explain the variance in the dependent variable (ﬁrms’ performance in terms of economic and
environmental aspects) by establishing the nature of the relationship between the dependent variable
and the independent variables through the testing of the hypotheses.
Findings – The results reveal that certiﬁcation impacts positively on both the environmental and
economic performance of enterprises. Respondents perceived “enhanced corporate image” to be the
strongest impact of certiﬁcation, and they believe that the beneﬁts obtained from EMS certiﬁcation far
outweigh the cost of its implementation.
Research limitations/implications – The study only surveyed ISO 14001-certiﬁed ﬁrms. Future
research should include non-certiﬁed ﬁrms.
Practical implications – To improve the quality of the environment there needs to be a partnership
between government, businesses and the community.
Originality/value – ISO 14001 certiﬁcation has a positive impact on ﬁrms’ performance, speciﬁcally
on perceived economic impact, perceived environmental impact and perceived customer satisfaction.
By failing to perceive a marketing opportunity from using this well-known standard, ﬁrms can lose
market share.

1. Introduction
The ability of corporations to manage their environmental performance is emerging
as a strategic issue for many companies worldwide. This is primarily because the
environment is now regarded as an asset to be valued. Consequently, managers
today are not only expected to reduce lead times, improve quality, reduce costs and
enhance ﬂexibility,
they are also expected to become more environmentally
responsible (Montabon et al., 2000). In response to the pressing need for companies
to address the impact of enterprises’ activities on the environment, in 1996 the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) introduced the ISO 14000 series
of standards.

The standards, claimed to be less confrontational and user-friendly, may provide
a potentially innovative supplement to current environmental regulations (Murray,

1999). The series of standards will help companies integrate environmental
considerations into corporate decision-making in a more organized and systematic
fashion (Gale, 1996). While the ISO 14000 family of standards deals with various
matters concerning the environment,
the standard that primarily focuses on
environmental management systems (EMS) is ISO 14001. ISO 14001 is designed to
introduce environmental improvement into every aspect of a company’s operations,
and offers an organized approach to manage environmental issues. The focus of the
standard is on the entire organizational structure of the business, thus bringing
environmental issues into the mainstream of the corporate decision-making process.
Given that businesses are increasingly asserting their role as responsible social
players and regarding environmental concerns as an integral part of their daily
operations, the ISO 14001 standard may well be an indicator of a company’s
commitment to environmental responsibility (Tucker and Kasper, 1998; Murray,
1999).

In Malaysia, as in other countries with diverse economies, the ISO 14001 standard
has thrown down a challenge to businesses, especially in environmentally sensitive
industries such as heavy manufacturing, chemicals, semiconductors, mining and
agriculture. The challenge is for them play a proactive role in the instigation and/or
enhancement of the organization’s environmental management systems (EMS). The
creators of ISO 14001 were careful to ensure that it is applicable to organizations of
varying sizes and circumstances, not just large corporations or those with economic
leverage. Gaining ISO 14001 certiﬁcation is one way in which a company is able to
demonstrate to its customers, suppliers, competitors and the regulators that it is
serious about environmental stewardship (Murray, 1999). However, many companies
are still doubtful as to whether or not getting certiﬁcation (Petroni, 2001) actually
brings with it the numerous advantages claimed. In particular, companies want to
know whether or not the beneﬁts of certiﬁcation actually exceed its costs. Research into
the impact of ISO 14001 on a company’s economic and environmental performances is
lacking, especially in Malaysia. It is thus the objective of this study to address this
issue by examining economic and environmental performance and other related issues
of ISO 14001 certiﬁed companies in Malaysia.

2. Statement of the problem
The intention of the ISO 14001 standard is to drive environmental improvements
worldwide through a systematic approach to environmental management. However,
debates about the value of ISO 14001 and its ability to meet its lofty intentions have
been going on since the early 1990s and continue today, even after several years of
experience with implementation and registration to the standard. Although many
proponents of the standard (Balta and Woodside, 1999) agree that ISO 14001 has met
and in some instances has exceeded the intentions of its creators, there are those who
feel that the monetary investment required for implementation and registration is not
offset by tangible beneﬁts. Skeptics think that overall, ISO 14001 will not improve the
world’s environmental situation because it does not set environmental performance or
technology criteria. Further,
they believe organizations that already have an
established EMS will see little beneﬁt from aligning their systems with the standard.
Indeed, they think that there may even be a downside to implementing the standard,


such as added bureaucracy and requirements for extensive, unnecessary
documentation.

The high cost of ISO 14001 implementation, which varies from company to
company (Balta and Woodside, 1999), might actually result in the redirection of
resources away from investment in more environmentally friendly processes. It is
also part of the interest of this research to investigate whether or not the beneﬁts
of certiﬁcation actually exceed its costs. Nevertheless, some emphatically agree
with the proponents of the standard, i.e. that the implementation and registration
process is well worth the expenditure of resources, and that the beneﬁts derived
from the process are tangible and indeed exceed expectations – and all at an
affordable cost!

3. Research objectives
The main objectives of this study are:

.

.

to investigate the impacts of EMS certiﬁcation on ﬁrms’ performance, such as
economic and environmental aspects and perceived customer satisfaction; and
to examine the beneﬁts of adopting the ISO 14001 standard and to ascertain
whether or not
the beneﬁts of EMS certiﬁcation actually outweigh its
implementation cost.

This study attempts to answer the following questions:

. What is the impact of ISO 14001 certiﬁcation on ﬁrms’ performance, such as
economic and environmental aspects and perceived customer satisfaction? How
is the performance of ﬁrms inﬂuenced by factors such as past experience with
ISO 9000, operational orientation toward environmental
responsibility,
companies’ ISO 14001 strategy, their ISO 14001 culture, the importance of
international trade, and the functional positions of the respondents?

. Do the beneﬁts of EMS certiﬁcation actually outweigh its implementation cost?

4. Environmental management systems and ﬁrms’ performance
4.1 What is an environmental management system (EMS)?
In today’s global economy, organizations are increasingly called upon to
demonstrate sound management of economic, social and environmental
issues.
Evidence suggests that a focus on this “triple bottom line” results in advantages in
ﬁnancing,
regulatory treatment, and other areas. An
environmental management system (EMS) is a structured approach to addressing
the environmental bottom line. ISO 14001 is the world’s most recognized EMS
framework that helps organizations both to manage better the impact of their
activities on the
sound environmental
management. Since the publication of ISO 14001 in 1996, many companies have
implemented the standard and, by the end of 2001, nearly 37,000 organizations in
112 countries had their EMSs certiﬁed as conforming to its requirements. ISO 14001
is designed to be ﬂexible enough to be applied to any size of organization in both
the private and public sectors. The bottom line is that certiﬁcation to ISO 14001 can
improve environmental management and enables equal access to a growing “green”
marketplace (Montabon et al., 2000).

The ISO 14000 environmental standards specify the structure of information
technology, in the form of an EMS, that an organization must have in place if it seeks to
obtain certiﬁcation of the EMS according to ISO guidelines. The ISO 14000 standards
describe the basic elements of an effective EMS. These elements include creating an
environmental policy that sets out objectives and targets, implementing a program to
achieve those objectives, monitoring and measuring its effectiveness, correcting
problems, and reviewing the system to improve it and overall environmental
performance (Tibor and Feldman, 1996). ISO 14000’s EMS standards are process
standards, not performance standards. In other words, these standards do not tell
organizations what environmental performance they must achieve aside from
compliance with environmental regulations. Instead, the standards describe a system
that will help an organization to achieve its own objectives and targets. The
assumption is that better environmental management will indirectly lead to better
environmental performance (Tibor and Feldman, 1996).

4.2 How do ISO 9000 and ISO 14001 compare?
According to an article published by Fredericks and McCallum (1995), ISO 14001 does
not replace ISO 9000. A company with an ISO 9000 registration has a good foundation
for ISO 14001 and both are part of an organization’s overall management system. ISO
14001 also does not replace regulations, legislation and codes of practice (such as
Responsible Care) that an organization has to comply with. Rather, it provides a
system for monitoring, controlling and improving performance regarding those
requirements. ISO 14001 uses the same fundamental systems as ISO 9000, such as
documentation control, management system auditing, operational control, control of
records, management policies, audits, training, statistical techniques, and corrective
and preventive action. There are also some deﬁnite differences. Besides the similarities,
ISO 14001 has clearer statements about communication, competence and economics
than are currently found in ISO 9000. Also, ISO 14001 incorporates the setting of
objectives and quantiﬁed targets, preparedness for emergencies, considering the view
of interested parties, and public disclosure of environmental policy.

To date, no research has addressed whether ISO 14000 will be widely used by
businesses as a consensus model, or whether it should be. Instead, the literature is
saturated with conﬂicting predictions and viewpoints offered by experts. The
champions of ISO 14000 suggest that it will unify countries in their approach to
environmental management and will eventually be looked upon more favorably than
traditional measures (Cascio, 1994). Hammer (1996) argues that small manufacturing
ﬁrms constitute the largest potential market for ISO 14000, and that the real test of the
standards can be measured by adoption rates among these ﬁrms, which typically need
the most direction in these issues. According to Hammer (1996), the development to
watch is what industrial customers do with these standards with regard to their supply
chains. Acceptance of the standards will come when conformance or certiﬁcation
becomes a condition for customer requirements. This suggests that the predisposition
of corporations to ISO 14000 will mostly inﬂuence the adoption rates and, ultimately,
the success of these standards. However, no research to date has examined the views of
managers on ISO 14000 and the relative impact of this new approach on their view of
the effectiveness and efﬁciency of corporate environmental management systems, as

well as the impact of ISO 14000 on corporate performance. This concern forms the
major impetus for this study.

4.3 Impacts on companies’ performance
As discussed in the previous section, having an ISO 14001 EMS will help enhance a
ﬁrm’s economic performance and at the same time improve its environmental
performance. The beneﬁts of
ISO 14001 lie in cost savings through energy
consumption, raw material input, waste management, environmental impact reversal
as well as an improved public image (Chattopadhyay, 2001). Implementing ISO 14001
has also helped one of Rockwell’s automation plants reduce its hazardous waste by 18
percent. Ford’s Lima engine plant reduced its piston tin-plating process, resulting in a
reduction in water usage by 2.4 million gallons annually (Moretz, 2000). Lockheed
Martin’s Syracuse plant was able to reduce its wastewater reduction by 86 percent,
solid waste reduction by 78 percent and process waste reduction by 34 percent. In
addition, recycling at the plant improved by 22 percent (Moretz, 2000). Hogarth (1999),
in her study of Milan Screw, a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) in Michigan,
reported cost savings of $20,000 when the company designed a better oil removal
system as a result of putting in place an ISO 14001 EMS. One company reported that it
was not only able to recycle 94 percent of its waste, but that the company was also able
to create a proﬁt center (Fielding, 1999).

industry codes, etc.) that a company must comply with. Rather,

Despite the hype it has been receiving, environmental management according to
ISO 14001 (McCallum and Fredericks, 1996) is not a magic potion. It will not save the
world, nor will it save your company, or the board of directors. It is a management
system – that is all. It does not replace the common environmental performance levels
(regulations,
it
provides a system for tracking, managing and improving performance regarding those
requirements. In another research study, Montabon et al. (2000) suggest that companies
overall do not see environmental management systems in a positive light. In general,
they conclude that these systems are perceived as having a strong negative impact on
the major strategic dimensions of a company’s performance (i.e. lead time, costs, and
quality), and that these systems do not enhance a ﬁrm’s competitive position in the
marketplace, nor do they improve a ﬁrm’s ability to sell its products internationally.
The authors found that a company’s attitude toward the standards was inﬂuenced by
the progress of its plant in attaining ISO 14000 certiﬁcation.

Although it is still too early to evaluate fully the effects that ISO 14001 will have on
marketplace advantage, some areas have already enthusiastically embraced the
standard (Balta, 1999). These include the Asia-Paciﬁc region, with Japan having over
25 percent of ISO 14001 registrations worldwide, and Europe. Indeed IBM, as a large
multinational company, has felt customer pressure for registration in these areas. One
international company for which IBM is a supplier gives points on their satisfaction
survey for having ISO 14001 registration. Indeed, many companies worldwide are
ﬁnding it advantageous to align their EMS with the standard and register as customer
needs require.

4.4 Commitment, orientation, culture and cost of ISO 14001 certiﬁcation
Issued in September 1996, ISO 14001 consists of ﬁve essential requirements (that are
based on traditional management principles) (Boiral and Sala, 1998):

17,1

78

(1) commitment and policy;
(2) planning;
(3)
(4) checking and corrective action; and
(5) management review and continual improvement.

implementation and operation;

The ﬁrst requirement necessitates the existence of a written environmental policy and
a corporate commitment to environmental improvement. Essentially, what this means
is that the company must conform to all applicable national laws and regulations, must
include pollution prevention as one of its policies, and must have a commitment
towards continuously improving environmental performance. The plan of action
indicates the “what”, the “how” and the “when” of environmental management.
Generally, this stage describes what the company is going to do, how it is going to go
about doing it, and when it is to be done. Central to the effective operation of the EMS is
employee involvement. Without it, the system may not bring signiﬁcant improvements
to the environment. As a consequence, the allocation of responsibility is a crucial
element of ISO 14001. The checking and corrective action elements of the system help
ensure continuous improvement by addressing root causes or non-conformances. It is
at this stage that the auditing aspects are pertinent. The ongoing management review
of the EMS and its elements help ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy and
effectiveness of the program. In addition, management review gives the system
credibility and reinforces its diligent operations. Thus, while an audit examines the
structure of the EMS and its component parts (ensuring that the requirements of ISO
14001 are in place), management review focuses on the EMS itself and its
interrelationship with the functioning of the company as a whole. These requirements
appear to be similar to Deming’s plan-do-check-act cycle (Graff, 1997; Corbett and
Kirsch, 2000).

Clearly the beneﬁts of ISO 14000 certiﬁcation are many: gaining market place and
shareholder advantages, insurance hedging, reduced costs, other ﬁnancial beneﬁts,
and achieving higher productivity. But how do the ISO 14000 standards assist ﬁrms?
There are a few underlying potential beneﬁts of the ISO 14001 certiﬁcation (D’Souza,
2004):

.

.

ISO 14000 helps ﬁrms to implement their commitment
to environmental
excellence, helps avoid multiple registrations, inspections, certiﬁcations, labels
and conﬂicting requirements, and removes the need for certain regulatory
“command and control” initiatives.
ISO 14000 should facilitate international trade and remove trade barriers. For
example, in Manila, large as well as small ﬁrms have been asked by the
government to comply to these standards in order to remain competitive.

. These systems can also assist companies in targeting green consumers. By
showing their support
for environmental protection issues through their
marketing of green products, organizations can pursue a distinctive way of
competing.

Firms in Brazil reported enhanced public image to be one of the greatest beneﬁts of ISO
14001 certiﬁcation. Evidence from Formosa Plastics Corp. in Livingstone, New Jersey,

also supported this contention (Corbett and Kirsch, 2000). In Japan, however, it was
found that only the ﬁrst ﬁrm to obtain certiﬁcation in a given industrial sector enjoyed
this beneﬁt. Other beneﬁts cited include increased market share (when customers seek
only ISO 14001 certiﬁed suppliers) and improved proﬁtability (through waste
reduction). Although various other companies reported having improved
competitiveness,
this was largely non-quantiﬁable (Corbett and Kirsch, 2000).
Additionally, ISO 14001 certiﬁcation also leads to improved customer satisfaction,
improved efﬁciency of operations and processes, improved community relations, cost
reduction, and improved risk management practices (Fielding, 1999; Petroni, 2001).
Other ISO 14001 certiﬁed companies reported increased compliance with complicated
regulations, more motivated employees, more transparent and effective organizations,
lower risk of liabilities, better allocation of responsibilities and better information ﬂow
of environmental matters (Steger, 2000).

The evidence just provided serves to support the contention that, indeed, an ISO
14001 EMS would enable a company to simultaneously improve its bottom line and its
environmental performance. The ﬁndings of Boiral and Sala (1998), however, seem
contrary to this assertion. They found that not all managers at Alcan Smelters and
Chemicals Ltd (AS&C) in the US believed that adopting the ISO 14000 standards would
improve environmental performance. Despite this, there has been an ever-increasing
number of companies getting certiﬁcation. In Malaysia, for example, as of 30 June 1999,
there were 101 certiﬁed sites. As of June 2001, the number had risen to 134, and it is still
increasing. Whether the increase is brought about by management wanting to convey
a favorable perception of environmental performance through site credentialism
(Taylor et al., 2001) (i.e. a public relations exercise) or out of a genuine concern for the
environment may be difﬁcult to determine. Both sets of motivations may well lead to
positive outcomes.

The decision to seek ISO 14001 certiﬁcation should be evaluated in the same
manner as any other business decisions (Corbett and Kirsch, 2000). Consequently,
cost-beneﬁt analysis has been a central issue examined in prior empirical work
(Steger, 2000). The cost of implementation (which includes the cost of training,
documentation, process modiﬁcation, registration fee, registration maintenance,
organizational adaptation and legal consequences) is generally dependent on the
size of the site and whether or not the company possesses prior experience with
the implementation of ISO 9000 standards on quality. Costs may range from
e50,000 to e100,000 (Steger, 2000). Graff (1997) puts the cost of putting in place an
ISO 14001 EMS as being between US$15,000 and US$150,000 per site. Rockwell
Automation spent about US$50,000 for each of its 44 ISO 14001 certiﬁed sites
(Moretz, 2000). According to Corbett and Kirsch (2000), obtaining ISO 14001
certiﬁcation is not a major resource-intensive undertaking. None of the companies
that participated in their study felt that the certiﬁcation process was excessively
expensive or onerous.

However, the data for a cost-beneﬁts analysis of an EMS are fragmented and
contradictory (Steger, 2000). In Steger’s (2000) review of empirical studies in Europe, he
found that there was no common deﬁnition of the elements that were included in the
“cost” of the EMS. While some companies included only the cash cost, others included
the follow up actions “triggered by a discovery” in the process of establishing the EMS.
Further, he argues that while costs may be immediate and measurable, the beneﬁts are


MEQ
17,1

80

difﬁcult to measure and determined. How does one measure positive (enhanced) image
of a company or increased motivation on the part of employees? This is primarily
because the potential beneﬁts are intangible. It is “impossible to tally unwritten
citations, ﬁnes not levied and lawsuits not ﬁled” (Hogarth, 1999, p. 123). Thus, the
advantages claimed, such as a positive public image or increased motivation on the
part of employees, are just perceived beneﬁts that are neither measurable nor
empirically veriﬁable. In line with this, prior research (e.g. Montabon et al., 2000)
examining the impact of ISO 14001 EMS on environmental and economic performance
has systematically sought respondents’ perceptions of the beneﬁts of ISO 14001. Our
study continues this trend by examining certiﬁed sites in Malaysia. On the
cost-beneﬁts issue, because of the inherent difﬁculties in determining the costs and
beneﬁts of implementing an ISO 14001 EMS, our study merely sought respondents’
perceptions as to whether or not they felt that the beneﬁts of ISO 14001 certiﬁcation
actually outweigh its costs (without actually asking them for the actual costs incurred
or asking for the quantum of the beneﬁts).

4.5 Theoretical framework
The dependent variable of the ability of a ﬁrm to improve its environmental and
economic performance through ISO 140001 certiﬁcation is inﬂuenced by four key
independent variables:

(1)
(2)

(3)

(4)

the commitment of management, especially managerial support;
the importance of culture factors (such as customer demand, society demand,
past experience of ISO 9000 and employee participation);
the importance of orientation factors (such as better waste management, quality
of the product and efﬁcient production); and
the implementation cost of ISO 14001.

4.6 Hypotheses

H1. There is a positive relationship between a ﬁrm’s commitment to ISO 14001

and its performance.

H2. There is a positive relationship between a ﬁrm’s orientation to ISO 14001 and

its performance.

H3. There is a positive relationship between a ﬁrm’s culture of ISO 14001 and its

performance.

H4. The implementation cost of ISO 14001 is well worth the expenditure of

resources, and is positively correlated with a ﬁrm’s performance

5. Methodology
The purpose of this study was to test hypotheses because we want to explain the
variance in the dependent variable (a ﬁrm’s performance in terms of economic and
environmental aspects) by establishing the nature of the relationship between the
dependent variable and the independent variables through the testing of
the
hypotheses as what proposed in section 2.6. This is a correlational study because
we are interested in delineating the important variables associated with the

effect a ﬁeld study (Sekaran, 2003).

The population of this study comprises all of the ISO 14001 certiﬁed companies
operating in Malaysia that are registered under the Federation of Malaysian
Manufacturers (FMM). The objective of this research study is to examine the impact of
the implementation of ISO 14001 EMSs on ﬁrms’ environmental and economic
performance in Malaysia. Here the unit of analysis is the individual ﬁrm. The study
looks at the data gathered from each ﬁrm and treats each response as an individual
data source. As the number of certiﬁed ﬁrms in Malaysia is small (only 159 sites in
2004), the choice of method has to be one that allows all of the ISO 14001 certiﬁed sites
to be surveyed. Since the certiﬁed sites are located all over Malaysia, a mail survey
seemed to be the most appropriate method. The use of a postal questionnaire survey as
a method of data collection has been very popular with researchers as it provides
numerous advantages. A survey enables the collection of a sufﬁciently large and
representative sample for analysis. Besides being simple, the postal questionnaire
survey method is cost-effective and enables respondents to preserve their anonymity.
Accordingly, this would make respondents feel more comfortable when answering the
questionnaire.

independent variables. This

The questionnaire consisted of three major sections. The ﬁrst section gathered
information about the various measurements of ﬁrms’ environmental management
systems based on four
section analyzed the
environmental management system and its traits by identifying 42 different
dimensions. These dimensions were classiﬁed according to the four independent
variables that are of interest to the study. The respondents were then asked to
assess their ﬁrm’s systems using a ﬁve-point scale (0 ¼ strongly disagree; 5 ¼
strongly agree). A ﬁve-point scale has been widely used in research studies, as
this Likert scale is designed to examine how strongly respondents agree or
disagree with statements in questionnaire. The second section of the questionnaire
dealt with the perceived impact of the ISO 140001 certiﬁcation process on ﬁrms’
performance and their competitive position in the marketplace. The respondents
were asked to evaluate the impact of their environmental management system on
14 dimensions of performance. Some of these dimensions focused on the core
strategic areas of competition (cost, lead time, cost and market position). Others
touched on areas such as reputation and customer acceptance. Still others dealt
with issues of process/product design and cost/beneﬁt assessment. Similar to
section I of the questionnaire, the respondents were asked to assess the impact of
their environmental management system using a ﬁve-point scale (0 ¼ strongly
disagree; 5 ¼ strongly agree). Section III of
the questionnaire focused on the
demographics of respondents, including job position, years in service, the number
of employees in the company, the percentage of manufactured products exported,
the status of the company, and the industry type of the company.

Questionnaires were sent to all 159 certiﬁed sites (as of 2004) in Malaysia. A list of
ISO 14001 certiﬁed sites was obtained from the Directory of Malaysian Industries 2004
(Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers, 2004). Our questionnaire on the impact of ISO

14001 EMS on various dimensions of performance was adapted from Montabon et al.’s
(2000) study.

5.1 Findings
A total of 151 mailings were sent out to certiﬁed ﬁrms throughout the nation. Earlier,
159 ﬁrms were identiﬁed in the study; however, after considering that a few of these
are located at the same place and under the same large organization, only 151
questionnaires were sent out. Altogether, 45 sites responded to the survey, giving a
response rate of 29.8 percent, a relatively high percentage for studies conducted in
Malaysia. The respondents represented a variety of positions and functions including,
environmental managers, quality managers, executive managers, HR managers, safety
and training managers, environmental, safety and health (ESH) managers and others,
“others” in this case including a HSE coordinator, an environmental engineer, a quality
engineer, etc. Respondents were asked to indicate their job titles. They occupy
positions ranging from executive managers to environmental engineers/coordinators
and staff. This diversity argues strongly in favor of the generalizability of the results.
Environmental management represented a very major portion of the respondents (18
respondents or 40.0 percent). This indicates that the survey consists primarily of users
who should be able to assess ERMs and ISO 14000 as business/strategic decisions.
Again, this is consistent with the objectives of this study.

A large majority (37.8 percent) of the respondents are involved in the manufacture
of semiconductors and electrical goods. Of the 45 sites that responded, 30 (66.7 percent)
are wholly owned by foreign companies. Of these, the majority are afﬁliated to
Japanese companies. Only six sites belong to wholly local owned companies. The low
percentage of wholly local owned companies that are ISO 14001 certiﬁed may be an
interesting issue to explore, but is not pursued here. Another interesting trend is that
the longer ﬁrms have been operating in Malaysia, the higher is the tendency for them
to achieve ISO 14001 certiﬁcation. Those have been operating for more than 20 years
represent 35.6 percent of companies who responded.

5.2 Descriptive statistics
Montabon et al. (2000), in their survey of purchasing managers in the US, found strong
evidence that certiﬁcation impacts positively on performance, both environmental and
economic. As can be observed from Table I (after converting the responses to means
and subsequently ranking the means), enhancing the reputation of the company ranks
ﬁrst with a mean of 4.27 out of a possible 5 on the Likert scale. The low standard
deviation indicates a general consensus amongst the respondents. Improving the
company’s chances of selling products internationally comes a close second, with a
mean of 4.07.

Waste reduction was ranked third, with a mean of 3.98. This seems to support
Rondinelli and Vastag’s (2000) contention that ISO 14001 certiﬁcation is not a
meaningless label. Indeed, ISO 14001 certiﬁed Malaysian companies surveyed do
perceive that waste is reduced, thus indicating that certiﬁcation actually leads to
environmental
improvement and may eventually lead to increased proﬁtability
(Corbett and Kirsch, 2000). Increase customer satisfaction level and improving the
company’s competitive position, rank fourth and ﬁfth respectively. Although these
factors are neither quantiﬁable nor measurable, the results here provide an indication

that respondents do perceive there are beneﬁts to certiﬁcation. However, ISO 14001
certiﬁcation has not signiﬁcantly reduced lead times (ranked last with a mean of 3.24),
or reduced overall costs (mean ¼ 3:42; ranked 13). Our results seemed to mirror those
of Montabon et al. (2000). They too found that ISO 14001 certiﬁcation has very little
impact on these measures of performance.

5.3 Inter-correlations among the study variables
Abbreviations were developed as summarized below:

COM_A

management commitment;

COM_B

performance tracking;

COM_A

product acceptability;

ORT_A

documentation orientation;

ORT_B

environmental management;

CUL_A

process design culture;

CUL_B

supplier demand culture;

CUL_C

past experience of ISO 9000;

COS_A

cost of implementation;

IMP_A

perceived economic/environmental impact;

IMP_B

IMP_C

perceived customer satisfaction; and

perceived market position.

Table I presents the intercorrelations and Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients of all 12 factors
that were derived from factor analysis. Pearson product-moment correlation was
applied to investigate the intercorrelation among all study variables to be used in the
hypothesis testing. Due to the fact that there is only one item each for COM_B and
COM_C, reliability analysis cannot proceed for these two factors and Cronbach’s alpha
coefﬁcient is not applicable for either factor. From reliability analysis, all Cronbach’s
alpha coefﬁcients values are greater 0.60. This indicates that all items for each factor
are reliable and that their internal consistency is high. The exception is CUL_C, which
only achieved a value of 0.55. Although this value is low, it is still acceptable.

From bivariate correlation analysis, all dependent variables for IMP_A were
signiﬁcantly intercorrelated at either p , 0:01 or p , 0:05, except for CUL_C. Their
intercorrelations ranged from 0.25 to 0.75. All had a positive Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient. Similarly, IMP_B was signiﬁcantly intercorrelated with all dependent and
independent variables. All were signiﬁcantly intercorrelated at p , 0:01, except for
COM_B and COM_C at p , 0:05. Again, all had positive Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcients in this dependent variable. For IMP_C, it was signiﬁcantly intercorrelated
with all dependent and independent variables except for COM_A, COM_B, COM_C
and CUL_C. Their intercorrelations ranged from 0.14 to 0.49. All COM_A, COM_B and
COM_C showed an insigniﬁcant intercorrelation coefﬁcient with their independent
variables. This is understandable for both COM_B and COM_C because they have only

one item for each. Another interesting point to note was that all independent and
dependent variables were positively correlated to each other; none of them had a
negative Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.

5.4 Test for Hypothesis 1
Hypothesis 1 suggested that all dimensions of commitment to ISO 14001 were
positively related to a ﬁrm’s performance. All components of COM_A, COM_B and
COM_C were entered as step 2, and regressed with each dimension of IMP_A, IMP_B
and IMP_C. From Table II it can be seen that COM_A was related signiﬁcantly to
(b¼ 0:402, p , 0:01) and perceived
perceived economic/environmental
customer satisfaction (b¼ 0:330, p , 0:05), whereas COM_B was signiﬁcantly
related to perceived customer satisfaction and COM_C had no signiﬁcant effect on the
performance of any of the ﬁrms. As there were three dimensions of ﬁrms’ performance
that evaluated with three dimensions of commitment, therefore three sub-hypotheses
were framed for this Hypothesis 1. In short, Hypotheses 1a and 1b were partially
supported, whereas Hypothesis 1c was not supported, as COM_C has no signiﬁcant
effect on the performance of any of the ﬁrms.

impact

As shown in Table II, the R 2 value is 0.325. This means that 32.5 percent of the
variation in perceived economic/environmental impact is explained by the combination
of the three independent variables, while 77.5 percent remains unexplained. The
histogram of the residuals for IMP_A and IMP_B is bell-shaped, leading us to believe
that the error is normally distributed. The normal p-p plot shows that the values fall
along the diagonal with no extreme substantial or systematic departures; hence, the
residuals are considered to represent a normal distribution. In contrast, the histogram
of the residuals for perceived market position is skewed to the right-hand side, leading
us to believe that the error is not normally distributed. The normal p-p plot shows that
some of the values do not fall along the diagonal, with some extreme substantial or
systematic departures; hence, the residuals are considered to represent a skewed
distribution.

5.5 Test for Hypothesis 2
In Hypothesis 2, it was postulated that ﬁrms going for ISO 14001 certiﬁcation will
increase their performance due to a better orientation of ISO 14001 practices. Thus,

components of ORT_A and ORT_B were entered in step two, and subsequently
regressed with all dimensions of ﬁrms’ performance. The results of the regression
analysis for perceived customer satisfaction are shown in Table III. It was found that
ORT_A was not signiﬁcantly related to perceived customer satisfaction and perceived
market position, whereas ORT_B was not signiﬁcantly related to perceived customer
satisfaction. Thus, all three sub-hypotheses were partially supported.

5.6 Test for Hypothesis 3
The third hypothesis of this research postulated that ﬁrms going for ISO 14001
certiﬁcation would improve their performance due to better culture practices. To test
this impact, CUL_A, CUL_B and CUL_C were entered in step two (after entering the
control variables) and then regressed with IMP_A, IMP_B and IMP_C, respectively. A
summary of the interaction results is shown in Table IV. As can be seen, Table IV
indicates that only CUL_A has a signiﬁcant effect
related to perceived
economic/environmental
impact, and CUL_B has a signiﬁcant effect related to
perceived customer satisfaction. Thus, Hypotheses 3a and 3b were partially supported,
whereas Hypothesis 3c was not supported.

5.7 Test for Hypothesis 4
Hypothesis 4 suggested that the implementation cost of ISO 14001 is well worth the
expenditure of resources, and is positively correlated to ﬁrms’ performance. In the
same way, three demographic variables were entered as control variables, followed by
COS_A, the implementation cost of ISO 14001, in step two. Subsequently, they were
regressed with each dimension of IMP_A, IMP_B and IMP_C. A summary of the
multiple regression results is shown in Table V. The summary result showed that all
COS_A has a high impact on three factors of ﬁrms’ performance. Thus, it is concluded
that implementation cost of ISO 14001 is well worth the expenditure as it impacts
positively on ﬁrms’ performance. As a result, Hypothesis 4 is fully supported.

A summary of the results of the hypotheses tests is shown in Table VI.

6. Discussion
This study is intended to investigate the relationship of management commitment,
orientation of EMS, culture of EMS, cost of EMS implementation with respect to ﬁrms’
performance. The objective of the research is to investigate what economic and
environmental impacts EMS certiﬁcation has had on ﬁrms’ performance. Additionally,
we sought to examine the beneﬁts of adopting the ISO 14001 standard, and to ascertain
whether the beneﬁts of EMS certiﬁcation actually outweigh its implementation cost.
The study found that successful attainment of ISO 14000 has a large, positive impact
on the perceived efﬁciency and effectiveness of the EMS. Except for production
efﬁciency and quality of products, which are not supported from hypothesis testing,
ISO 14000 greatly improves every dimension of performance. This ﬁnding points to a
situation where those ﬁrms that have attained this level of certiﬁcation are not only
more environmentally responsible but also more efﬁcient (and potentially better
suppliers).

Our study examined the impact of ISO 14001 on the economic and environmental
performance of certiﬁed ﬁrms in Malaysia. Our results seem to mirror those of other
studies conducted in developed countries. Speciﬁcally, the study found that ISO 14001
certiﬁcation is perceived to have a positive impact on both economic and
environmental performance. The sites surveyed reported enhanced company
reputation as well as signiﬁcant waste reduction at their plants. Thus, the argument
put forth by some critics that ISO 14001 is merely a formality or an empty label that
has no other beneﬁts apart from image building and public relations is not supported
by the results of our study. Further, respondents felt that putting an ISO 14001 EMS in

place has led them to explore alternative technologies and procedures in their
production processes. They also perceived that the beneﬁts of certiﬁcation far
outweighed its costs. While all these seem to speak well for ISO 14001, our ﬁndings
also revealed some negative aspects. Instituting an ISO 14001 EMS did not help
management reduce lead times or costs or lead to quality improvements. Additionally,
to improve the quality of our environment there needs to be a partnership between
government, businesses and the community. Most importantly, there should be a
fundamental change in attitude to ensure better environmental performance. In other
words, one needs to personalize one’s approach to the environment (Avila and
Whitehead, 1993).

The relationship between environmental systems, economic/environmental
performance and overall ﬁrm performance is not clear. Some writers, such as Porter
and Van der Linde (1995), have argued that by becoming more environmentally
responsible, ﬁrms also uncover new sources of waste and productivity. The result is
that enhanced environmental
responsibility results in improved corporate
performance. Other writers, primarily Walley and Whitehead (1994), argue that this
is not the case. In most instances, improved environmental performance comes at the

cost of reduced proﬁtability and reduced shareholder value. One-way of evaluating the
nature of this relationship is to ask respondents to assess the impact of their
environmental management systems on several critical dimensions of their ﬁrms’
performance. To this end, a section was included that focused on this speciﬁc aspect of
performance. The respondents were asked to evaluate the impact of
their
environmental management systems on 14 dimensions of performance. Some of
these dimensions focused on the core strategic areas of competition (cost, lead-time,
and market position). Others touched on areas such as reputation and customer
acceptance. Still others dealt with issues of process/product design and cost/beneﬁt
assessment.

As can be seen from descriptive analysis, the study observed high standard
deviations associated with the means: there is a fair degree of difference in the
positions taken. However, a study of the mean responses reveals a mixed picture of the
impact of an EMS on overall ﬁrm performance. At best, environmental systems have
caused managers to explore more options when dealing with problems, especially
problems involving new technologies and procedures. Further, these systems have not
compromised product acceptance and corporate position in the marketplace. However,
these systems have not helped management to reduce lead-times, improve quality, or
reduce costs – the primary factors that shape a ﬁrm’s competitive position in the
marketplace. Lastly,
it is important to point out that unless management and
employees believe in the certiﬁcation process, the chances of success may be slim. A
target of zero emissions creates a distinct corporate culture and a policy focus that will
guarantee environmental
improvement (Clark, 1999). However, this may not be
achieved without the commitment of top management. A major effort in identifying,
measuring and reporting environmental impacts begins with the CEO (Epstein and
Roy, 1998).

Governments, too, have an important role to play. To support an enhanced level of
environmental proactivity, governments should provide for regulatory incentives.
Essentially, the way governments set policy and impose taxes should help efforts
towards the greening of the environment. For example, support from governments in
the form of grants (particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises) to gain
certiﬁcation will contribute towards an improved environment. In Taiwan, the
Industrial Development Bureau contributes between 40 and 60 percent of ISO 14001
preparation costs for about 50 SMEs annually (Corbett and Kirsch, 2000). Another is
through the provision of tax relief (“green tax”) given to companies that are ISO 14001
certiﬁed. Providing incentives for companies to implement EMS voluntarily is
relevant. It has been claimed that providing tax relief would be the most powerful tool
in encouraging companies to be environmentally responsible (Steger, 2000). In
Malaysia, for example, the government provides incentives in the form of subsidies for
using unleaded petrol and natural gas. While the “green tax” acts as a positive
reinforcement, countries worldwide have also resorted to the punitive method of
ensuring that companies act responsibly towards the environment. With the increase
in the amount of legislation pertaining to the environment and hefty increases in ﬁnes
for violators,
it is hoped that there will be an improvement in environmental
performance. Most importantly, enterprises must realize that being environmentally
responsible pays.

7. Future research
Further, while the empirical results may be interesting, the ﬁndings represent an
exploratory area of research, which ultimately needs to be grounded in theory. To this
end, DiMaggio and Powell’s (1983)
institutional theory may provide an ex post
explanation of the results obtained here. According to this theory, pressures exerted on
organizations by other organizations upon which they are dependent may have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the manner in which corporations act. For example, the study
found that the ﬁrms surveyed indicated that a speciﬁc directive from headquarters
brought about
thus supporting the theory of coercive
isomorphism. This was evidenced by the fact that most respondents were wholly
owned foreign companies, with the majority being in Japanese, US or UK ownership.
Additionally, the incentive to seek certiﬁcation can, to some extent, be explained by
legitimacy theory. Legitimacy theory postulates that an implicit agreement exists
between society and organizations, under which the latter are allowed to continue
operations as long as they are seen to satisfy speciﬁc societal needs (Deegan and
Gordon, 1997).

ISO 14001 certiﬁcation,

From a legitimacy theory perspective, the results in Table IV may be interpreted as
supporting the notion that ISO 14001 certiﬁcation is primarily driven by a need to
maintain the public perception of good environmental management. Finally, prior
research has consistently found that a strong environmental performer is also one that
has a strong bottom line (Lovins et al., 1999). In line with this, stakeholder theory may
also help illuminate the relationship between corporate environmental performance
and economic performance. From the perspective of stakeholder theory, a company is
implied to have contracts with multiple stakeholders. A tenet of the theory asserts that
shareholders (deemed the dominant stakeholder group) will beneﬁt ﬁnancially when
management meets the demands of multiple stakeholders. To this end, and in the
context of EMS, separating self-interest and environmental responsiveness may prove
difﬁcult as both sets of motivations can lead to positive outcomes for both the
stakeholders and the ﬁrm (see Ruf et al., 2001). Future research on EMS should
incorporate the theories just mentioned so that a more comprehensive theoretical
framework can be developed.

8. Conclusion
Overall, this study has provided some empirical evidence that ISO 14001 certiﬁcation
has a positive impact on ﬁrms’ performance, speciﬁcally on perceived economic
impact, perceived environmental impact and perceived customer satisfaction. One very
important element of ISO 14001 is that the EMS must continually improve. In essence,
the standard requires sound environmental management to be a way of travelling, and
not a destination. ISO 14001 adds value to an EMS, even a mature one, as a continual
improvement activity. Although ISO 14001 is not
the only way to manage
environmental affairs effectively, and registration to ISO 14001 does not itself
guarantee outstanding business results, our study has shown that it has in fact had a
strong impact on and provided beneﬁts for the overall position of the company.

By failing to perceive a marketing opportunity from using this well-known
standard, ﬁrms can lose their market share. In addition, consumers should be made
aware of these programs, especially in the case of environmental labels. These labels
should be placed where they are visible to the consumer in order to inﬂuence purchase


decisions. Firms should want to participate voluntarily in the certiﬁcation process
mainly to be able to appeal to this segment of consumers. While the success of this
program brings many beneﬁts, both environmentally and economically, that success
will depend on how much a ﬁrm is willing to invest in time and resources. Like all good
investments, if cultivated well, it may be suggested that the ISO 14000 standards can
garner substantial dividends in the long run.
