Recent
level of
philanthropic donations made by large U.K. busi-
nesses has grown signiﬁcantly over the last 20 years
(Arulampalam and Stoneman, 1995; Campbell et al.,
2002). The most recent statistics indicate that the
largest 100 U.K. ﬁrms collectively contributed over
£630 M in 2002/3, a rise of 26% on the previous year,
and that the proportion of proﬁts given to charities by
these companies approximately doubled between
2001 and 2003.1 The increasing importance of cor-
porate philanthropy is reﬂected in the proliferation of
recent articles in the academic literature, many of
which chart the chronological development of cor-
porate philanthropy in the United States or the United
Kingdom or examine the correlates of philanthropy
(Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Arulampalam and

A variety of motivations for ﬁrms making phil-
anthropic donations have been advanced in the
existing literature (see Siefert et al., 2003, pp. 195–
196 for a useful overview). Among these alternative
motivations, a central path paints philanthropy both
as a way for companies to demonstrate their social
responsiveness to the communities in which they
operate (Berman et al., 1999; Wood and Jones,
1995), and as an activity that stimulates goodwill
towards companies within those communities. Ear-
lier work has argued that corporate philanthropy
inﬂuences the perceptions of the ﬁrm in the eyes of a
including investors2, cus-
variety of
tomers3, suppliers, actual or potential employees,
and the voluntary sector (Himmelstein, 1997; Saiia,
et al., 2003; Smith, 1994). Philanthropic donations
may, therefore, serve both the needs of communi-
ties, and enhance the long-run ﬁnancial performance
of the ﬁrm.

stakeholders

Corporate reputation, the collective opinion of an
organization held by its
stakeholders, has been
identiﬁed as a construct of growing importance
(Kitchen and Laurence, 2003; MacMillan et al.,
2002). Among other factors, reputation has been
identiﬁed as playing a signiﬁcant role in improving
ﬁrm value (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Gregory,
1991), enhancing consumer perceptions of product
quality (Grewal et al., 1998; Milgrom and Roberts,
1986), raising employee morale, productivity and
improving recruitment and retention (Garbett, 1988;
Gregory, 1991; Turban and Cable, 2003), and per-
mitting access to cheaper capital (Beatty and Ritter,
1986). The existing literature has identiﬁed a close
relationship between corporate reputational capital
and social responsibility (e.g. Fryxell and Wang,
1994; McGuire et al., 1988) and has focused con-
siderable attention on evaluating the meaning of
reputational
ranking chief
among them) concluding that such indices ‘‘speak
most directly to their ‘‘reputation’’ as an investment’’
(Fryxell and Wang, 1994, p. 13).

In spite of the apparently strong orientation of
commonly available metrics of corporate reputation
towards the ﬁnancial performance of organizations, a
small, but developing body of work has sought to
understand the relationship between social respon-
siveness and corporate reputation thus deﬁned.

positive link between philanthropy and ﬁrm repu-
tation. In addition, Williams and Barrett ﬁnd evi-
dence that
the link between philanthropy and
reputation is stronger among companies that more
frequently violate occupational health and safety and
regulations, arguing that, among

(Williams and Barrett, 2000, p. 348). Notably, nei-
ther Fombrun and Shanley (1990) nor Williams and
Barrett (2000) permit the effect of philanthropy on
ﬁrm reputation to vary across industries.

‘‘charitable giving appears

This paper contributes to the developing stream
of research that focuses on the relationship between
corporate reputation and social philanthropy. Con-
tributions from the social issues in management ﬁeld
have argued that social responsiveness is a funda-
mentally multidimensional construct that embodies a
large and varied range of corporate behaviour in
relation to its
resources, processes and outputs
(Carroll, 1979; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Wood,
1991). In the context of philanthropy, earlier work
has primarily focused on the importance of cash
giving by ﬁrms
(Adams and Hardwick, 1998;
Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Navarro, 1988) but
some work has begun to examine the signiﬁcance of
both other forms of corporate resources and cor-
porate policies concerning philanthropy (Brammer
and Millington, 2003). Brammer and Millington
(2003) highlight the signiﬁcant degree of variation
across organizations in the existence and nature of
policies that govern the distribution of philanthropic
expenditures across
stakeholder groups. As yet,
empirical work has not examined the link between
philanthropic expenditures and policies and corpo-
rate reputation in any detail. Speciﬁcally, earlier
studies have failed to account for the possible impacts
of the diversity of community involvement policy in
addition to the impact of the size of expenditures.

This paper makes three contributions to the lit-
erature. First, the analysis is the ﬁrst to distinguish
level of philanthropic
between the impact of

expenditures and corporate policies concerning the
focus of their philanthropic initiatives on corporate
reputation. Given that policies offer some indication
of the destination of philanthropic expenditures, the
analysis investigates whether how ﬁrms manage their
philanthropy affects their reputations. Second,
in
contrast to earlier studies, the analysis permits the
impact of philanthropy upon reputation to vary
across industries. Philanthropy is expected to have
different impacts on reputation according to how
closely it is linked to the social consequences of
individual ﬁrms. Our analysis investigates whether
philanthropy has a more signiﬁcant impact on the
reputations of some ﬁrms than others. Third, the
evidence presented is among the ﬁrst evidence
concerning the drivers of corporate reputations in
the U.K. context. Much of the existing literature in
the reputation ﬁeld is U.S.-based, as are the only
existing studies of the link between reputation and
social performance; our study sheds some light on
the extent to which regularities observed there are
internationally robust.

The paper is structured as follows. The next
section discusses the determinants of ﬁrm reputation,
paying particular attention to philanthropy and
philanthropic policies. Section ‘‘Method’’ introduces
the sample and data sources. Section ‘‘Results’’ re-
ports the results of the empirical analysis before a
ﬁnal section concludes.

The determinants of corporate reputation

In this section we develop a model of the inﬂuences
on corporate reputation and outline a number of
hypotheses. Our starting point
is Fombrun and
Shanley’s seminal model which hypothesises that
corporate reputations ‘‘represent publics’ cumulative
judgements of ﬁrms over time’’ which,
in turn,
hinge on ‘‘relative success in fulﬁlling the expecta-
tions of multiple stakeholders’’
(Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990, p. 235). Stakeholders are expected to
have diverse preferences over ﬁrm actions, process
and outcomes, and these ‘‘different publics attend to
different features of ﬁrm’s performance’’ (Fombrun
and Shanley, 1990, p. 235). From this it follows that
a ﬁrm’s current reputation is related to the signals
that publics have received, whether directly from the
ﬁrm or via other information channels such as the

media or stock markets, concerning its behaviours,
and the congruence between ﬁrm behaviours and
the preferences of
(Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990).

those publics

Following Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we dif-
ferentiate between various types of signals that rel-
evant publics may receive concerning companies,
and which may inﬂuence their perceptions of the
ﬁrm. Such signals vary according to whether they
originate within or outside the company and with
respect to the type of information they contain. Our
framework hypothesises that ﬁrm reputation in the
eyes of stakeholders is related to signals concerning
philanthropic activities, and to signals relating to
ﬁnancial performance, ownership and board com-
position, size, media visibility, and industry. We will
discuss each of these in turn.

Reputation and philanthropy

Existing work has argued that social responsiveness
can play a signiﬁcant role in promoting favourable
relationships with primary stakeholder groups upon
whom ‘‘the survival and continuing prosperity of the
organization depends’’ (Clarkson, 1995, p. 107).
Hillman and Keim (2001) argue that effective
stakeholder management can create ‘‘intangible,
socially complex resources that may enhance ﬁrms’
ability to outperform competitors in terms of long-
term value creation’’ (Hillman and Keim, 2001, p.
127) and highlight communities as a key member of
the group of primary stakeholders. Consistent with
these views, a growing literature argues that phi-
lanthropy plays a signiﬁcant role in establishing and
developing favourable relationships with community
stakeholders (Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Berman
et al., 1999; Wood and Jones, 1995). The strength of
the signal that such philanthropic activities send to
stakeholders may be expected to have become
stronger recently in the U.K., where increasingly
detailed information concerning the philanthropic
activities of
leading companies has been made
available through the national news media and
through the publications of socially oriented pressure
groups such as the PerCent Club and Business in the
Community. The Guardian began publishing its

is of primary importance when
attempting to design organizational responses
to
them. Therefore, the reputational impact of phi-
lanthropy may be expected to vary according to
whether it is focused upon activities that are broadly
congruent with the expectations and preferences of
social stakeholders or not. Brammer and Millington
(2003) highlight
that are
expected to play a role in shaping philanthropic
activities of companies in the U.K. First, participa-
tion in organized political and democratic activities
has declined as evidenced by the decline in the level
of electoral
turnouts and the low the levels of
membership of political parties by historical and
international standards (Mair and van Biezen, 2001).
Second, the signiﬁcant decline in recent decades in
churchgoing, particularly among Christian churches.
The Church of England has suffered a 27% fall in
membership since 1980. A MORI poll in April 2000
reported that 50% of those interviewed never went
to churches except for weddings and funerals and
only 16% of those surveyed attended church at least
once a fortnight. The decline in the importance of
religion is particularly marked among the young,
with only 54% of 18–24-year-old believing that
Jesus actually lived compared to 80% of the over 65s.
Third,
the signiﬁcant growth in the perceived
importance of social issues, particularly education,
within society as evidenced by the growth in the
proportion of opinion poll respondents highlighting
education as one of the most signiﬁcant issues facing
Britain from around 15% in 1990 to over 30% by
2000 (in fact, the proportion was as high as 49%
around the time of the 1997 general election). These
developments in social beliefs and preferences are
expected to have conditioned the link between
philanthropic expenditures and ﬁrm reputation such

that the link is more strongly positive if ﬁrm phi-
lanthropy programmes are consistent with these
preferences in that they exclude political and reli-
gious causes and prioritise educational causes.

from external

Recent contributions have argued that in addi-
tion to the, more usual, focus on pressure for social
responsiveness
stakeholder groups
such as pressure groups and consumers, ﬁrms also
face very considerable pressure from employee
stakeholders concerning their CSR (Smith, 2003;
Waddock et al., 2002). Recent
survey evidence
suggests that employees prefer to work for socially
responsive organizations, and are more likely to be
loyal
In response to these pressures,
organizations have developed a range of mecha-
nisms by which they involve their employees in
their social responsibility initiatives. Several of the
most common of these concern corporate philan-
thropy,
including the operation of schemes that
facilitate charitable giving by employees out of their
salaries,
the matching of such individual philan-
thropic activities by companies, and support
for
employee volunteering. These initiatives are ex-
pected to be positively related to ﬁrm reputation

Based on these discussions, we hypothesise that:

preferences have better reputations.

Industry environments vary according to the nature
of salient social responsibility issues and, therefore, in
terms of the expected corporate responses to those
issues. For example, earlier empirical work has
identiﬁed a number of sectors as having high envi-
ronmental impacts, e.g. the metals, resources, paper
and pulp, power generation, water, and chemicals
sectors (Bowen, 2000; Clemens, 2001; Hoffman,
1999; Morris, 1997; Sharma, 1997; Sharma et al.,


Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy

In contrast, other

industries, particularly
1999).
newer manufacturing industries and the service
sector have signiﬁcantly lower environmental im-
pacts and are associated with fewer highly visible
environmental issues. Other industries are associated
with alternative issues, for example, the tobacco and
alcoholic drinks industries are associated with highly
visible social issues. They are thought to produce
large social externalities (e.g. crime and health) and
are subject to strong regulatory regimes (competi-
tion, safety and taxation). Similarly, the defence and
pharmaceutical industries are subject to considerable
pressure from ethical pressure groups and the proﬁle
of workplace health and safety concerns is higher in
the construction and resource extraction sectors.

We propose that the perceived relatedness between
philanthropy and the prevailing responsibility issues in
a ﬁrm’s industry conditions the relationship between
philanthropy and reputation. Philanthropy should
arguably have a lower impact on ﬁrm reputation in
industries with signiﬁcant environmental
impacts
because it fails to address the primary concerns of
stakeholder groups (i.e. to reduce environmental
impacts). For this reason, it may also be that, in these
industries, philanthropy is viewed as a waste of cor-
porate resources, thus incurring the displeasure of
ﬁnancial, as well as societal, stakeholders. In other
industries, philanthropy can be seen to bear a much
more direct relationship to the social externalities
generated by businesses. Funding alcohol awareness
programmes, drug rehabilitation schemes, and other
community initiatives is more likely to be interpreted
by stakeholders as a direct form of atonement for the
harmful side-effects involved in their commercial
activities. For ﬁrms in these industries, philanthropy is
signiﬁcantly more likely to provide a reputational
payoff. Therefore we hypothesise that

such signals arise out of accounting data or stem from
movements in stock prices (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990). Strong ﬁnancial performance may be inter-
preted by external agents as a signal of effective
corporate strategy, good management, and good
resource allocations, and is therefore expected to
help a ﬁrm establish or maintain a good reputation
particularly among groups of ﬁnancial stakeholders
such as creditors, investors, and external analysts that
make use of such data (Fama, 1970; Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990). In addition, the impressions, assess-
ments and reports of
these, comparatively well
informed stakeholders, are expected to inﬂuence the
perceptions of companies in the eyes of other groups
of stakeholders (Shrum and Wuthnow, 1988). Fur-
thermore, since many of the important inﬂuences on
reputation are embedded within the ﬁrm (Dowling,
2001), external agents may ‘‘rely on previous
ﬁnancial performance outcomes as signals of a ﬁrm’s
overall esteem’’ (Roberts and Dowling, 2002, p.
1079). This
that ﬁnancial performance
attributes may play both direct and indirect roles in
inﬂuencing the perceptions of a variety of agents
concerning ﬁrm reputations. Consistent with this
view, an extensive empirical literature ﬁnds evidence
of a positive association between reputation and
ﬁnancial performance characteristics, although the
direction of causality appears to be ambiguous (see
Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Sabate and Puente,
2003). While external agents view ﬁnancially suc-
cessful companies favourably, they tend to be risk-
averse and therefore of two ﬁrms exhibiting similar
levels of ﬁnancial performance, it should be the ﬁrm
that appears to offer less risk that gains the better
reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Such
market risks may be linked to industry and may be
related to corporate leverage since more indebted
companies may face higher levels of

Ownership characteristics, board composition, and
reputation

Recent evidence suggests that ownership exerts a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on a diverse range of phenomena
including impacts on ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance
(Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Thomsen and Pedersen,
2000), strategic decisions concerning internationali-
zation and diversiﬁcation (Tihanyi et al., 2003), ﬁrm
R&D and innovation (Bushee, 1998; David et al.,
2001), CEO compensation (David et al., 1998), and
their
inﬂuence on corporate social performance
(Graves and Waddock, 1994; Johnson and Greening,
1999). Institutional investors have been motivated to
become more engaged with corporate management
because of their increased visibility and because they
are ‘‘tied in’’ to their investments in the sense that,
given their size, they have reduced ﬂexibility sell
investments without
signiﬁcantly damaging their
value (Ryan and Schneider, 2002). If this is the case,
the dissatisﬁed institutional investor has an incentive
to seek modiﬁcation of corporate strategy (rather than
sell-up), and management has an incentive to give
such a request due heed. Thus, it is avoidance of a
mutually damaging outcome, the drop in share price,
that grants institutions a position of inﬂuence. The
presence of signiﬁcant institutional shareholdings may
therefore send a strong signal to other stakeholders
that poor corporate performance will not be toler-
ated. This may, in turn, lead to a positive relationship
between the extent of such ownership and ﬁrm
reputation that arises both out of the positive inﬂu-
ence of shareholder activism on ﬁrm performance and
through the indirect mechanism of this signal inﬂu-
encing the perceptions of other stakeholders.

Board composition is also thought to play a key
through the
role in affecting ﬁrm behaviour
introduction of
increased diversity and via the
import of agents who are more strongly aligned
with external stakeholder interests than managers
(Wang and Dewhirst, 1992; Zahra et al., 1993).
The presence of outside directors may provide
‘additional windows on the world’ (Tricker, 1984,

p. 171). Their role is to inform and advise execu-
tive decision-makers, drawing upon specialist
knowledge and/or experience. If this input con-
tributes to the effectiveness of corporate strategy, as
it is designed to, then it may also augment the
company’s reputation.

Hypothesis 8

The greater is the degree of long-term institutional
ownership, the better is a firm’s reputation.

Hypothesis 9

The more non-executive directors as firm has, the
better its reputation.

Firm size, media visibility and reputation

the
Broadly speaking, ﬁrms grow as a result of
effectiveness of their corporate strategy, and so larger
ﬁrms should be expected to have better reputations
than smaller rivals because size is one measure of
success. It is also relevant here that larger ﬁrms tend
to be more visible to external agents. The larger scale
of their activities makes more numerous and signif-
icant their interactions with relevant external pub-
lics. Thus, agents will tend to hold more information
regarding the activities of larger ﬁrms, an imbalance
which may bias their assessments of corporate rep-
utation.

The media acts as an agenda-setter, and not
merely a mediator,
in the relationship between
companies and their stakeholders (Adler and Milne,
1997; Brown and Deegan, 1998). Media coverage
‘‘inﬂuences the preferences of
the populace and
helps set the public agenda’’ (Erﬂe and McMillan,
1990, p. 123). Organizational visibility affects per-
ceptions of organizations both by the provision of
information on speciﬁc issues and by introducing
availability biases whereby ‘‘ﬁrms frequently and
non-negatively touted by the media might therefore
develop better reputations’’ (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990, p. 240). Thus, media exposure increases the
stock of available information, and also sets the
context within which it is viewed. For both reasons,
one should expect the extent of media exposure to
inﬂuence assessments of corporate reputation.

The main data constraint
the
availability of data relating to corporate reputations.
To measure corporate reputation we utilise the
‘‘Britain’s most admired companies’’ survey from
Management Today, 2002. The Management Today
reputational survey is very similar methodologically
to the Fortune data often analysed in empirical work
concerning corporate reputations. The chairmen,
managing directors and selected main board directors
of the 10 largest companies in 24 industrial sectors
were surveyed, as were analysts at a selection of
leading investment companies. Participants were
asked to rate each company in their sector (exclud-
ing their own company) on a scale of zero (poor) to
10 (excellent) for their performance in nine criteria:
quality of management; ﬁnancial soundness; ability
to attract, develop and retain top talent; quality of
products/services; value as a long term investment;
capacity to innovate; quality of marketing; com-
munity and environmental responsibility; use of

corporate assets. The assessments received for each
ﬁrm were averaged across criteria and respondents to
produce a single reputational score.

This provides a reputational score (REPSCORE)
for each of 240 U.K. PLCs. It should be noted that,
because of the method employed in the construction
of reputational data, these companies, while drawn
from a wide range of
industrial sectors, are not
necessarily representative of the general run of eco-
nomic activity in the U.K. In addition, the focus is
clearly upon the ﬁrms with the most favourable
reputations within each industrial sector. However,
there is still considerable variation in the range of
reputational scores both within and between indus-
trial sectors and the scope of the sample embodies
many of the largest ﬁrms in the U.K. including 90%
of the FTSE 100.

Data on philanthropic expenditures and policies

The 1985 U.K. Companies Act obliges companies
to disclose donations to charities of over 200 pounds
in the directors’ report. Data on the level of phil-
anthropic expenditures are therefore readily available
in the U.K. context and were collected using Da-
taStream. Using this data, we constructed a variable,
CHARITY, which equals the level of ﬁrm philan-
thropic giving in 2002 measured in thousands of
pounds. Data concerning corporate community
involvement policies was based primarily on pub-
lished data. The Directory of Social Change (DSC)
publishes a biennial Guide to U.K. Company Giving.
The guide, designed as a tool for fundraising orga-
nizations, provides detailed information relating to
corporate charitable and community involvement
policies and management on a ﬁrm by ﬁrm basis.
The DSC compiles each ﬁrm’s entry in the guide by
integrating ﬁnancial data from published annual
reports with information obtained from a question-

(Robertson

Each ﬁrm’s entry in the guide also provides a
detailed breakdown of a range of policies concerning
the ﬁrm’s community involvement activities. Spe-
ciﬁcally, the guide describes the extent and nature of
employee involvement in community activities and
statements concerning prioritized and excluded areas
of community involvement. These data were sup-
plemented by information from two additional
sources. First, the PerCent club publishes an annual
benchmarking report with entries for each ﬁrm that
returns a postal survey. In 1999, 115 PerCent club
members participated in the benchmarking exercise.
This
report provides additional contextual and
practical
information relating to the participant’s
community involvement. Secondly, an increasing
number of ﬁrms disclose details of their community
involvement directly through annual reports and
websites. This material was used to supplement and
validate other sources of data.

Community involvement policies were analyzed
through a number of binary variables that reﬂect the
presence of corporate policies concerning philan-
thropic activities. In the detailed discussions of their
involvement policies many ﬁrms identiﬁed elements
that
involved their employees in the company’s
activities. Typically, ﬁrms identiﬁed whether or not
(a) operated a payroll giving scheme that
they:
facilitates
by
employees (PROWAGE), (b) matched individual
donations
to charity with company donations
(PROMATCH), and (c) supported employee vol-
unteering to community initiatives on company
time (PROVOL). A binary variable was constructed
for each of these dimensions which took a value of 1
if the company supported the particular initiative
and zero otherwise.

Areas of community involvement that were pri-
oritized or excluded by ﬁrms were identiﬁed by
examination of the ﬁrm’s detailed disclosures. Once
again, a set of binary variables was constructed to
facilitate analysis. The complete set of priorities and
exclusions was established through open coding and
subsequently restricted to the most commonly
expressed preferences. Binary variables were con-
structed that took a value of one if the ﬁrm excluded

religious (ANTIREL) or political (ANTIPOL) causes
from their community involvement and if they pri-
oritized educational charities (PROED) for each
identiﬁed priority or exclusion and zero otherwise.

Data on other ﬁrm characteristics

resources,

the value of

A measure of each ﬁrm’s size (SIZE) (the natural
logarithm of
total assets), principle
activity (approximately equivalent to the three-digit
NACE industry),
the number of outside (non-
executive) company directors (NONEXEC), ﬁrm
proﬁtability (measured by the ratio of pre-tax proﬁts
to total assets, ROTA), and corporate leverage
(measured by the ratio of total debt to total assets,
LEVERAGE) were extracted from accounting data
courtesy of DataStream. Using the DataStream
industry classiﬁcation, we allocated each ﬁrm to one
of twelve sectors: business services, chemicals, con-
struction, consumer products, engineering, ﬁnance,
high technology, publishing,
retail,
transportation, utilities. We also created two dummy
variables: SOCIAL took a value of one if the ﬁrm
operated in an industry with signiﬁcant
social
externalities4 and zero otherwise, ENV5 took a value
of one if the ﬁrm operated in an industry with sig-
niﬁcant environmental impacts and zero otherwise.
Much of the previous empirical work employs ﬁrm
size as a measure of visibility to external agents
(e.g. Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Bowen, 2000;
Damanpour, 1987). However, as Bowen (2000)
notes, organizational size is an unsatisfactory measure
of organizational visibility because it captures much
more than an organization’s visibility. Saiia (2000)
argues that the use of a commonly accepted metric is
necessary for consistent and replicable analysis of
corporate visibility or exposure. He concludes that
the best measures should incorporate readily avail-
able secondary data. Consistent with these argu-
ments, our approach is to use the incidence of news
media coverage of the ﬁrm as a measure of visibil-
ity6. This information was obtained form the Factiva
database, which provides searchable archives of news
content from over 8000 global sources. We gathered
the calendar years 1998–2002
data for each of
inclusive, and used the natural
logarithm of the
average number of annual news hits as our measure
of corporate visibility (VISIBILTY).


Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy

37

Data concerning the market performance of
sample companies was obtained from Barra Inc, a
leading risk specialist. We include BETA, a gauge of
the expected response of a stock to the overall
market, as a measure of the risks associated with
stock ownership. Market perceptions concerning
stock performance were captured through the
inclusion of two composite variables obtained from
Barra Inc. GROWTH is a variable that is based on
two dimensions of corporate growth: growth in
assets and earnings both measured over a 5 year
period. VALUE is a composite variable that is based
upon three performance ratios: earnings to price,
book value to price, and cash ﬂow to price. High
values of these ratios can signal the presence of assets
that are currently undervalued by the market and can
form the basis of trading strategy.

Ownership data were drawn in June 2002 from a
share ownership analysis database of more than 2000
listed U.K. ﬁrms managed by one of the U.K.’s
largest company registrars. Ownership data is con-
tinually updated to incorporate underlying beneﬁcial
ownership changes and investment managers’ hold-
ings from share trading information recorded daily
on the London Stock Exchange. The database di-
saggregates share ownership according to 32 differ-
ent types of beneﬁcial owner. Following, Ryan and
Schneider (2002) and Johnson and Greening (1999),
we created a variable, LONGTERM, that equalled
the sum of the proportion of ﬁrm equity held by
long term institutional
investors. Pension funds,
insurance companies and life assurors were classiﬁed
as long term investors.

Results

signiﬁcant

Table I presents descriptive statistics and correlation
coefﬁcients for the key variables. The magnitudes of
the correlation coefﬁcients indicate that multicolin-
earity is unlikely to present
statistical
difﬁculties. Table II reports the primary regression
results. Reﬂecting our
the
dependent variable is the ﬁrm reputation score as
reported in Management Today. Overall, the model
explains approximately half of the variance in the
dependent variable which is reasonable in the con-
text of a cross-sectional model and is equivalent to
the explanatory power of existing models.

earlier discussion,

Model 1 provides a point of departure with the
existing literature by examining a set of explanatory
variables roughly equivalent to those employed by
Fombrun and Shanley (1990). Consistent with
Fombrun and Shanley’s results, we ﬁnd that ﬁrm
reputation is positively inﬂuenced by current
ﬁnancial performance, as measured by proﬁtability
(p = 0.031), with the degree of ownership by long-
term ﬁnancial
institutions (p = 0.0001), and with
current market performance (as reﬂected by the
positive coecient on GROWTH (p = 0.041) and
the negative coecient on VALUE (p = 0.036)).
These results provide further conﬁrmation of the
ﬁndings of Fryxell and Wang (1994) which suggest
that reputational indices are highly correlated with
facets of corporate ﬁnancial performance. Contrary
to Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we ﬁnd that cor-
porate media visibility is strongly positively associ-
ated with ﬁrm reputation (p = 0.016).

to the introduction of

Model 2 extends Model 1 by introducing a set of
industry effects. Many of the results identiﬁed for
Model 1 are robust
the
industry dummy variables, and the importance of
controlling for industry discussed earlier is under-
lined by the signiﬁcant variation in reputational
scores across industries and the coincident leap in the
explanatory power of the empirical model. Model 3
introduces the level of ﬁrm charitable donations as
an explanatory variable and demonstrates that the
level of ﬁrm donations is strongly positively associ-
ated with ﬁrm reputation (p = 0.000). That chari-
table activities appear to have a positive impact upon
ﬁrm reputation is
signiﬁcant given the strong
emphasis of ﬁnancial performance within the con-
struction of reputational indices (Fryxell and Wang,
1994) and may suggest that philanthropic activities
are increasingly viewed as an important part of
corporate responsibility strategies (Porter and Kra-
mer, 2002; Saiia, 2000, 2002; Saiia et al., 2003).

Model 47 develops Model 3 by including six
variables that capture the most common policies that
apply to corporate community involvement initia-
tives in addition to the level of corporate donations.
Broadly,
that community
involvement policies have no signiﬁcant
impact
upon corporate reputations. Neither, exclusions
from unpopular religious or political afﬁliations nor
prioritizations for educational causes or employee
involvement initiatives seem to have any material

the ﬁndings

suggest

(p = 0.044). Given that there is likely to be little
direct beneﬁt to corporations of allowing their sta to

suggest that such activities are viewed as a waste of
corporate resources and, therefore, as being incom-
patible with the ﬁnancial objectives of the ﬁrm.

Model 5 extends the analysis further by intro-
ducing two industry effects, ENV and SOCIAL,
which reﬂect a ﬁrm’s activity in industries associated
with signiﬁcant environmental or social externalities
respectively. Model 5 also includes interaction terms
between ﬁrm charitable donations and membership
of
these environmentally and socially damaging
industries and therefore permits the impact upon
reputation of being in a sensitive industry to vary
with the level of corporate philanthropy. The results
suggest that operating in an environmentally sensi-
tive industry is not associated with a lower corporate
reputation but that ﬁrms in industries with signiﬁ-
cant
social externalities have signiﬁcantly poorer
reputations (p = 0.073). Furthermore, on average,
the negative impact of operating in a socially dam-
aging industry is equivalent to more than 10% of the

reputational eect of operating in a socially damaging
industry is found to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
the level of corporate philanthropic expenditures
(p = 0.002) suggesting, that philanthropy helps to
mitigate the negative reputational consequences of
operating in controversial business
sectors. This
ﬁnding is consistent with Williams and Barrett’s

and reputation is stronger among companies that
more frequently violate occupational health and
safety and environmental regulations.

Discussion and conclusion

This paper has analyzed the determinants of corpo-
rate reputation within a sample of large U.K. com-
panies drawn from a diverse range of industries. We
have paid particular attention to the role that phil-
anthropic expenditures and policies may play in
shaping the perceptions of companies among their
stakeholders. Our ﬁndings highlight that companies

performance of organizations above other factors
(Fryxell and Wang, 1994) and that elements of the
literature emphasise that discretionary aspects of
social responsibility, including corporate donations,
may not be in the ﬁnancial interests of organizations
(e.g. Friedman, 1970), this is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding. It
suggests that philanthropic expenditures may play a
signiﬁcant role in stakeholder management and may,
in particular,
lead to stakeholders holding more
positive impressions of philanthropic corporations.

Additionally, our analysis also suggests that the
impact of philanthropic expenditures on corporate
reputations is, to some extent, industry speciﬁc. We
ﬁnd that philanthropy has a signiﬁcantly larger effect
on reputations in industries that exhibit signiﬁcant
social externalities, such as the alcoholic drink and
tobacco sectors, than it does in other sectors. This
suggests, consistent with the ﬁndings of Williams and
Barrett (2000), that philanthropy may help compa-
nies to atone for socially irresponsible behaviours and
that these expenditures may help to protect corpo-
rate reputations against these negative stakeholder
perceptions. The fact that this effect doesn’t appear
to operate within environmentally sensitive indus-
tries may
perceive
philanthropy to be unrelated to environmental
performance.

Distinctively, our analysis permits us to evaluate
whether
corporate
philanthropy is contingent upon two factors: (i) how
the philanthropy is implemented – gifts in cash
versus with the involvement of employees, and
(ii) the destination of philanthropic expenditures.
Concerning the ﬁrst issue, we ﬁnd that cash giving
generates more signiﬁcant reputational payoffs than
does involving employees through matched giving
or volunteering. Therefore, our analysis suggests that
ﬁrms seeking to maximise the reputational impacts
should make more cash donations. This observation
is consistent with the external bias present in the
construction of reputational data such as those we
have analysed. Employee involvement
initiatives
appear not to inﬂuence the perceptions of the ﬁrm in
the eyes of external stakeholders but might play a
signiﬁcant role in motivating internal stakeholders


Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy

(Peterson, 2004). Future work might explore these
issues in more detail.

Turning to the destination of philanthropic
expenditures, we ﬁnd no strong evidence that
community involvement policies have any direct or
indirect effect on corporate reputation; neither fail-
ing to exclude unpopular causes, nor including
popular ones appears to have any impact on repu-
tation. There is much discussion in the voluntary
sector about the relationships between companies
and charitable organizations that centres on the dif-
ference between attractive and unattractive (viewed
from the perspective of companies) causes and
highlights that many worthy, but unattractive causes,
ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to attract corporate funding.
Perhaps, in light of our ﬁndings, ﬁrms can be more
conﬁdent about supporting unpopular or unattrac-
tive causes given that there is no reputational loss
associated with doing so.

In other respects, our ﬁndings are consistent with
elements of the existing literature. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁnd evidence that ﬁrm reputation is positively
inﬂuenced by current ﬁnancial performance (whe-
ther measure by accounting or market methods), and
with the degree of ownership by long-term ﬁnancial
institutions. We also ﬁnd that reputations vary sys-
tematically across industries, conﬁrming the need to
control for industry in studies of reputation, partic-
ularly when operationalizations of reputation are
industry speciﬁc in the sense that respondents are
asked to rate ﬁrms
relative to industry peers
(Fombrun and Shanley, 1990)

This study suffers from limitations that could be
addressed in future work. First, our analysis is cross-
sectional in nature and future attempts to examine
the patterns we have identiﬁed within a longitudinal
framework would both help to resolve remaining
issues concerning causality and shed more light on
the evolving relationship between philanthropy and
reputation among U.K. ﬁrms. Second, our study, in
common with much of the empirical work in the
area conducted in the U.K., would beneﬁt from
the improved availability of data, particularly in the
context of measuring corporate reputation that
would permit richer analyses. We would welcome
the availability of reputational data that is consis-
tently available for a large sample of companies that
is derived from alternative methodologies, such as
those proposed by Gardberg and Fombrun (2002).

2 Making in excess of £50,000 per year in charitable
donations is a condition of membership of the FTSE4
Good index, the ﬁrst socially responsible investment in-
dex launched in the U.K.
3 Nearly a third of British consumers had bought a
product or service because the ﬁrm had a link with a char-
itable organization (Business in the Community, 2001)
4 The alcoholic beverage, tobacco, defence and phar-
maceutical industries were deﬁned as having signiﬁcant
social externalities.
5 The chemical, resource extraction, and utilities sectors
were deﬁned as having high environmental impacts.
6 Meznar and Nigh (1995) adopt a similar approach to
measuring organizational visibility. They measured visi-
bility as the number of stories concerning a ﬁrm in ﬁve
US national daily newspapers over a 15 month period.
They speciﬁcally excluded the Wall Street Journal from
this list because ‘‘of its strong emphasis on economic is-
sues’’ (Meznar and Nigh, 1995, p. 983).
7 The number of observations falls signiﬁcantly (from
around 200 to 140) when the policy variables are intro-
duced. We conducted consistency checks to ensure that
other results were robust to the reduction in sample size,
but preferred to report the results for the largest samples
available because of the increase in degrees of freedom.
8 We estimated alternative variants of the model that
permitted the impact of policies to vary across different
ﬁrm sizes and for different levels of corporate philan-
thropy, but, perhaps because of the reduction in the
number of degrees of freedom, no signiﬁcant patterns
were identiﬁed.
