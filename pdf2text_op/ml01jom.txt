Abstract

This study argues that a well designed decision making process will have its most positive impact
on company ﬁnancial performance when it is carried out by a capable, motivated and dedicated
workforce. Prior research has determined that such a workforce can be developed via an organiza-
tion’s commitment to its employees (OCE) in the form of ample training and compensation, fairness,
and meaningful personal consideration. We argue that OCE will enhance ﬁnancial performance where
it is able to improve the quality of a decision making process that emphasizes ample information
processing, collaboration, and initiative. Conversely, these three dimensions of decision making are
expected to be of little value where OCE—and hence a capable and motivated workforce—are
lacking. These expectations were borne out in our study of Korean companies. Speciﬁcally, we found
positive associations between return on assets and the interactions between OCE and information
processing, collaboration, and initiative, respectively. We found also that these interactions contributed the
most to return on assets in uncertain environments, where effective information processing, collaboration
and initiative were especially important. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. People, process and performance

For many years, scholars of organizations have attempted to link different aspects of the
decision making process to organizational performance outcomes. But efforts to date have
met with only modest success. Although there has been a great deal of discussion about the

importance of decision making dimensions such as careful analysis, environmental scanning,
collaboration, and even initiative, the jury is not yet in on how useful these qualities are to
a ﬁrm’s bottom line (Mintzberg, 1994; Noda & Bower, 1996). While convincing conceptual
arguments have been advanced to support the utility of decision and environmental analysis,
cooperation among decision makers, and a bias towards action, the supporting empirical
evidence has been weak and conﬂicting (compare, for example, Fredrickson & Mitchell,
1984; Eisenhardt, 1989; Miller & Cardinal, 1994).

The thesis of this article is that the most frequently discussed process dimensions of
decision making, by themselves, are unlikely to contribute to superior performance. Rather,
it is only when an organization is able to build a cadre of capable, dedicated decision makers
that it will be able to execute process effectively and earn superior ﬁnancial returns (Barney,
1986; Barney & Zajac, 1994; Lado & Wilson, 1994). For example, analysis or scanning of
the competitive environment is apt to be more effective when performed by a corps of able,
committed individuals using their imaginations and initiative than when executed in rote
fashion. Similarly, consultation among decision makers will be more productive when it is
done in a spirit of cooperation and dedication than when it serves as an occasion for
politicking or bickering. In addition, proactive decision making is best when employees have
the interests of the organization at heart, not when it serves to further empire building or
advance individual careers. We are not arguing that these process dimensions of decision
making are not important—they are. But they alone are unlikely to have much impact on the
bottom line without a capable, dedicated, and motivated workforce to ensure their quality.
The question then becomes: How can an organization develop such a force of inspired
decision makers?

Recent research in organizational behavior and human resource management has shown
that an organization’s commitment to its employees (OCE) tends in turn to create a more
committed and responsible workforce (Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1987; 1990; Organ, 1990;
Moorman, Blakely & Niehoff, 1998; Mowday, Porter & Steers, 1984; Shore & Wayne, 1993;
Steers & Porter, 1987: 575–583). OCE is evidenced by factors such as a company’s care for
its employees’ well being and satisfaction, by the fairness and compassion shown in its
rewards and punishments, and by the level of its investment in human resource development
and compensation (Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1987; 1990; Organ, 1990). Outcomes of actual
or even perceived OCE have been demonstrated to include: more dedicated and motivated
employees (Organ, 1988; Shore & Wayne, 1993), greater initiative and creativity at work
(Eisenberger et al., 1990), and a stronger sense of cooperation and community (Setton et al.,
1996; Wayne et al., 1997).

An emerging body of research at a more macro, organizational level of analysis has
conﬁrmed many of these ﬁndings. Studies have begun to show that some types of OCE,
namely progressive human resources management practices in training, compensation, and
reward-sharing, have improved manufacturing quality, reduced turnover, and enhanced
ﬁnancial performance (Arthur, 1994; Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Snell &
Youndt, 1995). Lee and Miller (1999) have shown that OCE can even help ensure that
market cost leadership and differentiation strategies will be better executed. In short, effects
of organizational practices on individual perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, can collec-
tively produce critical effects at the organizational level.

But to date, too few studies have delved into the potential reasons for a relationship
between high commitment work practices and organizational performance and effectiveness.
The causal and moderating mechanisms are buried inside a “black box.” We believe that one
critical reason why OCE and progressive HRM practices may have a profound impact on
performance is because they lead to better decision making. This study will argue that three
of the most often discussed dimensions of decision making process: information processing,
collaboration, and initiative, will enhance ﬁnancial performance where OCE is strong—that
is, where a high level of commitment to employees contributes to the capability, dedication,
and motivation of the entire workforce. That workforce includes everyone involved in
making decisions, from the upper and middle managers charged with deciding issues, to the
staff experts gathering and analyzing information and presenting options, to the equally
important line personnel who must recognize problems and opportunities and suggest ways
of addressing them. We will argue further that the stronger decision making process that
results from OCE will be especially valuable for ﬁnancial performance in uncertain envi-
ronments, where intelligent and energized decision making is very much required to keep an
organization in tune with its competitive setting (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998).

Our research is on Korean companies. In Korea, the relationship of ﬁrms or superiors to
their employees is typically one of paternalism. There, businesses or bosses are expected to
assume responsibility for the overall well-being and development of their subordinates
(Steers, Shin & Ungson, 1989: 98 –103). Also, a Confucian work ethic prevails which truly
prizes the importance of superior and subordinate contributing together to the work group
and the corporation (Choi, 1985; Ko, 1992; Han, 1991; Ungson, Steers & Park, 1997).
Anecdotal accounts suggest that these Confucian ethics coupled with managerial paternalism
blend to create a climate in which those ﬁrms most committed to their employees receive
unusual dedication from them in return (Lee & Lee, 1994; Lee & Miller, 1999). Korean
organizations, therefore, were deemed to be especially promising sites for establishing the
relationships between OCE, decision making, and ﬁnancial performance—they are espe-
cially apt to show an effect from OCE.

1.1. The nature and effects of OCE

We have already indicated that OCE is a multifaceted concept. And indeed, an organi-
zation can exhibit commitment to its employees in many ways. A ﬁrm may be solicitous of
workers’ physical and emotional well-being, devote itself to a high level of job satisfaction
and employee development, provide fair and ample compensation, and share its proﬁts
(Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1990; Huselid, 1995; Mowday et al., 1984; Organ, 1990; Orpen,
1995; Williams & Anderson, 1991). Companies committed to their employees typically
invest more than similar ﬁrms in progressive HRM practices such as training and education,
and in the total package of compensation (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995). They also distribute
rewards more equitably and charitably. Companies may, for example, share proﬁts in times
of abundance or, when conditions tighten, cut top managers’ compensation to avoid layoffs.
Also they may try to ensure good working conditions and, wherever possible, create
rewarding, well-designed jobs (Eisenberger et al., 1986).

These forms of OCE were found to have important effects on behavior at work. Eisen-
berger et al. (1990), Moorman et al. (1998) and Shore and Wayne (1993) discovered that
perceived OCE made employees more conscientious in carrying out their job responsibilities.
It also engendered a sense of involvement with the company, and greater employee initiative
and innovation. Organ and Konovsky (1989) and O’Reilly and Chatman (1986) noticed that
an organization’s commitment to its employees even stimulated more company “citizenship”
behavior from people. Speciﬁcally, it caused employees at all levels to become more
dedicated to the organization and more prepared to exceed their job requirements. At the
organizational level of analysis, studies of progressive HRM practices in training, compen-
sation and reward sharing have shown that these can lead to reduced turnover and absen-
teeism, better quality work, and better ﬁnancial performance (Arthur, 1994; Delaney &
Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Snell & Youndt, 1995).

Anecdotal evidence has shown these reactions to be especially strong within Korean
companies (Lee & Lee, 1994). This may be because of the sense of community and devotion
that OCE engenders within Confucian cultures (Park, 1984; Ko, 1992; Han, 1991). Accord-
ing to sociologists, community can be construed as an emotional environment that induces
members to cooperate in the pursuit of common goals (Brownwell, 1950; Nisbet, 1962).
Members are sustained emotionally by the community— here by an organization. They
experience a sense of belonging and of devotion to the group. Such attachment is a strong
motivator in performing group-related tasks, fostering cooperation and collaboration, and
unleashing initiative (Choi, 1994).

1.2. Commitment, decision making, and performance

Organizational processes are only as good as the people who carry them out. The best
conceived programs are unlikely to succeed if the people designing and executing them are
incapable or unmotivated (Lado & Wilson, 1994). In the same way, decision making
processes, no matter how intendedly rational, putatively collaborative, or proactive by
design, will falter unless they are performed with intelligence, cooperation, and dedication to
ﬁrm objectives. In short, the positive outcomes reported for OCE may be highly pertinent for
enhancing the quality of decision making.

Drucker (1993), Pfeffer (1993), and Whitney (1994), for example, have shown how the
emotional and social climate inside a ﬁrm can enhance productivity, spur creativity, and
speed implementation. Ghoshal and Bartlett (1995) believe that the most responsive and
competitive organizations—those that develop the deepest and most relevant competen-
cies—are the ones that are best able to pull their managers and workers together, commit
them to the organization, and help them transcend narrow personal interests. The resulting
workforce is better at identifying important challenges and opportunities, and far more
willing to collaborate across functional areas.

Unfortunately, there has so far been little research on the impact of OCE on proﬁtability.
Most studies have been conducted on many employees within a single organization, and
focus on outcomes such as turnover, satisfaction, and attitudes towards work. Although some
organization level studies of HRM practices have shown some bottom line effects, only the
more concrete, policy driven aspects of OCE are captured by HRM. In addition, the decision

167

making process has been ignored as a potential mediating construct between OCE and
ﬁnancial performance. We believe that although OCE may enhance proﬁtability, it will have
its greatest effect where the employee capabilities and motivations it unleashes are harnessed
by an effective decision making process. Unless decision makers at all levels of a company
are guided to make decisions in a manner that stresses awareness, reﬂection, collaboration
and initiative, their ﬁrm will not be able to recognize and adapt to the most important
challenges and opportunities. In other words, unless a capable and dedicated workforce is
embedded in an effective process of decision making that exploits its talents, the beneﬁts of
OCE many not exceed its costs.

2. Hypotheses

In integrative reviews of the literature on decision making process, three dimensions come
up again and again as being potentially vital to the quality of decision making (c.f. the
syntheses of Fredrickson, 1986, Miller, 1987, Mintzberg, 1973, and Hart, 1992). Although
they have been named differently we call these dimensions information processing, collab-
oration, and initiative. The information processing dimension reﬂects the effort devoted to
scanning and analyzing information to better understand a company’s threats, opportunities
and options. The collaboration dimension gauges how much people consult and collaborate
together in making decisions. And the initiative dimension assesses whether decision makers
are biased towards action or proactiveness in competing and getting things done. While each
of these dimensions has the potential to contribute to more effective decisions, we suspect
that this potential will not be realized unless decision makers are capable, motivated, and
committed to their companies. In other words, even the most promising approaches to
making decisions will produce little beneﬁt without the support of a cadre of competent,
motivated human resources (Barney, 1986; Barney & Zajac, 1994; Lado & Wilson, 1994).
Previous research has shown that OCE will help to create these resources (Eisenberger et al.,
1986; 1990; Moorman et al., 1998; O’Reilly & Chatman, 1986; Organ & Konovsky, 1989;
Shore & Wayne, 1993).

2.1. Information processing

A recurrent theme in the literature on decision making concerns what may broadly be
termed information processing. Different aspects of the information processing dimension
have variously been referred to as analysis and scanning (Aguilar, 1967), intended rationality
(Miller, 1987), comprehensiveness (Fredrickson, 1986), and synoptic decision making (Hart,
1992). The essential contrast here is between unreﬂective and intuitive decision making and
a process that takes into account, more thoroughly and systematically, a wider range of
information. One might, for example, contrast Cyert and March’s (1963) and Lindblom’s
(1968) locally focused and cognitively truncated modes of decision making with Ansoff
(1965) and Andrews’ (1971) more systematic and painstaking approaches. Our own infor-
mation processing construct is not, however, concerned with achieving some rational ideal,
with all the delays that entails. Rather it assesses the range of information considered in

making decisions, the depth of such consideration, and the assurance that external as well as
internal matters are taken into account.

Previous studies reveal conﬂicting evidence of the efﬁcacy of comprehensive approaches
to information processing. The earliest literature argued that formal analysis and planning
were useful for helping managers understand their environments and better utilize their
resources (Steiner, 1969). But most empirical studies of systematic planning have not
detected links with performance (Mintzberg, 1994). Indeed, Mintzberg (1994) has argued
that rigid planning processes are counterproductive.

Although there is little reason to believe that planning rituals per se will have any effect
on the quality of decisions, some scholars have rightly maintained that information process-
ing, more broadly deﬁned, can support more effective decision making. For example,
creative option generation, incisive analysis, and dedicated environmental scanning might all
improve the quality and relevance of decisions (Wilensky, 1971; Wildavsky, 1979). Unfor-
tunately, here again empirical research results were mixed and conﬂicting. Some analyses
indicated that such aspects of information processing are useful even in turbulent environ-
ments (Eisenhardt, 1989), other studies that they are useful only in stable environments
(Fredrickson & Mitchell, 1984), and other research still that they are of questionable utility
altogether (Mintzberg, 1994).

We believe that information processing in the form of assiduous scanning of the envi-
ronment and intelligent and systematic analysis of problems and opportunities can be useful
for many companies. Scanning can uncover important customer needs, market threats and
opportunities, as well as areas of strategy requiring improvement (Aguilar, 1967). By the
same token, devoted and expert analysis of conditions inside and outside a company
decreases chances of making errors and improves the quality of the options considered and
the choices made (Andrews, 1971; Hart, 1992; Wilensky, 1971). So why does the literature
fail to show clearly the beneﬁts of such information processing?

We think the reason is that the amount of scanning or analysis and even the techniques
used fail to get at what is most important about information processing—namely its qual-
ity—that is, the intelligence and commitment that is brought to bear on information pro-
cessing activities. Scanning can be broad, but misdirected; intensive but irrelevant. Analysis
too can be systematic, but off the mark and uninspired. Only a capable and dedicated cadre
of decision makers—from managers to staff experts to line operatives— can make scanning
and analysis really work. Employees who are well trained and dedicated to the interests of
their organizations are more likely to engage in scanning that is important, follow leads that
matter, poll customers with real interest, and monitor competitors with concern. Such
employees will also work harder to generate creative decision options, dedicate themselves
to discovering opportunities and challenges, and act in an informed and timely fashion. In
referring to the quality of information processing, we do not mean its informality or
ﬂexibility. Formal processes can be hidebound, or they can serve as useful guides for
informed and motivated decision makers. Similarly, ﬂexible processes can be chaotic when
performed by poorly trained managers, or they can be liberating when engaged by managers
working in the best interests of their organizations.

We noted above that prior research has demonstrated that OCE has an important impact
on employee behavior and attitudes. It contributes to the capability, dedication, motivation

Fig. 1. Relating OCE and Decision Making to Company Performance.

Items in boldface are those measured in this study; others are mediating constructs that we could not assess in
this research. We showed that the relationships of OCE with employee capability, dedication, commitment and
cooperation have already been well established by numerous researchers. The effects of those decision maker
characteristics on the quality of information processing, collaboration and initiative—and hence on proﬁtability,
have been argued in the paper, and are reﬂected, indirectly, in the analyses of Tables 3 and 4.

and initiative of the workforce. If so, it is reasonable to believe that OCE will enhance the
quality of information processing, and through it, the level of ﬁnancial returns (please see
our model on Fig. 1). Thus our ﬁrst hypothesis:

H1: Financial returns will be positively inﬂuenced by the interaction between OCE and
information processing. Speciﬁcally, scanning and analysis are apt to improve ﬁnan-
cial performance only if there is a high level of OCE.
Qualiﬁcation: We do not expect the quantity information processing, by itself, to have
much impact on performance. It is only the happy combination of quantity and quality that
can truly enhance performance. Unfortunately, most survey research on decision making is
unable to assess the quality of processes such as information processing. We believe that the
null and conﬂicting results of past process studies reﬂect this inability. And since our study
too cannot directly assess the quality of decision making, our measures of process alone are
unlikely to bear any direct relationship to proﬁtability.

2.2. Collaboration

Another central dimension of decision making is collaboration—the degree to which
people consult and interact with one another in making decisions. Collaboration is a function
of the number of individuals and departments involved in making decisions, as well as the
scope and intensity of their deliberations (Floyd & Wooldridge, 1996; Fredrickson, 1986;
Miller, 1987). A high level of collaboration exists, for example, when different parties or
groups communicate frequently in identifying and resolving a broad range of issues.

Some studies have argued that collaboration allows managers to reconcile or creatively
integrate diverse perspectives. As a result, it renders decisions more informed and more
pertinent (Amason, 1995; Mason & Mitroff, 1981). Such collaboration has been deemed
especially useful among middle managers (Floyd & Wooldridge, 1996; Miller, 1987; Wool-
dridge & Floyd, 1990). By contrast, other scholars have suggested that collaborative activity

can slow things down, especially when there is broad involvement from functional units that
embrace conﬂicting ideologies or perspectives (Fiol, 1994; Labovitz & Rosansky, 1998;
Wildavsky, 1979). Interaction may also bring warring parties together, allowing political
agendas and gamesmanship to take precedence over organizational needs (Pettigrew, 1973;
Whitney, 1994). In some cases, so much emphasis may be put on consultation and meetings,
that responsibility is diffused and no one feels accountable for any decision (Wilensky,
1971).

This Janus-faced aspect of collaboration suggests that its implications for performance are
unclear. Again, it seems, it is not only the quantity of collaboration that is important, but also
the quality. And the latter relies on the capabilities, and dedication of decision makers: Will
they be subject to political scufﬂing, or will they subordinate their parochial interests for the
good of the ﬁrm? Will they interact to improve the quality of their decisions and sharpen their
sensitivity, or will they meet endlessly and mire themselves in peripheral matters?

We believe that OCE, by building a workforce that has the interests of the company at
heart, will minimize parochial politics and facilitate effective collaboration. It will make
employees more willing to sacriﬁce their short term interests to the overall needs of the
company (Moorman et al., 1998; Setton et al., 1996). It will also foster trust, making decision
makers at all levels more willing to share information with superiors, peers and subordinates
(Senge, 1990; Wayne et al., 1997). In this climate, discussions may focus on more mean-
ingful information and more accurate interpretations (Senge, 1990). Clearly then, OCE can
improve the quality of collaboration and so lead to more informed and timely decisions and
to better ﬁnancial performance.

H2: Financial returns will be positively inﬂuenced by the interaction between OCE and
collaboration. Speciﬁcally, collaboration among decision makers is more apt to im-
prove ﬁnancial performance if there is a high level of OCE.

2.3. Initiative

Our initiative dimension assesses the degree to which decision makers take a proactive
stance in addressing problems and opportunities (Collins & Moore, 1970; Miller, 1987;
Mintzberg, 1973). Initiative may be contrasted with inertia or purely reactive behavior. For
example, do managers look for opportunities, try to beat competitors to the punch, or take
substantial risks in pursuing growth or innovation? Or do they delay taking action, lag their
rivals, and eschew risk taking to the point of stagnation?

Some scholars have argued that initiative is healthy for a company. It can keep a ﬁrm
energized, innovative, and entrepreneurial. It combats stagnation, makes a company adap-
tive, and keeps it in tune with its environment (Eisenhart, 1989; Miller, 1987). It also allows
some organizations to beat their rivals in seizing market opportunities and establishing ﬁrst
mover advantages (Collins & Moore, 1970; Teece et al., 1997). And it can generate rapid
growth (Miller, 1990). But there is a darker side to initiative. It may allow too much risk
taking. Bold actions are notoriously costly when they miss their mark. And if initiatives at
lower levels of an organization are uncoordinated, they can result in conﬂicting product
offerings and market positions (Pettigrew, 1973). Bold initiative may also take the form of

171

empire building that serves the interests of a single manager at the expense of the whole
company (Miller, 1990; Pettigrew, 1973).

It seems then that as with information processing and collaboration, it is not only the
quantity but the quality of initiative that matters most to the bottom line. And once again the
soundness of the entire cadre of decision makers may be crucial in this regard. Dedicated,
responsible employees are far more apt to use their initiative intelligently and responsi-
bly— by pursuing the most sensible opportunities, eschewing unnecessary risks, and avoid-
ing actions that conﬂict with the best interests of the company. OCE, once again, may help
create such a workforce. It has been shown to engender a greater sense of community and
responsibility (Eisenberger et al., 1987, 1990); one that makes employees take to heart the
mission, principles, and well-being of the larger group (Moorman et al., 1993; 1995). OCE
should therefore enhance the quality—the promise, judiciousness, and organization-wide
beneﬁts— of initiative.

H3: Financial returns will be positively inﬂuenced by the interaction between OCE and
initiative. Speciﬁcally, initiative among decision makers is more apt to improve ﬁnan-
cial performance if there is a high level of OCE.

2.4. Environment

Some scholars have argued that the decision making process is especially important to an
organization’s success in more challenging environments. Intensive and effective informa-
tion processing, collaboration, and initiative among decision makers are needed to help
companies to adapt to uncertain, dynamic environments (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998; Eisen-
hardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Bourgeois, 1988). In these contexts it is particularly vital to track
competitor initiatives, technological changes, and altering demand patterns, as these chal-
lenges evolve rapidly and are of real consequence to a ﬁrm’s performance. The need to adapt
to these challenges requires that more information be gathered from the environment and
subjected to incisive analysis (Aguilar, 1967; Wilensky, 1971). The complexity of an
uncertain environment also demands more effective collaboration—more discussion and
interaction among decision makers with different kinds of knowledge (Katzenbach & Smith,
1993). In addition, the higher levels of change in uncertain settings make inertia especially
dangerous. They demand that managers act quickly, assume the initiative, and take calcu-
lated risks to stave off obsolescence and seize opportunities (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998;
Eisenhardt, 1989). In summary, under demanding conditions of uncertainty, the quality of
information processing, collaboration, and initiative are particularly important as they help
to facilitate complex adaptation. As we have argued, OCE can contribute to such quality.
By contrast, in stable environments where products, customer tastes, and technologies
change very slowly and predictably, fewer complex decisions are needed to adapt the ﬁrm
to its environment. Effective information processing, collaboration and initiative thus be-
come less important to proﬁtability.

H4: The interactions between OCE and all three of our process dimensions will
contribute more to performance in uncertain than in stable environments.

3. Method

3.1. The sample

We stated earlier that we chose to study Korean companies in part because of their
communal, paternalistic cultures and the potential importance of commitment to employees
within these organizations (Ko, 1992; Han, 1991; Lee & Lee, 1994). The industries selected
for study were textiles, machinery, automotive parts, and electronics. These domains were
chosen because of the large number of Korean companies operating in each, because they
represented both thriving and faltering sectors of the economy, and because their ﬁrms
demonstrate large variations in process and performance. To ensure comparability among
our ﬁrms we studied only manufacturers. We avoided foreign companies and government-
run organizations, and selected only single-business enterprises or single-business proﬁt
centers of multibusiness companies—all from different parents. Our target population within
the four industries consisted of 350 randomly chosen ﬁrms that met the above criteria and
were listed in the 1994 Report of the Korean Productivity Center.

We ﬁrst approached ﬁrms by writing a letter to the chief executives, asking if they and
their ﬁrm would participate in our study of strategic management practices. Of those
approached, 158 agreed to cooperate in the study. Only these ﬁrms were sent questionnaires,
and 129 of them responded with the requisite two questionnaires each (see below). The top
managers of all ﬁrms that agreed to participate were contacted by telephone after they had
received the questionnaires. This was done to further gain their commitment to the study, to
ensure that the right executives would be responding to the questions, and to go over the
instrument to explain any items that might be unclear. This task was performed by four
research assistants ﬁnishing their Masters’ theses in strategic management. The assistants
were all trained by the principal investigator to deﬁne and explain all of the scale items. In
all cases, the respondents themselves rated each question and then returned the question-
naires to us.

The topmost executives (directors general or general managers) completed the scales on
decision making, environmental uncertainty and one of our OCE measures, while the most
senior vice presidents provided information on our other OCE measure and ﬁnancial
performance. These individuals were chosen because they were the most knowledgeable
about the dimensions we were examining. Our use of different respondents within each ﬁrm
also guarded against common method variance in the testing of our hypotheses. In order to
minimize chances of raters distorting their answers, we assured all respondents that their
responses would be kept completely conﬁdential. We promised that we would never reveal
to anyone the names of the managers or the names of their organizations.

Our ﬁnal sample consisted of 38 textile ﬁrms, 31 machinery ﬁrms, 30 automotive parts
producers, and 30 electronics ﬁrms. Of the respondents, 108 companies were independent
ﬁrms, while 21 ﬁrms were subsidiaries of larger enterprises. To guard against nonresponse
bias we compared the revenues and return on assets ﬁgures of our sample with those of the
four industries for the same year (1994). Industry averages were obtained from the Korean
Productivity Center (Hangook Giup Chongram, 1990 –1995). For the textile and electronics
industries there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between our respondents and the

industry averages for revenues and ROA. But for the machinery and auto parts industry, our
sample ﬁrms did show somewhat higher ROAs. Thus our ﬁndings may not apply with equal
precision to poorly performing machinery and auto parts companies.

3.2. The instruments and variables

All questionnaire items were translated from English into Korean by one of the authors,
a Korean native educated in the US who has taught in several top American business schools.
Each translated item was discussed with four Korean graduate students of organizational
behavior and strategy who were ﬂuent in the English language.

Organizational commitment to employees (OCE) was measured in two ways, with each
measure being completed by a different respondent in the organization. The two measures
and two respondents were used to enhance the validity of the results. The ﬁrst measure,
OCE1, was assessed using four anchored ﬁve-point Likert-Scale items suggested by Eisen-
berger et al. (1986) (see Appendix 1): These assessed how much the organization cares about
employee well-being, about ample and fair pay, about satisfaction at work, and about sharing
proﬁts. Choi (1990) and Lee and Lee (1994, 1995) argue how important these factors are to
Korean workers’ dedication to an organization and its objectives. The Cronbach alpha for the
OCE1 measure was 0.82. The most senior vice president of each organization completed this
scale.

The second measure of OCE, OCE2, employed two 5-point Likert scales asking the CEO
of the ﬁrm to rate his organization relative to its principal competitors on 1.) how much the
company invested in education and competence development for its employees, and 2.) how
much the company invested in total compensation, including beneﬁts, for its employees. The
Cronbach alpha for this OCE2 measure was 0.71. The topmost executive of each organiza-
tion completed these scales. Although OCE1 and OCE2 correlated signiﬁcantly (r 5 0.26,
p , 0.003), the two scales clearly measured different aspects of the commitment to
employees construct, and afforded some opportunity for testing the robustness of our
ﬁndings. This was conﬁrmed by the exploratory factor analysis of Table 2A.

The three dimensions of decision making were assessed using the anchored Likert scales
of Miller (1987) translated into Korean. Information processing was measured using Miller’s
(1987) scales for scanning and analysis (8 items); these items gauge how much information
is gathered about the market environment and how much thought and analysis go into
making decisions. Collaboration was measured using Miller’s scales for interaction (5
items); these items measure how much people and groups interact, communicate and consult
in making decisions. Finally, Initiative was measured using Miller’s scales for proactiveness
and risk taking (4 items); these assess how willing mangers are to take some competitive
initiative and the accompanying risks in order to grow, innovate or beat rivals to the punch.
Appendix 1 presents the items used in our survey.

The Cronbach alphas for the three decision making dimensions of information processing,
collaboration, and initiative, were 0.81, 0.79 and 0.77, respectively. An exploratory factor
analysis (orthogonal, varimax) was run to determine whether the items loaded on the three
process dimensions as expected. The results are given on Table 2B, and show the sharp
pattern of loadings for the items used. The items all loaded highly only on their own process

dimension and not on either of the others. Thus we averaged the items to produce a
composite score for each of the three dimensions.

Financial Performance was measured using return on assets. This measure has been the
most widely used to date in business research (Hambrick, 1983; Rumelt, 1984) and applies
with equal relevance to each of the industries we studied. We asked the top executives to
supply from their ﬁnancial statements ﬁgures on sales, total assets, and before-tax earnings.
For the 30 public companies, we obtained published ﬁnancial reports to conﬁrm the ﬁgures
provided by the top managers. ROA as computed from published ﬁgures correlated at 0.98
with ROA computed from data supplied by the managers.

Because the level of uncertainty, that is, change and unpredictability, in a ﬁrm’s market
can itself inﬂuence ﬁnancial performance, we controlled for this in all of our analyses.
Uncertainty was measured using the 5 anchored 5-point Likert scales of Khandwalla (1977)
and Miller (1987) (see Appendix). The scales assessed the rate of product obsolescence, the
frequency of changes in industry marketing practices and technologies, and the predictability
of competitors’ activities and customers’ demands. The Cronbach alpha for uncertainty was
0.63, a modest value no doubt due to the very diverse indicators composing the variable. We
also employed industry dummies as control variables in all of our hypothesis tests.

3.3. Inter-rater reliability

We wished to ensure that respondents from within the same company agreed in their
responses to the questionnaire. So we had two respondents in 25 companies reply to the same
questions. Responses were given independently and without consultation among the partic-
ipants. The Pearson correlations among the two respondents averaged as follows for our
variables: OCE1, 0.67, OCE2, 0.68, information processing, 0.70, collaboration, 0.64, and
initiative, 0.60. All of these relationships were signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.005 level, and were
acceptable according to the criteria established by Khandwalla (1977: 658) and Van de Ven
& Ferry (1981).

3.4. Analyses

The means and standard deviations for the total sample are given on Table 1A, as are the
breakdowns by industry. The correlation matrix is given in Table 1B. Hypotheses 1 to 3 were
tested using the moderated OLS regression analyses of Tables 3 and 4. In these analyses,
return on assets is regressed against OCE, uncertainty, industry dummies, and the three
process dimensions, respectively. In order to establish the robustness of our ﬁndings,
separate analyses were conducted for OCE1 and OCE2. The hypotheses were tested using
interaction variables between either OCE1 (Table 3) or OCE2 (Table 4) and each of the
process dimensions. The statistical signiﬁcance of the additional variance explained over and
above the otherwise full model was then computed. In order to reduce potential problems of
multicollinearity, the components of the interaction term were standardized before multipli-
cation (Smith and Sasaki, 1979).

Hypothesis 4 maintained that the interaction between our process variables and OCE
would contribute more to performance in uncertain than in stable, predictable environments.

We employed three-way interaction terms to test this hypothesis. Speciﬁcally, to the full
models of Tables 3 and 4 (i.e., with an OCE-uncertainty interaction term added), we added
another interaction term which is a product of the process dimension, OCE, and uncertainty.
We examined the sign of the three-way term and computed whether the amount of additional
variance it explained over and above that of the otherwise full models, was statistically
signiﬁcant. These results are presented in Tables 5 and 6.

4. Findings

Table 3 indicates that the interaction term for OCE1 and information processing is indeed
positive and signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level. Thus Hypothesis 1 is supported. This is conﬁrmed
by the analyses of Table 4, in which the same interaction term, this time for information
processing and OCE2, is again positive and signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.01 level. Thus, even
when using different measures and different respondents, OCE appears to enhance the value
of information processing.

The interaction terms of Tables 3 and 4 show the results of testing our second hypothesis:
namely that collaboration will be rendered more effective by OCE. Here the results are
mixed. Both tables show positive coefﬁcients, but only Table 4 shows a signiﬁcant interac-
tion term (p , 0.01). In other words, this result is sensitive to the way in which OCE is
measured.

Collaboration seems to beneﬁt most from OCE in the form of investments in training and
development, and investments in compensation (OCE2). These are very concrete organiza-
tional responses that create and attract a more talented workforce; one that may be especially
suited to complex collaborative efforts. By contrast, employees who are merely “satisﬁed and
motivated” (the province of OCE1) may not be talented enough to overcome the organiza-
tional boundaries that lie in the path of effective collaboration. It may also be that OCE1,
which taps “concern” for employee well-being and satisfaction, may have less impact on the
quality of collaboration because some executives reporting a high level of “concern” do not
always follow it up with concrete actions.

Tables 3 and 4 support Hypothesis 3: the interaction terms between the initiative dimen-
sion and both OCE1 and OCE2 are positive and signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.05 and 0.01
levels, respectively. Clearly, OCE enhances the value of initiative. To further establish the
robustness of these ﬁndings, we decomposed the information processing and initiative
dimensions into their subcomponents of analysis and scanning, and proactiveness and risk
taking, respectively (see Appendix 1 for the breakdowns). These were the same subcompo-
nents identiﬁed by Miller (1987) in developing his process scales, which were used in this
study. We then repeated the analyses of Tables 3 and 4. In all cases, the scanning, analysis,
proactiveness and risk taking interactions with both OCE1 and OCE2 were positive and

signiﬁcant. In other words, all eight of the eight predicted interaction terms were positive and
signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.05 level (these ﬁndings are available from the ﬁrst author).

Hypothesis 4 suggested that the positive interaction between process and OCE would be
more useful in uncertain than in stable environments. This hypothesis was tested by the
three-way interaction terms added to the full models of Tables 3 and 4, and shown in Tables
5 and 6. All six analyses showed positive interactions, and ﬁve of the six terms were
statistically signiﬁcant (three at beyond the 0.05 level; two at beyond the 0.10 level). As
discussed above, it appears that OCE2—the investment in training and education and in total
compensation—may do slightly more to enhance the quality of collaboration in uncertain
environments than more abstract and symbolic considerations such as fairness, and concern
for employee satisfaction and wellbeing (OCE1).

5. Discussion

Overall, the results are strong. Five of the 6 two-way interaction coefﬁcients based on the
three process dimensions are positive and signiﬁcant in the predicted direction (as well as 8
of 8 interaction terms based on the dimension subcomponents of scanning, analysis, proac-

tiveness and risk taking). Five of the 6 three-way interaction terms—which were added to the
full models already containing the two-way interactions—were signiﬁcant as well (3 at
beyond the 0.05 level). All in all, there is little doubt that, at least in Korean enterprises, a
company’s commitment to its employees can pay off ﬁnancially. However, this is true
mainly if the ﬁrm employs an effective decision making process: OCE1 did not show any
signiﬁcant direct relationship to return on assets, and OCE2 did exhibit such a relationship,
but with modest levels of statistical signiﬁcance. Thus by itself OCE does not appear to have
a very strong direct relationship with performance.

We do not deny that OCE, and some of the progressive HRM practices contained therein,
may indeed have some impact on different aspects of performance. This, in fact, is the claim
of scholars such as Arthur (1994), Delaney and Huselid (1996), Huselid (1995) and Snell and
Youndt (1995). But in our study the direct impact was modest. A key contribution of this
research has been to look inside the “black box”—to make a far stronger connection between
OCE and performance via the mediating construct of decision making. We suspect that it was
largely through its impact on the quality of decision making that OCE drove performance.
There appears then to be a powerful connection between the devotion to the human capital
of an organization and the competence and motivation that enrich decision making processes
such as information processing, collaboration and initiative.

In this study, the dimensions of decision making process did not demonstrate any direct
relationship with performance. As expected, and as suggested by the myriad conﬂicting
ﬁndings in the literature, not one of our process dimensions showed any signiﬁcant effect on
ROA in any of the models. This is very much in line with our contention that it is not the
quantity or extent of information processing, collaboration, or initiative that matters most.
Rather it is the ability and motivation of decision makers to engage in useful information
processing, collaboration and initiatives, that enhances the quality of decisions and helps
performance. This usefulness will be a product of the training and ability of employees, their
motivation to be resourceful, and their willingness to work together and use their talents for
the good of the organization. As previous research has shown, OCE helps to elicit all of these
behaviors.

This ﬁnding is interesting in the light of the debates about whether information processing,
collaboration and initiative are useful qualities of a decision making process (Miller & Cardinal,
1994; Mintzberg, 1994; Noda & Bower, 1996). The ambiguous ﬁndings in the decision making
literature to date suggest that these characteristics may not be very important. Some authors have
advocated that it is the ﬂexibility of the decision making process that is critical (Mintzberg, 1994;
Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998). Certainly ﬂexibility can have real advantages in bringing about
speedy and creative decisions, but it can also lead to impulsive acts and chaotic behavior. And
while structured and formal approaches to decision making may foster rigidity, they can also
target people towards key priorities, ensure that they “cover the bases,” and encourage thorough
but efﬁcient decision making that is a source of real competitive advantage. In other words, we
believe that it is not so much the formality or ﬂexibility of decision making as the talents, training
and motivations of those making the decisions that are most critical for performance. But this
clearly is an issue for further research.

We believe too that OCE-induced improvements in information processing, collaboration
and initiative not only have a direct effect on the quality of decisions and performance, they

also lead in the long run to far more potent and sensitive organizational learning processes.
Effective learning relies on appropriate scanning and analysis of information, collaboration
to exchange and validate information and construct different conceptual models, and exper-
imental initiatives to learn about the environment and test new courses of action (Fiol, 1994;
Nonaka, 1996; Senge, 1990). We have found that every one of these activities beneﬁts from
the investment in human capital represented by OCE. And that, perhaps, is why OCE seems
to be making an especially important contribution to the efﬁcacy of the decision making
process in uncertain environments (Fiol, 1994). It is there that organizational learning is of
paramount concern, and also rather urgent (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998).

We would like to see more research into such connections. Speciﬁcally, given the
divergent ﬁndings for OCE1 and OCE2, it would be useful to know just which aspects of
OCE—training, compensation, human consideration, reward sharing— have the greatest
impact on decision making and organizational learning. Also it is important to determine
which characteristics of decision makers and decision making are most affected by these
inﬂuences—and how. For example, what are the impacts of the different components of OCE
on social skills, motivation, self-conﬁdence, team learning, creative options generation, and
so forth? And at what levels of the organization—and in which competitive contexts—are
these inﬂuences most crucial to performance? It is such ﬁner grained research that may tell
us why OCE1 was an inferior facilitator of collaboration than OCE2.

More broadly, we would like to see more work that bridges the schism between macro and
micro approaches to decision making (e.g., Ostroff, 1993; Ryan, Smith & Johnson, 1996).
Many micro studies have failed to interest managers because their results have not been
shown to have an impact on organizational performance. At the same time macro level
analyses, by failing to focus on the human element, have been plagued by misspeciﬁed
models and noncumulative results. By combining macro and micro perspectives we hope
researchers will be able to derive results that not only help corporate performance, but also
make for a more humane, digniﬁed, and gratifying work environment.

Further research also needs to be undertaken to determine whether our own ﬁndings will
generalize to other nations and cultures. It is important to bear in mind that this is a study of
Korean companies. In Korea, the Confucian ethic makes it especially important for ﬁrms to
display care for their employees; indeed such care is widely held to be an important
responsibility of employers. It may also be true that Korean workers respond especially well
to commitment from their companies—that the Confucian ethic demands reciprocation from
employees in the form of greater effort and dedication to the group. These conditions render
Korean ﬁrms ideal venues for supporting our hypotheses. It will therefore be important to test
the notions of this paper on American and European organizations to establish the generality
of our ﬁndings.
