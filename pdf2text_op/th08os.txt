Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on
Performance: The Role of Process Conformance

Zeynep Ton, Robert S. Huckman

Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts 02163

{zton@hbs.edu, rhuckman@hbs.edu}

We examine the impact of employee turnover on operating performance in settings that require high levels of knowledge

exploitation. Using 48 months of turnover data from U.S. stores of a major retail chain, we ﬁnd that, on average,
employee turnover is associated with decreased performance, as measured by proﬁt margin and customer service. The effect
of turnover on performance, however, is mitigated by the nature of management at the store level. The particular aspect of
management on which we focus is process conformance—the extent to which managers aim to reduce variation in store
operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. At high-process-conformance stores,
managers use discipline in implementing standardized policies and procedures, whereas at low-process-conformance stores,
managers tolerate deviations from these standards. We ﬁnd that increasing turnover does not have a negative effect on
store performance at high-process-conformance stores; at low-process-conformance stores, the negative effect of turnover
is pronounced. Our results suggest that, in settings where performance depends on the repetition of known tasks, managers
can reduce turnover’s effect by imposing process discipline through standard operating procedures.

Key words: employee turnover; process management; knowledge exploitation; retail operations

Introduction

1.
Employee turnover in organizations has received sub-
stantial attention from both academics and managers.
Much of this attention has been focused on understand-
ing its causes. Implicit in this approach is the assumption
that turnover is driven by certain identiﬁable character-
istics of workers, tasks, ﬁrms, and markets, and that, by
developing policies to address these characteristics, man-
agers might reduce the occurrence of turnover in their
respective organizations. As noted by several observers,
however, the consequences of turnover have received
signiﬁcantly less attention from researchers (Staw 1980,
Mobley 1982, Glebbeek and Bax 2004). This lack of
academic attention is particularly surprising given that
industry studies have estimated the cost of turning over
one employee earning $8 per hour at $3,500 to $25,000.1
In this paper, we address this latter issue through empir-
ical examination of the impact of turnover on operating
performance at stores in a large retail chain.

We focus our empirical analysis on the retail industry
for several reasons. First, retail accounts for a substan-
tial portion of employment in the United States. Accord-
ing to the National Retail Federation, in 2003 retailers
in the United States employed more than 23 million
people, nearly one out of every ﬁve American work-
ers. Second, most retailers operate with very high levels
of employee turnover, which makes retailing an impor-
tant context in which to study this phenomenon. Finally,
retail provides a setting in which performance tends to

depend on the repetition of known tasks rather than
on innovation. The difference between repetition and
innovation evokes March’s (1991) distinction between
exploitation and exploration. The relevance of this dis-
tinction is addressed in the development of our hypothe-
ses later in this paper.

Our ﬁrst objective is to determine the magnitude
and direction of turnover’s effect on operating perfor-
mance in settings characterized by knowledge exploita-
tion. Prior research on this question has offered mixed
conclusions based on both theoretical and empirical
analysis. For example, while many have argued that
turnover has negative effects on operating performance
due to the disruption of existing routines (Dalton and
Todor 1979, Bluedorn 1982) or the loss of an employee’s
accumulated experience (Argote and Epple 1990, Nelson
and Winter 1982, Polanyi 1966), others have suggested
that ﬁrms may beneﬁt from the innovative thinking or
increased motivation that new workers bring to a job
(Abelson and Baysinger 1984, Mowday et al. 1982, Staw
1980). These conﬂicting views suggest that the effect of
turnover on performance may depend on the nature of
the environment in which turnover occurs.

Our second objective is to examine whether managers
can mitigate the effect of turnover on operating perfor-
mance. This question is particularly relevant for settings
that operate with high levels of turnover. The aspect of
management in which we are most interested is pro-
cess conformance—the extent to which managers aim to

reduce variation in store operations in accordance with
a set of prescribed standards for task performance.

Our study design takes advantage of the fact that we
are able to examine longitudinal observations of store-
level performance across sites that are owned and oper-
ated by the same parent company. We are thus able to
control for ﬁrm-level characteristics (e.g., employment
policies, training procedures, etc.) that may otherwise
confound a multiﬁrm analysis of turnover’s impact on
performance. As part of their common ownership, all of
the stores in this chain are instructed to follow the same
standards for task performance. The extent to which
store managers enforce these standards, however, varies
across sites. We take advantage of this variation in the
degree of process conformance across otherwise simi-
lar stores to examine the extent to which the impact of
turnover can be managed.

Using data from 268 stores over 48 months, we show
that, on average, turnover is associated with decreased
store performance, as measured by proﬁt margin and
customer service. These average effects are not large.
We also show that turnover has a nonlinear effect on per-
formance, with low-turnover stores being more affected
by turnover
than high-turnover stores. Finally, we
ﬁnd that, at high-process-conformance stores, turnover
does not decrease store performance, whereas at low-
process-conformance stores,
turnover does decrease
store performance.

This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses
the theoretical motivation for our hypotheses. Section 3
describes the empirical setting, data and measures, and
empirical models. Section 4 presents and discusses our
results, and §5 concludes.

2. Theoretical Motivation
As mentioned above, the prior literature on the effects
of turnover provides a mixed picture in terms of both
theory and empirical results. Several studies suggest that
turnover decreases operating performance. While rec-
ognizing the possibility of an optimal rate of turnover,
Huselid (1995) assumes that low rates of turnover are
preferable to high rates. Glebbeek and Bax (2004) refer
to Huselid’s claim as the “conventional assumption of
turnover research” (p. 279).

Much of this negative effect stems from the direct
costs of turnover, such as those involved with severance
and the recruitment and training of new employees (Staw
1980, Darmon 1990, Hom and Griffeth 1995). In addi-
tion, turnover has been associated with several indirect
costs. First, ﬁrms may experience operational disrup-
tion (Staw 1980, Mobley 1982) following the depar-
ture of key employees. This could be due to either the
loss of the ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital that resides in
departing employees (Becker 1962) or the loss of the
social capital embedded in workers’ relationships to each

other and the organization (Leana and Van Buren 1999,
Dess and Shaw 2001). A second source of indirect costs
is the demoralization of employees who remain with
a ﬁrm (Staw 1980, Steers and Mowday 1981, Mobley
1982). This demoralization may be due to the loss of a
respected colleague or the fact that turnover may require
additional work to be absorbed by remaining employ-
ees whose capacity is already stretched (Mowday et al.
1982).

Despite substantial evidence regarding turnover’s neg-
ative consequences for ﬁrms, several studies—including
many of those above—note offsetting positive effects.
For example, the economic perspective on turnover sug-
gests that
turnover reﬂects the beneﬁcial aspects of
worker mobility, such as the improvement of matches
between employees and ﬁrms over time (Jovanovic
1979). Organizational psychologists have also claimed
that workers’ efforts may be highest when they ﬁrst
join an organization and may decrease over time (Staw
1980). These conﬂicting views concerning the effects
of turnover suggest that one must not view turnover
as a monolithic concept, but rather as a contingent
phenomenon. The relevant question thus becomes not
whether turnover has positive or negative effects on
performance, but rather under what conditions it
is
more harmful or beneﬁcial to the ﬁrm (Osterman 1987).
Numerous studies have examined the dimensions along
which turnover’s impact on performance may vary.
These dimensions include the absolute level of turnover
itself (Bluedorn 1982, Abelson and Baysinger 1984),
the degree to which the departing employee is respected
by his colleagues who remain with the ﬁrm (Mowday
et al. 1982), the departing employee’s tenure with the
ﬁrm (Staw 1980), the degree to which turnover is vol-
untary for the worker (Bluedorn 1982), the degree to
which turnover is predictable (Price 1977, Staw 1980),
and the organizational structure of the ﬁrm in which
turnover occurs (Carley 1992, Argote 1999, Rao and
Argote 2006).

One of the most commonly noted moderators of
turnover’s effect on performance is the nature of the
task being performed. Most studies considering the mod-
erating role of task characteristics draw on some vari-
ant of the distinction that is clearly stated in March’s
(1991) comparison: “between the exploration of new
possibilities and the exploitation of old certainties”
(p. 71, emphasis added). March suggests that, in situa-
tions involving exploration, the addition of novice work-
ers may actually increase knowledge levels within the
ﬁrm—not because of the expertise of these new workers,
but rather because of the increased variety of perspec-
tives they introduce to the organization.

Several studies provide support for the beneﬁts of
turnover in settings requiring exploration or innovation.
Dalton and Todor (1979) and Staw (1980) note that
the worker mobility implied by turnover may serve as

a source of new knowledge for ﬁrms. Furthermore, an
experimental study by Argote et al. (1995) ﬁnds that,
although the average effect of turnover on work group
performance is negative, this effect is less pronounced
for complex tasks than for simple tasks. They attribute
this difference in turnover’s effect to the fact that the per-
formance of complex tasks requires greater innovation
(i.e., exploration) than simpler tasks requiring repetition
(i.e., exploitation).

We maintain that performance in retail chain settings,
such as the setting considered in this study, is more
accurately characterized as requiring exploitation than
exploration. We refer to March’s choice of terms to
describe exploitation (e.g., reﬁnement, production, efﬁ-
ciency,
implementation, execution) versus exploration
(e.g., search, variation, risk taking, experimentation,
discovery,
innovation) (March 1991). As Winter and
Szulanski (2001) also argue, companies that operate
multiple units often evolve from a phase of exploration
during which they experiment with different approaches,
to a phase of exploitation during which they “freeze the
design” and replicate the established approaches. As a
result, the performance at mature retail chains is highly
dependent on the successful execution of known activi-
ties such as processing of incoming inventory, shelving
merchandise, responding to customer queries, and trans-
acting sales on the cash registers.

In this environment, we expect employee turnover to
have a negative effect on ﬁrm performance due to oper-
ational disruption from employee departures, additional
work that must be absorbed by remaining employees,
and the loss of tacit knowledge and accumulated experi-
ence held by departing employees. While activities such
as shelving merchandise may beneﬁt from increased
effort of new employees, we expect this positive effect to
be outweighed by the negative effects of turnover. Based
on this characterization and the prior literature, we arrive
at our ﬁrst hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1. In settings requiring high levels of
knowledge exploitation, turnover will, on average, have
a negative effect on operating performance.

To the extent that the hypothesized negative effect
of turnover on operating performance in exploitation-
based settings exists, we are interested in understand-
ing the tools that managers might use to mitigate these
effects. Below, we argue that one management lever in
this regard is process conformance—the degree to which
managers aim to reduce variation in operations in accor-
dance with a set of prescribed standards for task perfor-
mance. This concept is similar to notions of attention to
detail and adherence to rules and procedures (Naveh and
Erez 2004). Several researchers claim that a process con-
formance approach may be appropriate in settings that
produce standardized products or services (Levitt 1972,

Bowen and Lawler 1992, Adler and Cole 1993, Sitkin
et al. 1994, Bowen and Lawler 1995, Adler et al. 1999).
In support of the role of process conformance in mit-
igating turnover’s effect on performance, Argote and
Epple (1990) state that “turnover may matter more in
organizations where jobs are not standardized and pro-
cedures do not exist for transmitting knowledge to new
members” (p. 922). In motivating our second hypothesis,
we note that this quote uses the word “may,” suggest-
ing that the role of such standardization in mitigating
turnover’s negative effects merits empirical examination.
We also stress a point that is important to our analysis,
though not addressed in the above quote—that standard-
ization is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for
process conformance. In our setting, the level of stan-
dardization as designated by the corporate ofﬁce is the
same at all 268 stores, each of which is instructed to
follow the policies and procedures described in the 334-
page corporate manual. Because the chain uses central-
ized planning, compliance with standards is important
from the perspective of the corporate ofﬁce. The extent
to which store managers enforce these standards, how-
ever, differs considerably across sites. While some store
managers are quite disciplined in implementing these
prescribed standards (high-process-conformance stores)
others are more tolerant of deviations from these stan-
dards (low-process-conformance stores).

In our retail setting, to the extent that stores operate
with a high degree of process conformance, we expect
that knowledge concerning task performance will be
transferred more easily to new employees (i.e., it will
be less likely to be lost when employees depart). This
expectation leads to our second hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2. In settings requiring high levels of
the level of process confor-
knowledge exploitation,
mance will moderate the impact of turnover on operat-
ing performance. In particular, stores with lower levels
of process conformance will be more negatively affected
by turnover than stores with higher levels of process
conformance.

3. Research Design
3.1. Empirical Setting
We test our hypotheses using data from Borders Group
(Borders), a Fortune 500 retailer of entertainment prod-
ucts such as books, CDs, and DVDs. At the end of 2003,
Borders operated 445 superstores (under the name Bor-
ders) and about 720 mall-based stores (under the name
Waldenbooks), and employed approximately 32,000 peo-
ple. In this study, we focus solely on Borders super-
stores (hereafter called Borders stores). Like most retail-
ers, Borders stores experience high levels of employee
turnover. Between 1999 and 2002, the average annual
full-time employee turnover across Borders stores ranged
from 49% to 69%, and the average annual part-time
employee turnover ranged from 94% to 114%.

Borders stores provide an ideal setting in which to
examine whether the impact of turnover on performance
can be moderated by process conformance. Because
Borders uses centralized merchandise planning, it has
developed standard operating procedures across all of
its stores. This standardization supports customer ser-
vice efforts at the store level. For example, computer
terminals at Borders stores allow customers to check the
availability and location of speciﬁc books. The success
of this system depends on books being shelved in spe-
ciﬁc sections, as prescribed by the corporate standards.
The shelving standards, as well as other standard oper-
ating procedures, are described in a 334-page policy and
process handbook. Although all stores are instructed to
conform to these standards, we observed during our store
visits that the extent of conformance varies across sites.
While some store managers impose discipline in con-
forming to prescribed standards, others tolerate devia-
tions. For example, at one store, in violation of shelving
standards salespeople organized art books by artist rather
than by author. The manager of that store noted

we don’t shelve art books like other Borders stores do.
Our salespeople are extremely brainy. Other stores don’t
shelve by artist, they shelve by author. Like some of titles
up there, I don’t know which artists they are and look in
the computer, and it’s like a Degas book, and I wouldn’t
know that by looking at it, but the salespeople know.
So they put titles with Degas that don’t have the word
“Degas” in the name. They do that with biographies as
well. If a biography doesn’t have a name of a person
they will know that and say, “Hey, this is a biography
about this person. I’m going to shelve it with this per-
son’s work.”
At another store, salespeople placed overstocked
books underneath display tables on the selling ﬂoor
instead of placing them in appropriate storage areas.
Similar to the above example, the store manager was
well aware of this violation and even encouraged it, as
she thought it saved her salespeople time in restocking
shelves.

This approach, however, was not consistent across
stores. In fact, we asked another store manager why
he did not encourage his employees to deviate from
shelving standards when they disagreed with them. He
replied, “That’s exactly how books get lost at a store.” In
a related vein, a ﬁve-year employee at another store told
us that, while she often did not agree with the shelving
standards, it was clear to her that she was expected to
follow them. While picking up the new merchandise that
arrived at the store, she pointed at two books that were
related to the bestselling book The Da Vinci Code, and
observed

this one goes to “Christianity,” but this one is in “meta-
physical.” See, that’s another dumb thing. We don’t keep
them together in sections. This is not our thinking, but
this is what we are asked to do. The label says Christian-
ity, so I’ll put it in Christianity.

3.2. Data and Measures
Our sample includes data from all 268 Borders stores
that opened before August 1999. We obtained monthly
turnover and performance data for each store from 1999
to 2002. Below, we describe our measures of store per-
formance, employee turnover, and process conformance.
We then describe our empirical analysis and the asso-
ciated control variables. Summary statistics and simple
correlations among all variables used in our analysis are
provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. We note that
Table 2 should be interpreted with caution, as it uses
pooled observations from the 268 sites across 48 time
periods.

3.2.1.

Store Performance. We examine turnover’s
effect on two measures of store performance. The ﬁrst,
customer service score, is a subjective measure. Each
store is shopped once a month by a mystery shopper.
These shoppers ﬁll out a form that includes approxi-
mately 50 questions about the store environment and
customer service interactions.2

A store’s overall customer service score is based on
the mystery shopper’s answers to these questions. Our
second performance measure, proﬁt margin (operating
income divided by sales), is an objective measure of
ﬁnancial performance. We prefer this measure to other
measures of ﬁnancial performance, such as total sales or
total proﬁt, as these latter measures are affected by the
absolute level of activity at the store. In many instances,
the absolute level of activity depends on factors that
are beyond the control of the store manager, such as
weather conditions, corporate promotions, author sign-
ings, or idiosyncratic special events. Because it is dif-
ﬁcult to account for the impact of all of these external
factors, we use proﬁt margin as a performance measure
that controls for differences in the absolute level of activ-
ity across stores.

3.2.2. Employee Turnover. Employees voluntarily
leave Borders stores for a variety of reasons including
career changes, geographical moves, pursuit of educa-
tional opportunities, or retirement. As shown in Figure 1,
across all Borders stores, employee turnover tends to be
highest during the month of August due to employees’
leaving Borders to return to school.

Given the nature of the performance measures we
observe, we focus on turnover of employees who per-
form day-to-day operational activities at the stores and
exclude employees who are engaged in ofﬁce coordi-
nation or community relations activities. In addition,
we focus solely on permanent employees. Like most
retailers, Borders hires temporary employees during
high-trafﬁc periods (e.g., holiday shopping in Decem-
ber). These temporary employees are excluded in our
In addition, Borders reports employees’
measures.3
departures only when they leave the company perma-
nently. Consequently, our turnover measures do not track
store transfers. Finally, we note that most turnover at
Borders stores is voluntary. Though we would have
liked to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary
turnover, we were not able to obtain the data required to
make such distinctions.

We calculate the turnover rate in a particular period
as the number of employees who left a store during
that period divided by the average number of employees
working at the store during that period. While there are
several other methods for calculating employee turnover
(Mobley 1982, Price 1977), our measure is widely used
and allows for comparability to earlier ﬁndings (Price

1977, Glebbeek and Bax 2004, Shaw et al. 2005). As
shown in Table 1, average monthly full-time turnover
in our sample is 4.4%, while average monthly part-time
turnover is 7.5%.

3.2.3. Process Conformance. To assess the level of
process conformance at stores, we use two measures
that are regularly tracked by Borders management. The
ﬁrst measure, internally called store conditions, is taken
quarterly and measures conformance to a wide range of
processes. The second measure, internally called returns
pull list, or RPL, is taken monthly and measures confor-
mance to a speciﬁc process. Below we describe each of
the measures and explain how we use them to create a
composite measure of process conformance.

3.2.4.

Store Conditions. Borders classiﬁes its stores
into different regions, each of which is led by a regional
manager. Regional managers regularly make store vis-
its to assess the performance of stores and to set goals
for store managers. Once a quarter, each store’s regional
manager also performs a thorough inspection of its con-
formance to a wide range of processes. The inspec-
tion covers four categories: books, café, music and
video, and store operations. Each category is divided
into multiple sections. For example, the book category
is divided into ﬁve sections: alphabetization, shelf orga-
nization, endcaps, overstock, and product ﬂow. Each of
these sections is further divided into different items. The
alphabetization section, for example,
includes overall
alphabetization, category-critical alphabetization, biog-
raphy alphabetization, and alphabetization when an
author has multiple books.

Stores receive a score for each of the items. The aver-
age of these scores determines the score for the speciﬁc
section. Speciﬁc section scores are ﬁrst multiplied by a
weighting scale and then added up to create the total
store conditions score.

3.2.5. Returns Pull List. The second component of
our composite measure of process conformance is a
store’s RPL score. In this setting, retailers are allowed
to return unsold books to the publishers for a full refund
minus the costs of shipping and handling. Processing
returns is a major task at Borders stores: a typical
store returns approximately 110,000 units, or 40% of its
inventory, every year. At the beginning of each month,
Borders’s corporate ofﬁce sends a returns list to each
store. The standard operating procedures require stores
to return all books on the list to the retailer’s distribu-
tion centers by the end of the month. At the end of each
returns period, the stores receive a returns conformance
score (internally called an RPL score), based on the
number of units returned divided by the total number of
units that were supposed to be returned. The returns pro-
cess, described in detail in the policy and process book,
involves ﬁnding the books, packing them, and shipping
them to the distribution centers.

RPL scores do not affect stores’ short-term ﬁnancial
performance because inventory management is central-
ized at Borders. Because stores do not pay for the books
they carry, they do not receive a payment when they
return the books. In addition, RPL performance is not
used by corporate management to evaluate store man-
ager performance. Consequently, maximizing the RPL
score is not necessarily a high priority for store man-
agers. Precisely because RPL is not a high priority, it
reﬂects the degree to which store managers place empha-
sis on process conformance. In this sense, RPL is similar
to activities such as preventative machine maintenance

in manufacturing plants. Preventative maintenance often
is neither tracked nor used to evaluate plant perfor-
mance, nor used to compensate plant managers. It does,
however, reﬂect managerial attention to process con-
formance; managers who place the greatest emphasis
on process conformance are likely to ensure that pre-
ventative maintenance is performed as scheduled, while
those who are less concerned with process conformance
may sacriﬁce preventative maintenance for other press-
ing tasks at
like preventative
maintenance, although returning books does not have an
immediate effect on performance, it may have a longer-
term and indirect effect on store performance. Removing
books that do not sell well from the selling ﬂoor allows
stores to use the limited shelf space for books that sell
better, presumably leading to higher sales.

the plant. In addition,

3.2.6. Composite Measure of Process Conformance.
To develop our composite measure of process con-
formance, we use the average store conditions score
and the average RPL score for each store for each
year.4 Using these scores, we calculate the mean and
standard deviation of store conditions and RPL scores
across all Borders stores for each year. For each store,
we then standardize the yearly store conditions and
RPL scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by
the standard deviation. We combine these standardized
scores to create the composite process conformance
measure. Using this measure, we rank stores and divide
them into high-process-conformance and low-process-
conformance stores. We use these two categories—
rather than using process conformance as a continuous
variable—to account for the fact that process confor-
mance is a proxy for high and low levels of process
conformance rather than a precise measure of this under-
lying variable. As such, we are reluctant to suggest that

small variations in process conformance scores repre-
sent a meaningfully different level of process confor-
mance. Furthermore, our simple categorization simpli-
ﬁes the interpretation of our empirical results.

3.3. Empirical Model
We estimate the following equation using ordinary least
squares (OLS) to test for the effect of employee turnover
on various dimensions of store performance:

Performanceimy

= (cid:1)i + (cid:3)y + (cid:5)m + (cid:7)1 Employee Turnoverimy

+ Ximy(cid:7)2 + (cid:9)imy(cid:10)

(1)

We estimate versions of (1) using several different mea-
sures of employee turnover. In our initial model, we use
separate variables for part-time and full-time turnover.
Given the similarity between the tasks performed by
these two types of employees in this setting, we also
estimate (1) using a single turnover measure for both
types of workers, which we refer to as total turnover.
Regardless of whether we split or combine full- and
part-time turnover, we measure each value in two ways.
First, we measure turnover over the one-month period
ranging from the 15th day of the prior month to the
15th day of the current month. We use this time period
due to the uncertainty surrounding the speed with which
one would expect turnover to affect performance. Using
turnover lagged by one month may be misleading if
the effects of turnover occur immediately. Alternatively,
using turnover in the current month would be problem-
atic if performance effects occur with a lag. We use our
measure as a compromise between these two extremes.
To address concerns about the potential noise in monthly
levels of turnover, we also estimate our models using a
measure of turnover during the prior three months.

In addition to employee turnover, (1) includes a vec-
tor, Ximy, that contains several store-level variables that
vary over time. These include an indicator for turnover
by store managers during the current month (to con-
trol for management changes);5 full-time employees as
a percentage of total employees (to control for employee
mix); total store payroll (to control for the total amount
of labor used by the store); the number of competitors
in the local market;6 and the unemployment rate in the
store’s metropolitan statistical area (to control for labor
supply).7 We would have liked to control for average
employee tenure at the store. We were not able, however,
to obtain these data from the company.

This speciﬁcation also includes ﬁxed effects for each
store (cid:11)(cid:1)i(cid:12), each year (cid:11)(cid:3)y(cid:12) from 1999 to 2002, and each
month (cid:11)(cid:5)m(cid:12) of the calendar year. Store ﬁxed effects con-
trol for time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity across
stores8 (Hausman and Taylor 1981), which might oth-
erwise affect both employee turnover and store perfor-
mance, leading to biased estimates. The year effects

control for changes over time in factors such as eco-
nomic conditions and corporate policies, while the
calendar-month effects control for seasonality.

To make sure that turnover is not endogenous to per-
formance, we asked store managers, store employees,
and corporate managers what drives turnover at Borders
stores. None of the managers we interviewed mentioned
poor store performance as a driver of employee turnover.
Furthermore, they noted that involuntary turnover due
to the poor performance of individual employees is
quite rare. Finally, several of our empirical models use
lagged measures of turnover to reduce concerns of endo-
geneity. Nevertheless, to test whether employee turnover
remains endogenous, we examine the effect of past store
performance on employee turnover. We use one-month
and two-month lags for both customer service and proﬁt
margin. The results, not reported in our paper, show no
evidence of signiﬁcant effect of either measure of store
performance on employee turnover. The absence of sig-
niﬁcant effects in the reverse regressions is reassuring,
and suggests that we need not be overly concerned about
the exogeneity of our turnover measure.

Several have hypothesized that

the relationship
between employee turnover and performance is nonlin-
ear (Price 1977, Bluedorn 1982). To determine whether
the effect of turnover on performance depends on the
level of turnover at the stores, we estimate models in
which we interact monthly turnover with two categories
for the average level of turnover—high and low—at the
stores. This model appears below:

Performanceimy

= (cid:1)i + (cid:3)y + (cid:5)m + (cid:7)1 Employee Turnoverimy

+ (cid:7)2 Employee Turnoverimy
∗ High TurnoverimyXimy(cid:7)4 + (cid:9)imy(cid:10)

(2)

The high- and low-turnover categories were assigned by
ranking and dividing the stores into halves based on their
turnover in each year. We also estimate versions of (2)
where we divide stores into three categories based on
their yearly turnover performance—high, medium, and
low. The results (not reported in this paper) are very
similar to those using two categories.

Finally, to determine whether process conformance
moderates the relationship between turnover and per-
formance, we estimate models in which the level of
employee turnover is interacted with the two categories
of process conformance—high and low. This model
appears below:

Performanceimy
= (cid:1)i + (cid:3)y + (cid:5)m + (cid:7)1 Employee Turnoverimy
+ (cid:7)2 Employee Turnoverimy
∗High Process Conformanceiy+Ximy(cid:7)4+(cid:9)imy(cid:10)

As a test of robustness, we also estimate a version of (3)
where we divide stores into three categories based on
their yearly process conformance performance—high,
medium, and low. In addition, we also estimate versions
of (3) where we use yearly RPL scores, yearly store con-
ditions scores, and variations in RPL as single measures
of process conformance.9

4. Results and Discussion
4.1. Average Effect of Turnover on Performance

4.1.1. Customer Service. Table 3 presents the esti-
mates for our basic model with customer service score as
the dependent variable. Columns 1 and 2 suggest that, on
average, monthly turnover has a negative, but insigniﬁ-
cant, impact on customer service. When turnover is mea-
sured over the prior three months, however, the effects
remain negative and are signiﬁcant at conventional levels
(Columns 3 and 4). In terms of magnitude, these effects

deviation is 2.41%, relative to the average proﬁt margin,
and amounts to $11,700 of lost proﬁt per store per year.
This seemingly modest negative effect on proﬁt margin,
however, is economically signiﬁcant for the company.
A loss of $11,700 proﬁt per store amounts to a total
loss of $3.1 million for 268 stores, or approximately
6% of the net income that came from Borders stores in
1999.11

Although our ﬁndings are sensitive to the length of
time over which turnover is observed, the results from
Tables 3 and 4 provide some support for Hypothesis 1.
Using turnover rates for the prior three months, on aver-
age, turnover has a negative effect on both measures of
store performance. We note that the results using sepa-
rate measures of full- and part-time turnover and a single
measure of total turnover are very similar. In subsequent
sections, we discuss our results using the measure of
total turnover only.

measures of turnover, we ﬁnd that the impact of turnover
on performance is negative at low-turnover stores for
both customer service and proﬁt margin. Using customer
service as the dependent variable, high-turnover stores
show an effect of turnover that is 8.1 points greater than
the effect for low-turnover stores using monthly mea-
sures of turnover. The combined effect of turnover of
4.33 (=−3(cid:10)72 + 8(cid:10)05) for high-turnover stores is not
signiﬁcantly different from zero. Similarly, using proﬁt
margin as the dependent variable, high-turnover stores
show effects of turnover that are 0.06 and 0.02 percent-
age points greater than the effect for low-turnover stores
using monthly and three-month measures of turnover,
respectively. Again, the combined effects of turnover
for high-turnover stores are not signiﬁcantly different
from zero. Overall, our results show that
the effect
of turnover on performance is worse for low-turnover
stores than for high-turnover stores. This is consistent
with Price’s (1977) prediction and a recent empirical
study of turnover in the trucking and concrete pipe
industries (Shaw et al. 2005).

4.3. Moderating Effect of Process Conformance
Table 6 presents estimates of (3) with customer service
and proﬁt margin as the dependent variable.12 Regardless
of whether we use customer service (Columns 1 and 2)
or proﬁt margin (Columns 3 and 4) as the performance
variable, our results are similar. The effect of turnover
for low-process conformance stores is negative and sig-
niﬁcant. This negative effect is offset as we move to
stores with high levels of process conformance. Using
both monthly and three-month measures of turnover, the
effects for high-process conformance stores are signif-
icantly higher than those for low-process conformance
stores. The combined effects for the high- conformance
group are not signiﬁcantly different from zero in any
of the four columns. For example, when using monthly
turnover, and examining the effect of turnover on cus-
tomer service,
for
high-process conformance stores of 4.431 (=−7(cid:10)777 +
12(cid:10)208) in Column 1 is not signiﬁcantly different from
zero. Note that we obtained very similar results when
we divided stores into high-, medium-, and low-process
conformance categories.

turnover

In Table 7, we report results in which we replace our
composite measure of process conformance with three
separate measures of process conformance—high yearly
RPL scores, high yearly store conditions scores, and
high variation in RPL. The ﬁrst two measures were cre-
ated by ranking stores with respect to their yearly RPL
and yearly store condition scores and dividing them into
high- and low-RPL and high- and low-store conditions
categories, respectively. Regardless of whether we use
high-RPL or high-store conditions, we obtain similar
results. The effect of turnover on both customer service
and proﬁt margin for stores that are in low categories is

negative and signiﬁcant. This negative effect is offset as
we move to stores in the high categories. These similar
results with models based on the individual components
of our composite measure provide support for our main
ﬁndings.

We add the third measure—high variation in RPL—
under the assumption that stores with high levels of pro-
cess conformance will be characterized not only by high
RPL levels but also by low variation in RPL levels across
time. We divide stores into high- and low-variation RPL
categories using the standard deviation of their monthly
RPL scores in a year. As reported in Columns 3 and 6
of Table 7, the effect of turnover for stores in the low-
variation RPL category is negative and signiﬁcant. This
negative effect is even more pronounced for stores that
are in the high-variation RPL category, supporting our
hypothesis that the effect of turnover is worse for low-
conformance stores.

5. Conclusion
The ﬁrst objective of this study is to examine the effect
of turnover on operating performance in settings that
require high levels of knowledge exploitation (March

1991). Our longitudinal analysis of Borders stores shows
that, on average, increased employee turnover is asso-
ciated with decreased store performance, as measured
by customer service score and proﬁt margin. Consis-
tent with Price (1977), we also ﬁnd that turnover has
a nonlinear effect on performance, with low-turnover
stores being more affected by turnover
than their
high-turnover counterparts. At low-turnover stores, the
average employee has a high level of accumulated expe-
rience. Consequently, an employee’s departure would be
expected to have a large effect on performance because
the store loses an employee with substantial experience.
At high-turnover stores, however, the average employee
has a lower level of accumulated experience. As such,
employee turnover would be expected to have a smaller
effect on store performance because turnover simply
replaces one inexperienced employee with another.

The second objective of our work is to contribute to
the study of employee turnover as a contingent phe-
nomenon. Our analysis shows that the effect of turnover
on operating performance is mitigated by the nature of
store management. Speciﬁcally, the negative effect of
turnover on performance is more pronounced at stores
where managers choose a low-process-conformance
approach. For example, an increase of one standard devi-
ation in total
turnover at a low-process-conformance
store leads to a 3.8% decrease in proﬁt margin. However,
at high-process-conformance stores, where employees
consistently follow prescribed standard operating proce-
dures, increasing turnover does not lead to a decrease in
store performance.

We claim that, at high-process-conformance stores,
there is a consistent approach to task performance and, as
a result, knowledge resides in existing routines (Nelson
and Winter 1982) at those sites. It is, therefore, easier to
transfer knowledge to new employees, and the disruption
of existing routines following an employee departure
is small (Argote 1999). At
low-process-conformance
stores, however, there is greater variation across employ-
ees in how tasks are performed. As a result, knowledge
resides in employees rather than in organizational rou-
tines. The knowledge of these workers is thus likely to
be lost when they leave the ﬁrm.

Our study has implications for managing knowl-
edge in organizations. Our ﬁndings suggest that stor-
ing knowledge in organizational routines rather than in
employees represents one approach to mitigating the
negative consequences of turnover on organizational per-
formance. This approach may be particularly effective in
exploitation-oriented settings that experience high levels
of turnover.

Like most studies of this type, ours is not without
its caveats. First, we examine a single ﬁrm in a single
industry. As a result, our ﬁndings may not generalize to
other settings, even those characterized by similar levels
of knowledge exploitation. Nonetheless, our focus on a

single ﬁrm allows us to avoid having to control for het-
erogeneity across stores in ownership. We thus avoid
having to control for unobservable ﬁrm-level factors that
are correlated with both performance and turnover. Fur-
thermore, our ﬁndings may be applied to other forms of
retailing as well as to other settings—such as call cen-
ters, hospitals, and food services—that operate with high
levels of employee turnover. According to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics (2005a), employee turnover rates in
the retail industry and in the accommodation and food
services industries were 55.1% and 75.4%, respectively,
in 2005.13 These turnover rates include turnover of all
employees (e.g., workers who perform daily operational
activities as well as managers and assistant managers).
Turnover rates for workers who perform operational
activities are likely to be even higher. At many fast-food
chains, for example, employee turnover rates of 200% a
year for hourly workers are common (White 2005). Fur-
thermore, workers performing daily operational activi-
ties in these industries represent a signiﬁcant portion of
the workforce in the United States.14

Second, we cannot distinguish between voluntary and
involuntary turnover. Borders managers maintain that
most turnover at their stores is voluntary and, as a result,
they do not systematically track the causes of turnover for
store employees. To the extent that involuntary turnover

and process conformance are correlated, the moderating
effect of process conformance may be partly due to the
involuntary nature of turnover at these stores. Although
we do not have any reason to believe that there is more
involuntary turnover at high-process-conformance stores,
we are not able to test this relationship with our data.

Third, our data do not allow us to determine whether a
store’s level of process conformance is the result of man-
agerial policy or employee will. For example, we are not
able to observe whether a store has low process confor-
mance because its manager decides not to enforce corpo-
rate standards or because its frontline employees decide
not to act in accordance with mandates from the store
manager. Regardless of the underlying cause of low con-
formance, our study highlights the impact of its occur-
rence on the effect that turnover has on performance.

Fourth, it is possible that there is an alternative expla-
nation of our results. Speciﬁcally, employees at stores
with low process conformance may be more skilled in
selling books and interacting with customers than they
are in following standardized processes. Because these
employees directly affect customer service, and thus
sales and proﬁt, their departure may disproportionately
hurt operational performance at stores with low process
conformance. This explanation is unlikely in our setting.
We ﬁnd that stores with high process conformance have

higher average customer service scores than those with
low process conformance (88.2 versus 86.6). This dif-
ference of 1.6 points is statistically signiﬁcant at the
1% level.15 As a result, our setting does not appear to
be characterized by a trade-off between customer ser-
vice and process conformance. Furthermore, we have
no reason to believe that, at stores with low process
conformance, employees who leave are more customer
service and sales oriented than are those employees
who stay. Although we are unable to observe individual
employees’ inclinations toward process conformance or
customer service, we expect some degree of similarity
across employees within a store, especially given that
hiring at a store is generally done by a single manager.
Finally, it is not obvious that our ﬁndings translate to
a more exploration-oriented setting in which there may
exist a trade-off between process conformance and per-
formance measures, such as customer service. In such
settings, a push toward greater process conformance and
standardization will likely limit process ﬂexibility; the
theoretical effects of this trade-off on overall store or
ﬁrm performance are not clear. As such, our ﬁndings
are most applicable to exploitation-oriented settings (i.e.,
those settings in which the returns to having consistent
and replicable processes are greater than those to having
a high level of ﬂexibility).

Despite these caveats, our study has important man-
agerial
implications. To reduce the costs associated
with employee turnover, most recommend that managers
focus on reducing the level of turnover. Here we sug-
gest that, in certain settings, managers may also be able
to reduce the turnover’s effect (regardless of its absolute
level) by focusing on process management and the cre-
ation of standard operating procedures. Our ﬁndings sug-
gest that the current managerial and ﬁnancial resources
dedicated to reducing the occurrence of turnover might
be redirected, at least in part, to improving the ﬁrm’s
ability to manage turnover’s impact.

Endnotes
1For example, see Sasha Corporation (2007) for a list of stud-
ies that estimate the cost of turnover.
2Examples of questions relating to the customer service envi-
ronment:

• Was area outside the door and around the display win-

dows clean and neat?

• Were facilities in the restroom in working order?
• Were bookshelves fully stocked, without gaps or the back

of shelves showing?
Examples of questions relating to customer service interac-
tions:

• Did any employee initiate verbal acknowledgment or

greet you while you were in the store?

• Was at least one employee visible and approachable at

the information desk?

• Did employees make additional item suggestions?

3We note that the distinction between permanent and tem-
porary employees is not the same as that between full-time
and part-time employees. Permanent employees are those who
are employed for an unspeciﬁed duration; they are considered
either full time or part time based on the number of hours they
work each week. Temporary employees are hired for a speci-
ﬁed period of time (e.g., one month). During that period, they
may work in either a full- or part-time basis.
4We had access to monthly RPL scores. We were not able,
however, to obtain quarterly store conditions scores. We were
able to collect data only on average store conditions scores for
each year.
5We also repeated our analysis using store manager turnover
during the past three months. Although the magnitude of the
store manager turnover coefﬁcient as well as its signiﬁcance
changed slightly in different models, the direction remained
the same. We do not report the results using this alternative
measure of store manager turnover.
6Managers at Borders consider Barnes & Noble and other Bor-
ders stores in the area as the main competitors to a speciﬁc
Borders store. Consequently, Borders tracks the opening and
closing of Barnes & Noble and other Borders stores near each
existing Borders store.
7Unemployment data were obtained from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
8In this setting, these unobserved, time-invariant aspects of a
store include factors such as physical size and layout.
9Variation in RPL scores was calculated using monthly RPL
scores for each store.
10The standard deviation of three-month turnover using pooled
observations from all cross sections and time periods is 0.109
for full-time employee turnover, 0.242 for part-time turnover,
and 0.101 for total turnover. The standard deviation of three-
month turnover within a store varies from 0.024 to 0.245 for
full-time turnover, from 0.067 to 0.801 for part-time turnover,
and from 0.033 to 0.27 for total employee turnover. In inter-
preting our results, we use the standard deviation of turnover
within an average store.
11In 1999, Borders Group’s net income was $90.3 million.
Approximately 60% of the company’s sales came from Bor-
ders stores. If we assume a similar share of the proﬁts, Bor-
ders stores contributed to about $54 million in proﬁt. We note
that the 2.72% decrease in a store’s proﬁt margin leads to a
larger decrease in corporate net income as the former does not
include part of the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
expenses (it
includes store labor, which is reported under
SG&A), it also does not include other investment expenses or
taxes.
12Note that the number of observations dropped signiﬁcantly,
as we were able to obtain only three years of data for store
conditions.

13The turnover rate is the number of total separations as a
percent of total employment in these industries.
14According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005b), retail
salespeople, cashiers, food preparation and serving workers
(including waiters and waitresses), and cooks in fast-food
chains accounted for 13.9 million employees, or about 10.6%
of total employment in 2005.
15We do not observe a difference in average proﬁt margins
between high-conformance and low-conformance stores.
