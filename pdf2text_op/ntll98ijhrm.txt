Abstract Drawing  from  a  cultural  values  perspective,  we  investigate  the  effects  of
country origins on HR (human resource) practices of  rms from the United States, Great
Britain,  Japan  and  Hong  Kong  operating  in  Hong  Kong.  In  general,  results  supported
hypothesized  differences in  HR  practices of  rms from  different countries. In  addition,
results indicated that HR  practices, speci cally structural training and  development  and
retention-oriented compensation, were related to various measures of  rm performance.
Of  further  interest  was  the   nding  that  country  origin  moderated  relationships  of  HR
practices  with   rm  performance;  in  general,  relationships  of  structural  training  and
development  and  retention-oriented  compensation  were  stronger  for  Hong  Kong   rms.
Implications of  the  results are discussed.

Introduction

During  the  last  decade, increasing  attention  has been  paid  to  the  area of  international
human  resource  management  (IHRM),  which  is  concerned  with  human  resource
management  issues  of  multinational  enterprises  (Schuler  et  al.,  1993;  Taylor  et  al.,
1996).  Interest  in  IHRM  has  been  enhanced  by  recent   ndings  that  human  resource
policies and practices can be a source of sustained competitive advantage to  rms (Lado
and  Wilson,  1994;  Pfeffer,  1994).  As  scholars  in  international  human  resource
management  have  noted,  however,  transferring  HR  policies  and  practices  to  different
countries  can  be  problematic  (Huo  and  Von  Glinow,  1995;  Rosenzweig  and  Nohria,
1994).  For  example, multinational  corporations  (MNCs) are faced with  issues such  as
how  to  align  HR  policies  and  practices  with  the  rest  of  the  corporation  (i.e.  global
integration)  and  how  to  adapt  HRM  practices  to  the  local  environment  in  which  the
subsidiary  is  operating  (i.e.  local  adaptation).  Among  other  factors,  scholars  have
suggested  that  the  national  origin  of  the  MNC  is  a  major  in uence  on  the  trade-off
between  global  integration  and  local  adaptation  and  thus  necessitates  careful  study
(Caligiuri  and  Stroh,  1995;  Schuler et al.,  1993;  Taylor  and  Beechler, 1993).  Because
of  differences  in  cultural  values,  MNCs  of  different  country  origins  tend  to  have
different  degrees  of  adaptation  to  local  conditions.  In  this  study,  we  investigate
in uences  of  country  origins  on   rms’  HRM  practices.  Additionally,  we  extend
research by  investigating  whether  HRM practices are related to   rm performance and
by investigating whether country origin of the  rm moderates the relationships between
HRM practices  and   rm  performance.

HR  practices  and   rm performance  of  MNCs

633

Scholars  have  proposed  that  two  major  in uences  on  human  resource management
practices  of  multinational   rms  are  local  contextual  factors  (such  as  labour  market
conditions,  unionization,  legal  and  socio-political  environments)  and  the   rm’s home-
country  culture (Brewster, 1995;  Jackson and Schuler, 1995;  Yang, 1992).  Firms have
to  obey  local  regulations,  and  local  environmental  conditions  may  in uence  the  HR
practices of MNCs operating  in the host country  (Schuler  et al., 1993).  Another  major
in uence on HR practices of MNCs is the culture of the home-country (i.e. the country
of origin) (Ferner, 1996).  Scholars have suggested that  rms from some countries, with
certain cultural  values,  are better  able to adapt  to local conditions  than  are  rms from
other countries that are more likely to transfer the practices used in their home country
(Schuler  et  al.,  1993;  Taylor  and  Beechler,  1993).  In  addition,  culture  of  the  home
country  is expected to in uence  rms’ HR practices, because some practices are more
acceptable to  employees  with  certain  cultural  values  (e.g.  individual  pay-for-perform-
ance  plans  in  individualistic  countries)  (Hofstede,  1980;  Newman  and  Nollen,  1996;
Von  Glinow,  1993).  In  this  study,  we  investigate  whether  country  origin  of  the   rm
in uences human resource practices and control for local contextual effects by sampling
 rms  operating  in  the  same setting.

Recent evidence suggests that a  rm’s HRM practices are related to its performance
(Arthur,  1994;  Huselid,  1995;  Koch  and  McGrath,  1996).  Little  research  has
investigated  relationships  between  HRM  practices  and   rm  performance  for  multi-
national  corporations,  however. None  the less, some evidence suggests  that there may
be a set of ‘best practices’ of HRM that leads to better  rm performance; such practices
would,  presumably,  be  appropriate  for  MNCs  operating  in  various  settings  (Hiltrop,
1996; Huselid, 1995; Von Glinow, 1993). We investigate the ‘best practices’ hypothesis
by  examining  relationships  between  HRM  practices  and   rm  performance.  Other
evidence suggests, however, that the effectiveness of HRM practices depends upon the
 rm’s strategic and environmental contingencies (Huselid, 1995). Therefore, we extend
previous research by investigating  whether country origin of the  rm, which is thought
to  in uence  strategic  and  environmental  contingencies,  moderates  the  relationships
between  HRM practices and   rm  performance.

Theoretical  background

In uences of  country  origin  on  human  resource  practices  of  MNCs

We  adopt  a  cultural  values  theoretical  framework  to  examine  the  effects  of  country
origin on HR practices. Countries differ in their cultural values (Hofstede, 1980,  1991),
which, in turn, are expected to in uence both willingness to adapt to local conditions as
well as the type of HR practices used by  rms. More speci cally, we propose that  rms
from countries with certain cultural values are more willing  and perhaps better able to
adapt  their  HR practices to  local  conditions,  than  are   rms  from  countries  with  other
values.  This adaptation  argument is consistent with Hannon  et al.’s (1995)  discussion.
Similarly, we expect that cultural values associated with certain countries in uence HR
practices  directly  and  thus  some  HR  practices  are  more  likely  to  be  used  by   rms in
their  overseas’  subsidiaries.  These  HR  practices  could  in  fact  be  more  acceptable  to
certain  people  in  some  countries.  An  effective  HR  system  could  then  be  achieved  if
there is  a  congruence  between  HRM policies  and  cultural  values  in  the  host  country.
A  central  theoretical  concern  underlying  the   eld  of  IHRM  is  the  tension  between
global integration and local adaptation (Hannon et al., 1995; Porter, 1986; Prahalad and


634 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al.

Doz, 1987;  Rosenzweig  and  Singh,  1991).  On  the  one  hand,  MNCs desire some level
of consistency in their HRM practices across countries (i.e. global integration).  On the
other hand,  MNCs have  to adapt  their  HRM  practices to norms and regulations  in  the
host  country  (i.e.  local  adaptation)  (Adler,  1986;  Dowling,  1989).  In  the  face  of  this
basic  dilemma,  MNCs  have  adopted  one  of  three  general  strategies  for  managing  the
work-force  in  the  host  country:  the  ethnocentric,  polycentric  or  geocentric  strategy
(Caligiuri  and  Stroh,  1995;  Dowling,  1989).  MNCs  using  the  ethnocentric  strategy
transfer  the  headquarters’  HR  practices  to  their  overseas  subsidiaries  in  order  to
maximize  the  headquarters’  control  and  integrate  subsidiaries;  this  results  in  little,  or
no,  local  responsiveness.  At the  opposite  extreme is the  polycentric  strategy  in  which
MNCs adapt totally to local situations such that HRM practices are virtually identical to
those used by local  rms. A third  general strategy, the geocentric strategy, attempts to
balance  both  global  integration  and  local  adaptation  by  having  some  HRM  practices
dictated by corporate headquarters yet allowing other practices to be in uenced by local
pressures.

Country  origin of the MNC is thought  to in uence which strategy is used to balance
the tension between global integration and local responsiveness. This is because MNCs
from  some  countries,  with  certain cultural  values,  may  be  more willing  to  reduce the
amount  of  control  from  headquarters  and  allow  the  subsidiaries  to  adapt  to  local
contexts  than  are  MNCs  from  other  countries  (Schuler  et  al.,  1993;  Taylor  and
Beechler,  1993).  For  example,  we  expect  that   rms  from  countries  with  high
uncertainty  avoidance  (Hofstede,  1980)  are  more likely  to  transfer HR practices from
headquarters  to  local  subsidiaries  than  are   rms  from  countries  with  low  uncertainty
avoidance  because  the  direct  transfer  of  practices  reduces  uncertainty  and  risks.
Similarly, one might expect  that  rms from countries with a high  power distance  may
centralize  control  and  therefore  would  be  less  likely  to  relinquish  control  of  HR
practices to local subsidiaries (i.e. low local adaptation)  than  rms from countries with
low power distance. Interestingly, researchers have found that  rms from Japan, which
are  low  on  uncertainty  avoidance  and  high  on  power  distance  (Hofstede,  1980),  are
more  likely  to  transfer  home-country  HR  practices  to  host  countries  and  pay  little
attention  to  local  conditions  (Hiramoto,  1995;  Kopp,  1994;  Rosenzweig  and  Nohria,
1994;  Yoshino,  1976).

An  additional  factor  thought  to  in uence  the  extent  to  which   rms  will  give  up
control  from  headquarters  and  allow  subsidiaries  to  adapt  to  contextual  factors  is  the
similarity in culture between the country  origin  of the  MNC  and  the host  country;  the
more  similar  the  cultures  the  more  locally  responsive  the  MNC  (Rosenzweig  and
Nohria,  1994;  Taylor  et  al.,  1996),  presumably  because  the   rm  does  not  have  to
change  its  practices  very  much.  For  example,  some  recent  evidence  suggested  that
Japanese  rms operating  in  Asian contexts  tend to  adapt  to local conditions  (Amante,
1995; Rodgers and Wong, 1996; Wong 1996). Such results are explained by noting that
although, in general, Japanese  rms tend to be relatively unwilling to allow subsidiaries
to adapt to local conditions, because of the cultural similarity between Japan and Asian
countries,   rms  are  allowed  a  greater  amount  of  local  adaptation  in  Asian  contexts.

Country  of  origin  and  HRM

In  this  study,  we  investigate  whether  country  origins  of  the  MNC’s  headquarters
in uences  the  HR  practices  of  subsidiaries  in  a  host  country  and  control  for  the  host
country’s  contextual  factors  by  examining  MNCs  operating  in  a  single  country.  By

635

examining  MNCs  operating  in  a  single  country,  this  research  design  controls  for
contextual  factors,  such  as  work-force  characteristics,  labour-market  conditions,  the
legal and socio-political  environments, etc., that vary across countries and are likely to
in uence the degree to which the MNC is able to transfer the HRM system of its parent
company  overseas  (Rosenzweig  and  Nohria,  1994;  Taylor  et  al.,  1996).  Therefore,
variability in HR practices associated with country origins are attributed  to the cultural
in uences from the headquarters to the overseas subsidiaries and/or to the similarity in
cultures of the home country and the host country.  This research design has been used
by  scholars  interested  in  the  similarities  and  differences in  HR practices  of  MNCs  of
different  country  origins  operating  in  the  single  country  setting  (e.g.  Monks,  1996;
Rosenzweig  and  Nohria,  1994;  Yuen  and  Hui,  1993).

We chose Hong Kong as the single-country  setting for our study and examined local
Chinese,  Japanese, British  and American  rms. Hong  Kong  is an  ideal  setting  for  our
research because it is one of the world’s largest trading and  nancial centres and a place
where  Asian  and  Western  culture  exist  side  by  side.  Additionally,  Hong  Kong  has
numerous  MNCs,  in  addition  to  local  Chinese   rms,  and  these  MNCs,  which  come
from  different  regions  of  the  world,  have  huge  investments  in  the  local  economy.
Furthermore,  the  Hong  Kong  government’s  laissez-faire doctrine  and  the  resultant
economic policies have fostered an environment where the ‘natural cultural tendencies’
of MNCs can operate freely (Shaw, Kirkbride et al., 1993). Evidence suggests that local
Chinese  rms differ from MNCs from other countries in terms of their corporate culture
(Lau  and  Ngo,  1996),  organizational  structure  (Ngo,  1996),  organization  development
practices (Lau  and  Ngo,  1997)  and  employment  relations  (England,  1989).  Therefore,
we expect local Chinese  rms will also differ from MNCs from other countries in terms
of  HR  practices.

Only one study  was found  that had  compared HRM practices of  rms from various
countries  that  were  operating  in  Hong  Kong  (Shaw,  Tang  et  al.,  1993).  These
researchers  suggested  that  national  culture  should  predict  HR  practices  and  grouped
 rms  into  three  broad  categories  to  measure the  effects of  culture:  (1)  Western   rms
included  MNCs  from  the  United  States,  Australia,  Britain  and  Canada;  (2)  the  local
Chinese category included  rms from Hong Kong and Singapore; (3) the third category
included   rms  from  Japan,  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  and  all  other  countries.
Although  such a rough  classi cation is likely to dilute the ‘cultural effect’, since there
is  still  considerable  variability  in  cultural  characteristics  within  each  group,  some
differences  in  human  resource  practices  between  Anglo-American  and  Chinese   rms
were reported  (Shaw,  Tang  et  al.,  1993).  As  they  expected,  Western  MNCs  in  Hong
Kong  were more formalized and  systematic in  their HRM practices, were more likely
to  use formal performance appraisal and  feedback systems, to  have  extensive  welfare
and fringe bene t programmes, and to provide more formal training to employees than
were the  Chinese   rms.  Although  the  Shaw,  Tang  et  al.  (1993)  study  provides  some
initial  evidence  concerning  how  national  culture  may  in uence  HR  practices,  their
study is somewhat limited by their collapsing across countries and by their measures of
HR  practices.  We  extend  their  work  by  addressing  such  limitations,  by  conducting
multivariate analyses and by linking HR practices to  rm performance and investigating
whether  country  origin  moderates  relationships  between  HR  practices  and   rm
performance.

In  summary,  theoretical  and  empirical  evidence  suggest  that  the  HR  practices  of
MNCs  will  vary  by  their  nationality  because  cultural  values  of  the  home  country
in uence the extent to which top management allows local subsidiaries a high degree of


636 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al.

local  adaptation  and  because  certain  HR  practices  are  more  likely  in  countries  with
certain cultural  values.  Therefore,  we  propose  this  general  hypothesis:

Hypothesis  1: Country  origin  of  MNCs will in uence the  human resource practices
used  by   rms.

In  addition  to  this  general  hypothesis,  we  propose  some  speci c  directional
hypotheses concerning how country origin in uences HR practices. For example, local
Chinese  rms tend  to  be centralized, paternalistic  and nepotistic,  with  little systematic
planning  or structuring (Ngo, 1996;  Redding  and Wong,  1986).  Because local Chinese
 rms tend to have little systematic planning  in HR activities (Lau and Ngo, 1997),  we
expect  that  they  will  have  less  training  and  development  than   rms  from  other
countries.  This is because Chinese tend  to  have less concern for  long-term strategy of
developing  human resources, and therefore do not have much interest in human capital
investment.  Additionally,  we  expect  that  the  cultural  value  of  individualism  versus
collectivism (Hofstede, 1980) will in uence  rms’ compensation plans. Speci cally, we
expect  that   rms  from  countries  higher  on  individualism  are  more  likely  to  use
retention-oriented  compensation  plans  than   rms  from  countries  that  are  more
collectivistic;  in  contrast,   rms  from  countries  higher  on  collectivism  are  expected  to
use  seniority-based  compensation  plans.  Therefore,  we  expect  American  and  British
 rms, which emphasize individualistic values, are more likely to base compensation on
individual  performance so  as to  retain staff and  to  avoid  high  turnover,  whereas local
Chinese   rms  and  Japanese   rms  are  more  likely  to  base  compensation  on  seniority,
because their cultures are more collectivistic (Hofstede, 1980).  Finally,  we expect  that
local  Chinese   rms  with  their  focus  on  family,  along  with  the  Chinese  in-group
mentality  (Ngo,  1996;  Redding,  1986),  will  be  less  likely  to  use  expatriates  and  will
therefore have a work-force which is less diverse than American, Japanese, and British
 rms.  Such  arguments  lead  to  the  following  directional  hypotheses:

Hypothesis  1a: Local  Chinese   rms  will  provide  less  structural  training  and
development  than  American,  British,  and  Japanese  rms

Hypothesis  1b: American  and  British  MNCs  will  rely  more  on  retention-oriented
compensation  than  will  local  Chinese  or  Japanese   rms.

Hypothesis  1c: Japanese  and  local  Chinese  MNCs  will  emphasize  seniority-based
compensation  more than  will  American and  British   rms.

Hypothesis  1d: Local   rms  will  have  less  diversity  in  staff  composition  than
Japanese, American,  or  British   rms.

Finally,  although  not  a  speci c  hypothesis,  we  expect  that  Japanese  and  Chinese
 rms  will  be  relatively  similar  to  each  other  in  terms  of  HR  practices  because  of
similarities  in  their  national  cultures  (e.g.  in uence  of  Confucianism).  Similarly,  we
expect that American and British  rms will be more similar to each other than they will
be  to  Chinese  and  Japanese   rms.

Human  resource  practices  and   rm performance

Recently,  scholars  have  argued  that  the  management  of  human  resources  can provide
 rms with a sustained competitive advantage to the extent that the human resources add

value, are rare, are not easily imitable and cannot be easily replaced with technological
advances (Huselid, 1995;  Pfeffer, 1994;  Wright  and McMahan, 1992).  Some evidence
supports the proposed relationships between human resource policies and practices and
indicators of  rm performance (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995; Koch and McGrath, 1996;
MacDuf e,  1995;  Russell  et  al.,  1985;  Terpstra  and  Rozell,  1993).  Researchers
investigating  relationships between HR practices and  rm performance, however, have
operationalized  HR practices in several different ways. For example, some researchers
have  examined  only  one  HR  practice  (e.g.  staf ng  practices:  Terpstra  and  Rozell,
1993),  other  researchers  have  viewed  HR  practices  as  control  systems  and  have
therefore focused on compensation, incentive and reward systems (Koch and McGrath,
1996;  Snell,  1992).  Wright  and  McMahan  (1992)  argued,  however,  that  researchers
should  examine  ‘bundles’  of  HR  practices  and  their  collective  effect,  rather  than  the
effect  of  isolated  HR  practices,  on   rm  performance.  As  Peck  (1994)  noted,  human
resource  activities  are  interdependent,  and  as a  whole  they  generate  certain  outcomes
for the  rm. Recent studies by Huselid (1995) and MacDuf e (1995)  provided  support
for such arguments as they found that bundles of HR practices were signi cantly related
to  workers’ productivity  and   rm   nancial  performance.

Little  research  has  investigated  effects  of  HR  practices  on   rm  performance  for
MNCs. As Schuler  et al. (1993) noted,  however, MNCs must design the HR system to
balance  the  dual  imperatives  of  local  responsiveness  and  global  integration  and  this
balance  will  have  performance implications.  For  example,  Caligiuri  and  Stroh  (1995)
presented evidence suggesting that MNCs that adopted ethnocentric strategies were less
successful  than  companies  employing  other  strategies.  There  is,  however,  little
systematic research on the impact of HR practices on performance of MNCs operating
in  a  host  country.  None  the  less,  drawing  on  previous  research  suggesting  that  HR
practices  are  related to   rm  performance,  we advance  this  general  hypothesis:

Hypothesis  2: The  human  resource  practices  of  MNCs  will  be  related  to   rm
performance.

Based  on  current  literature,  we  also  propose  some  speci c  directional  hypotheses
concerning  relationships  between  HR  practices  and   rm  performance.  As  Koch  and
McGrath  (1996)  noted,  there  are  several  reasons  to  expect  structural  training  and
development  to  be positively  related to   rm performance. Speci cally, systematic and
well-planned  training  and  development  typically  increases  the   rm  speci city  of
employee  skills, which  not  only  provides  the   rm with  productive  employees, but  can
also reduce employee turnover  because employees with  rm-speci c skills may not be
able  to  transfer  their  skills  directly  to  other   rms  and  be  equally  productive.
Furthermore, more extensive training  and development can reduce expenses associated
with  hiring  people  from  external  labour  markets  by  developing  internal  human
resources  and  by  reducing  turnover  (Koch  and  McGrath,  1996).  Some  evidence
supports  the  proposition  that  training  and  development  is  related  to  indicators  of
organizational  performance  (Russell  et  al.,  1985).  Therefore,  we  propose  this
hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2a: The extent  of  structural training  and development  will be  positively
related  to   rm  performance.

Firms’  compensation  plans  are  also  thought  to  in uence   rm  performance  through
in uencing employee behaviours.  Speci cally,  rms can use compensation to motivate


638 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al.

employees  to  increase  their  efforts  and  to  direct  their  efforts  towards  important   rm
outcomes  (Gomez-Mejia  and  Balkin,  1992;  Heneman,  1992).  Propositions  from
expectancy  theory  (Vroom,  1964)  suggest  that  pay  can  in uence  performance  when
employees perceive a relationship between their efforts and performance and when they
then  obtain  a  valued  outcome  if  they  perform  well  (Heneman,  1992).  Thus,
compensation  plans  targeted  at  retaining  productive  staff  by  emphasizing  individual-
based,  outcome-oriented  HR  practices  are  likely  to  result  in  better   rm  performance.
Drawing  on  such  logic  we  propose  the  following  hypothesis:

Hypothesis  2b: Firms  with  more  retention-oriented  compensation  plans  will  have
better performance.

Finally,  more  diversity  in  a  work-force  is  thought  to  in uence   rm  performance
through  various  mechanisms (Cox  and  Blake,  1991;  Glick  et al., 1993).  For  example,
greater  diversity  in  workers  leads  to  additional  perspectives  and  improved  creativity.
Furthermore,  increased  staff  diversity  is  thought  to  lead  to  greater   exibility  and
improved  decision  quality  because  of  the  additional  perspectives  applied  to  the
problem.  Therefore,  drawing  on  this  logic  we  propose  this  directional  hypothesis:

Hypothesis  2c: MNCs  that  emphasize  diversity  will  have  higher  performance,
particularly  in  new  product  development.

Interaction  effect of  country  origin  and  HR  practices  on   rm  performance

As discussed above,  the ‘best  practices’ model  of HRM suggests that  more successful
 rms tend  to use a similar set of HR policies and practices, such  as structural training
and  development  and  retention-oriented  compensation  (Hiltrop,  1996;  Huselid,  1995).
There is some evidence to support the proposition  that certain ‘best’ HR practices result
in  higher  performance  of  MNCs  consistently  across  different  cultures,  irrespective  of
their  national  origin  and  the  local  environmental  conditions  (MacDuf e  and  Krafcik,
1992;  Wickens, 1987;  Von Glinow, 1993).  Such evidence suggests that there may be a
universal set of ‘best’ human resource management practices that, if used by  rms, lead
to  better   rm  performance.

Conversely,  or  perhaps  additionally,  the  effectiveness  of  the  human  resource
practices  may depend  upon  contextual  factors such  as  the   rm’s  strategic orientation,
the  operating  environment,  the   rm’s  culture  and  the   rm’s  country  origin  (Huselid,
1995).  Literature  in  strategic  HRM,  for  example,  suggests  that  the  matching  of  HR
practices  with  organizational  and  environment  contexts  will  result  in  high   rm
performance  (Dyer  and  Reeves,  1995).  Organizational  effectiveness  depends  on
whether there is a ‘cultural  t’ between HR practices and the dominant value system of
the   rm  (Mendonca  and  Kanungo,  1994).  Evidence  indicates  that  country  origin
in uences   rms’  culture  and  value  systems  (Lau  and  Ngo,  1996).  Because the   rms’
value systems in uence whether a certain HR practice  ts, it seems likely that country
origin  will  in uence  the  relationships  of  HR  practices  with   rm  performance.
Furthermore,  organizational  members  may  have  certain  expectations  about  the  HR
practices  of  the   rm,  given  its  country  origin  and  its  internal  value  system;  these
expectations, in turn should in uence their work behaviours and hence the effectiveness
of  HR  practices  such  that  practices  that  meet  expectations  will  be  more  effective.
Finally,  although  certain  HR  practices  may  be  the  ‘best’  practices  in  terms  of
in uencing   rm performance,  rms from some countries,  with  certain cultural  values,


HR  practices  and   rm performance  of  MNCs

may  not  optimally  implement  these  practices  in  a  foreign  country.  For  example,
Newman  and  Nollen  (1996)  noted  that  pay-for-performance  plans  are  successful  in
Anglo  countries,  but  are  not  as  successful or  popular  in  other  parts of  the  world.

As Huselid  (1995)  noted,  it  is possible  there can be  a set of  best  HR practices that
in uence  rm performance and  rm performance also may be in uenced by the ‘ t’ of
the  HR  practices  with  the   rm’s  cultural  values.  For  example,  pay-for-performance
plans  may  be  positively  related  to   rm  performance  across  countries,  and  such
relationships  may be stronger  for countries with  individualistic  values. As statisticians
have noted, it is possible to have both a meaningful interaction effect and a meaningful
main  effect,  although  the  signi cant  interaction  quali es  interpretation  of  the  main
effects  (Kirk,  1968).  Therefore,  we  propose  that  certain  HR  practices  are  positively
related  to   rm  performance  (hypothesis  2)  and  we  also  propose  that  country  origin
moderates  the  relationships  of  HR  practices  with   rm  performance.

Hypothesis  3: Country  origin  will  moderate  the  relationships  of  human  resource
practices  with   rm  performance.

To summarize, we extend research by examining HR practices of  rms operating  in
a single setting, namely Hong Kong. More speci cally, we investigate whether country
origin in uences  rms’ HR practices. Additionally,  we investigate relationships  of HR
practices with  rm performance, hypothesizing  that certain HR practices will be related
to  rm performance, and that country origin will moderate the relationship between HR
practices  and   rm performance.

Method

Procedure  and  sample

A survey was mailed to the human resource directors of 1700  rms that had over  fty
employees  in  Hong  Kong.  A three-wave mail design  was employed  with the   rst and
third mailing containing the invitation letter, the questionnaire and a postage-paid return
envelope.  The  second mailing was a reminder letter. We received 332  responses  for a
20 per cent response rate. Although  we would have desired a higher response rate, the
response rate for surveys in Hong Kong is typically lower than in the West and a 20 per
cent  response  rate  is  typical  (Ngo,  1996;  Redding  and  Pugh,  1986).  However,  recent
studies using similar research design with a US sample had a similar response rate (see
Delery and Doty, 1996). Respondents indicated the country origins of their  rms. Of the
responding   rms,  99   rms  are  local  Chinese   rms,  82  are  American   rms,  38  are
Japanese  rms, 34 are British  rms and the remaining are primarily other European and
Asian   rms  and  joint  ventures.  For  this  study,  we  used  only  the  local  Chinese,
American,  Japanese  and  British   rms  (n5 253).  Many  of  the   rms  were  involved  in
manufacturing  (31  per  cent),  with  other   rms  in  trading  (14  per  cent),   nance  and
banking  (12  per cent),  and  other  types  of  businesses.

Measures

HR practices One section of the survey included a list of twenty- ve human resource
management  practices.  Some  of  the  items  were  taken  from  Peck’s  (1994)  study.
Respondents were asked to describe how closely these items match their organizations’
current policies and practices on a 5-point  Likert scale, ranging from strongly  disagree


640 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al.

(1)  to  strongly  agree (5). Following  Peck’s (1994)  analytical strategy, we conducted  a
principal  component  factor  analysis  with  varimax  rotation.  Our  purposes  were  to
identify  possible  underlying  dimensions  of  these  twenty- ve  HRM  practices  and  to
summarize them with a small number of ‘derived’ variables. Examination  of the scree
test suggested  four  factors that  accounted  for  37 per cent of the  variance of the  items.
We assigned items to scales only when the item had a factor loading of greater than .4
for a single factor (see Table 1). We also conducted  split-halves  factor analyses of the
sample, and adopted different rotation techniques in order to ensure the stability of the
factor  structure.  No  signi cant  deviation  from  the  current  results  was  detected,
however.

(seven  items,  alpha5

The  rst factor, which included items measuring the  rm’s training and development
practices  and  formalization  of  human  resource  procedures  was  labelled  structural
.72).  These  items  are  sometimes
training  and  development
considered characteristics of an internal labour market orientation (Peck, 1994) and the
 rm’s  willingness  to  invest  in  human  capital.  The  second  factor,  labelled  retention-
oriented compensation, included items measuring the  rm’s compensation practices and
items  measuring  the   rm’s  philosophy  and  practices  to  reduce  turnover  (increase
.64).  The  third  factor,  labelled seniority-
retention)  of  employees  (seven  items, alpha5
based compensation, included two items (alpha5
.49) indicating that compensation was
tied to seniority and the job title. This scale re ects the  rm’s emphasis on hierarchical
status.  The  fourth  factor,  diversity,  included  two  items  (alpha5
.46)  measuring  the
extent to which the staff was composed of expatriates and how diverse it was in terms
of  demographic  characteristics.  This  factor  is  a  generic  measure  of  the   rm’s
heterogeneity  of  its  human  resources.

Firm performance Respondents were asked to indicate their  rm’s performance over
the  last  three  years  as  compared  to  the  industry’s  average  in  these  areas:  sales,  net
pro t, development of new products/services, satisfaction of employees and retention of
essential  employees.  A  5-point  scale  ranging  from  bad  (1)  to  very  good  (5)  was
used.

Analyses  and  results

Table 2 shows  the  means, standard deviations  and correlation matrix for  all variables.
In  general,  the  indicators  of   rm  performance  were  moderately  correlated  with  each
other  (rs  range  from  .32  to  .78).  Interestingly,  the  HR  practices  were only  somewhat
related  to  each  other.  Speci cally,   rms  that  provided  more  structural  training  and
development tended to use retention-oriented  compensation  (r5
.01). Similarly,
diversity  was related  to  retention-oriented  compensation  (r5
.05).  None  of  the
other  correlations  among  the  HR  practices were signi cant.

To test hypothesis  1, which hypothesized  that the country origin of a  rm in uences
its  human  resources  practices,  we  conducted  a  multivariate  analysis  of  variance,
followed  by  univariate  analyses of  variance  and  a multiple  comparison  post  hoc LSD
test  to  determine  which  country  origins  were  signi cantly  different  from  the  others.

Examination  of  Table 3  indicates,  as proposed  in  hypothesis  1a,  that  local  Chinese
 rms  provided  the  least  amount  of  structural  training  and  development,  but,  un-
expectedly,  they were not  different from Japanese  rms. Results indicate that the local
Chinese and Japanese  rms provided  similar amounts of training and development and
provided signi cantly less than US or British  rms, who did not differ from each other.
Turning  to  retention-oriented  compensation,  results  provided  partial  support  for
hypothesis  1b  in  that  the  US  and  British   rms  provided  more  retention-oriented
compensation than the local Chinese or Japanese  rms, although the difference between
the  British  rms and  the local  Chinese   rms was not  signi cant. Turning  to  seniority-
based  compensation,  the Japanese  rms were highest  in  seniority-based  compensation
and were signi cantly different from all other  rms in partial support of hypothesis  1c.
Finally,  in  support  of  hypothesis  1d,  the  local  Chinese   rms  were the  least diverse  in
staff  composition  and  were  signi cantly  different  from  all  other   rms.  Somewhat
surprisingly,  Japanese  rms were the most diverse and were signi cantly more diverse
than  rms originating from the US. This result can be explained by the extensive hiring
of Japanese expatriates as managers in the local Japanese  rms (Wong, 1996). Taken in
sum,  these  results  provide  strong  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  country  origin
in uences  rms’ human resource management practices and, in general, the pattern of
results tended  to  support  our  a  priori  directional  hypotheses,  with  a  few exceptions.

To test the effects of HR practices on  rms’ performance and their interaction effects
with  country  origin,  as  proposed  in  hypotheses  2  and  3,  hierarchical  moderated
regression analysis was performed. To control for effects of  rm size and country origin
on  the  indicators  of   rm  performance,   rm  size,  measured  as  the  total  number  of
employees,  was  entered  in  step  1  and  country  origin,  entered  as  three  dummy  coded

variables with local Chinese  rms as the contrast, was entered in step 2. The third step
of  the  hierarchical  regression  analyses  entered  the  four  measures  of  HR  practices.
Support  for  hypothesis  2,  which  hypothesizes  that  HR  practices  are  related  to   rm
performance,  would  be  indicated  by  a  signi cant  increase  in  R2 when  the  set  of  HR
practices are entered in the equation.  Finally,  in step 4, the cross products  of each HR
practice and each dummy coded variable for country origin (twelve interaction terms in
total) were entered as a set. Support  for hypothesis  3, which hypothesizes that country
origin of the  rm moderates the effects of HR practices on  rm performance, would be
indicated  by  a signi cant increase in  R2 when the  set of cross-products  are entered in
the  regression  equation.

As indicated in Table 4, the set of HR practices explained signi cant variance in all
of  the  indicators  of   rm  performance  except  for  sales.  Examination  of  the  regression
coef cients indicates that  rms that provided  more structural training and development
created  more  new  products,  had  more  satis ed  employees  and  had  higher  sales.  In
addition,   rms higher  in retention-oriented  compensation  reported greater pro t, more
new  products  (statistically  signi cant  at  the  .1  alpha  level),  more  satis ed  employees
and greater retention of employees. Neither diversity nor seniority-based compensation
was signi cantly  related to  any  of  the  performance  measures. None  the  less, taken  in
sum,  such  results  indicate  that  HR  practices  are  related  to   rm  performance,  with
structural  training  and development  and greater usage of retention-oriented  compensa-
tion  as particularly  important.

The regression results also provide  partial support for hypothesis  3, which proposed
that  country  origin  moderates the  effects of  HR  practices  on   rm  performance. More
speci cally,  the  set  of  interaction  terms  explained  additional  variance  in  employee
satisfaction and employee retention, providing partial support for hypothesis 3. Because
local  Chinese   rms  were  the  contrast  group  used  in  the  dummy  coding  for  country
origin,  examination  of  the  signi cant  interaction  regression  coef cients  provides
information  about  relationships  of  variables in  comparison  to  the  local  Chinese   rms.
For  example,  the  signi cant  regression  coef cients  indicate  that  the  relationship

Finally, the use of retention-oriented  compensation  was negatively related to employee

To  investigate  further  how  country  origin  moderates  the  relationship  between  HR

correlations  for  the  signi cant  interaction  effects,  namely  training  with  satisfaction,
training  with  retention  and  retention-oriented  compensation  with  retention,  and  tested
for signi cant differences among the correlations. Results indicated that the relationship
of  structural  training  and  development  with  employee  satisfaction  was  signi cantly
stronger  for  local  Chinese   rms  (r5

Discussion

We adopted a cultural values perspective to investigate the effects of country origin on
 rms’ human resource practices for MNCs. We extended  recent works in international
human resource management by investigating relationships between country origin, HR
practices  and   rm  performance  of  MNCs  in  Hong  Kong.  Our  results  indicate  that
MNCs  of  different  country  origins  differ  considerably  in  their  HRM  practices,
particularly in training and development and compensation. Furthermore, we found that
HR practices are  related  to  various  measures of   rm  performance.  Of  further  interest
was the   nding  that  country  origin  moderated  the  relationships  between HR practices
and   rm  performance.

We  proposed  that  country  origin  would  in uence  HR  practices,  in  part,  because
certain HR practices would be acceptable in some countries with certain cultural values.
It is also likely  that some of the HR practices used in headquarters  will  be  transferred
to foreign  subsidiaries. The proposition  that cultural values would  in uence  rms’ HR
practices also  led  us  to  make speci c  directional  hypotheses  concerning  HR  practices
used  by   rms  originating  from  certain  countries.  Although,  in  general,  the  results
supported  our  hypotheses,  further  research  is  necessary  to  investigate  the  speci c
effects of  cultural  values  on  HR practices.  For  example,  researchers might  attempt to
measure HR practices of  rms from various countries and relate such practices to some
speci c  cultural  values,  perhaps  using  Hofstede’s  (1980)  values  framework.  Admit-
tedly,  it  would  be  dif cult  to  obtain  data  regarding  HR  practices  from  various   rms
located  in  numerous  countries.  None  the  less,  such  an  effort  could  provide  further
insight  into how cultural values in uence HR practices, albeit that different contextual
variables (such  as socio-legal  factors, labour  market conditions,  work-force  character-
istics)  have  to  be  controlled.

We  also  proposed  that  country  origin  would  in uence  HR  practices  of  MNCs
because  cultural  values  of  countries  would  in uence  the  extent  to  which   rms  from
certain countries  would  relinquish  control  from headquarters and allow subsidiaries to
devise HR practices that adapted to local conditions. Again, future research is called for

to study  to what extent cultural values of home countries in uence the degree of local
adaptation  in  overseas  af liates.  Cross-cultural  design  that  attempts  to  measure  HR
practices of MNCs from several countries that operate in various  settings is needed so
as to  investigate  whether  MNCs from some countries  are more  adaptable  than  MNCs
originating from other countries. Furthermore, researchers need to consider similarity in
cultural  values  between  the  host  and  home  countries.

Our results provided  tentative support  for the  proposition  that, because of similarity
in cultural values, local Chinese and Japanese  rms would be similar to each other and
 rms from Britain and the US would be more similar to each other and that, in general,
the  Western   rms  would  be  different  from  the  Asian   rms.  Results  indicated  no
differences  between  US  and  British   rms  in  their  HR  practices.  There  were  some
interesting  differences  between  Japanese  and  local  Chinese   rms,  however.  Speci -
cally,  local  Chinese   rms  were  less  likely  to  use  seniority-based  compensation  than
were  Japanese   rms.  Similarly,  local  Chinese   rms  were  the  lowest  on  diversity
whereas  Japanese   rms  were  highest.  Such  results  support  our  distinction  between
Asian countries and lend credence to our suggestion that researchers should not collapse
across  countries  to  create ‘cultural  groups’.

In  the  present  study,  we  also  extended  previous  research by  investigating  relation-
ships  of  HR  practices  with  various  indicators  of   rm  performance.  As  suggested  by
scholars  in  this  area (Huselid,  1995;  MacDuf e,  1995;  Wright  and  McMahan,  1992),
we  examined  several  key  aspects  of  HR  practices  simultaneously.  As  hypothesized,
retention-oriented  compensation  and  structural  training  and  development  were  pos-
itively  related  to   rm  performance,  although  we  found  no  effects for  seniority-based
compensation  and  diversity  on   rm  performance.  We  must  be  cautious  in  drawing
conclusions  about  these  latter  two  variables  because  their  low  reliability  probably
reduced  the  power  of  observing  relationships  with  the   rm  performance  measures.
None the less, our results add to the growing  literature suggesting  that management of
 rms’ human resources can provide  rms with a competitive advantage (Huselid, 1995;
Lado and Wilson, 1994;  Pfeffer, 1994). In speci c, structural training and development
and  retention-oriented  compensation  seem to  encourage  efforts and  enhance  perform-
ance  of  local  employees  working  in  the  MNCs.

Results  provided  some  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  country  origin  moderates
relationships  between  human  resource  practices  and   rm  performance.  More  speci -
cally, the set of interactions terms added signi cant explanatory  variance for employee
satisfaction and employee retention. Examination of the interaction terms suggested that
the  relationship  between  structural  training  and  development  and  satisfaction  and
retention  was  weaker  for  Japanese   rms  in  contrast  to  local  Chinese   rms.  More
speci cally,  structural  training  and  development  was  positively  related  to  satisfaction
and retention for local Chinese  rms (rs5
.57 and .28, respectively) but was negatively
related to these outcome variables for Japanese  rms (rs5
.19, respectively).
Furthermore,  the  relationship  of  structural  training  and  development  with  employee
satisfaction was stronger for local Chinese  rms than for US  rms (r5
.18). Therefore,
although  local Chinese   rms tend  to have  less structural  training  and  development,  as
indicated by examination of means (presented in Table 3), the training they provided is
more effective in  increasing employee satisfaction and  retention  than that  provided  by
Japanese and  US  rms. Interestingly,  the  relationship  of  retention-oriented  compensa-
tion  with  employee  retention  was  stronger  for  local  Chinese  and  Japanese   rms
compared  with  American   rms  (rs  of  .38,  .36.  and  2
.02,  respectively).  Retention-
oriented  compensation  plans did  not  increase retention  for  American  rms, but  did  so

for local Chinese and Japanese  rms. Although  not  a speci c hypothesis,  we expected
that   rms  from  individualistic  countries,  such  as  the  US,  would  be  more  effective  in
using  retention-oriented  compensation  than  would   rms  from  collectivistic  countries,
such as Hong Kong and Japan (Hofstede, 1980).  These results are opposite of what we
expected,  however.  One  interpretation  of  these   ndings  is  that  local  Chinese  and
Japanese  rms were better able to use retention-oriented compensation in a manner that
aligns with the values of local Chinese employees. The US  rms, in contrast, may have
used  retention-oriented  compensation  in  a more individualistic  manner,  which  did  not
match  the  values  of  the  local  employees  and  therefore  had  no  effect  on  reducing
turnover.

We want to acknowledge  certain limitations of our study.  First, the  results from the
factor analysis  of  the  HR practices  were not  intuitively  apparent.  Because there is no
theory  specifying  how  the  twenty- ve  HR  practices  should  be  grouped  together,  we
followed  recommendations  of  Guest  (1997)  and  Wood  and  Albanese  (1995)  and
conducted  an  exploratory  factor  analysis  on  the  items.  The  use  of  factor  analysis  is
based on the assumption that the HR practices are related to each other in certain ways
that can be captured by a few underlying dimensions. Our intent in using factor analysis
was  to  identify  possible  underlying  dimensions  of  the  twenty- ve  items  describing
HRM  practices  and  to  summarize  these  items  with  a  small  number  of  ‘derived’
variables.  These  derived  variables  were  used  for  subsequent  statistical  analysis  and
were conceptualized  as  representing  certain  ‘bundles’  of  HR  practices.  There  is  little
theory specifying how HR practices should be bundled together or to explain why some
items load  on one dimension  instead of  the other. Furthermore, because of our single-
sample research design,  we are not  able to  assess the  stability  of  the  four  derived  HR
measures by  using  another  independent  sample. Clearly, additional  research is needed
to  replicate our  factor structure  and  further  investigate  which  HR  practices tend  to  be
bundled  together.

As discussed above, the reliability for two of our measures of HR practices was lower
than  we  would  have  desired  and  may  have  limited  detecting  relationships  of  these
practices with   rm performance. We did   nd  that  country  origin  in uenced  these HR
practices, however,  notwithstanding  the  low  reliability.  Our  measures of  performance,
although appearing to be content valid and acceptable in organizational survey research,
were  single-item  perceptual  measures.  Therefore,  future  research  might  replicate  our
results  with  objective  measures  of   rm  performance.  Additionally,  our  response  rate
was lower than we would have desired, and, although  the sample appeared representa-
tive  of   rms  in  Hong  Kong,  clearly  there  may  be  issues  associated  with  the
generalizability of the results given the response rate. Finally, although all the measures
were  collected  from  a  single  survey,  it  seems  unlikely  that  method  variance  is  an
alternative explanation  for  the effects of country  origin  on  HR practices or the pattern
of  relationships  we  found  between HR practices  and   rm  performance.

Much of the prior scholarly research in the area of IHRM focuses on corporate-wide
and global issues. Relatively few studies address HR policies and practices of MNCs at
the host-country  level. The present study  lls this research void,  and contributes  to the
existing  literature  in  the  following  two  ways.  First  of  all,  we  investigate  the
relationships  between country  origin  of  MNCs and HR practices, and  extend  previous
studies by examining their impact on  rm performance. Second, instead of focusing on
a  single  HR  practice  such  as  expatriates’  assignment  and  reward,  we  analyse  several
major aspects of HRM (including  training and development, performance management
and  compensation,  and  diversity  of  the  work-force)  simultaneously,  and  relate  them

systematically to various indicators of  rm performance. Results indicate a moderating
effect of country origin on the relationships between HR practices and performance, and
suggest  the  importance  of  ‘cultural   t’  to  HRM.  This  is  an  area  that  deserves  to  be
explored  in  future  research.
