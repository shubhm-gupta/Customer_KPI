Work Organization, Technology, and Performance in Customer Service
and Sales

Abstract
The author analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of Total Quality Management and Self-Managed Teams, as
compared to mass production approaches to service delivery, among customer service and sales workers in a
large unionized regional Bell operating company. Participation in self-managed teams was associated with a
statistically significant improvement in self-reported service quality and a 9.3% increase in sales per employee.
When combined with new technology, teams boosted sales an additional 17.4%. These effects persisted over
time. Total Quality Management, by contrast, did not affect performance. This study represents a “strong test”
of the efficacy of teams because theory predicts weak outcomes for self-managed teams among service and
sales employees in establishments where technology and organizational structure limit opportunities for self-
regulation, the nature of work and technology do not require interdependence, and downsizing creates
pervasive job insecurity – conditions found at the company studied here.
