Compensation Management in
Outsourced Service Organizations and Its
Implications for Quit Rates, Absenteeism
and Workforce Performance: Evidence
from Canadian Call Centresbjir_816 1..26
Danielle D. van Jaarsveld and Yoshio Yanadori

Abstract

We investigate compensation management in in-house and outsourced call
centres with original establishment-level data collected in Canada. Our analysis
reveals that both customer service representatives (CSRs) and managers
employed in outsourced call centres earn 91 per cent of the cash pay earned by
their in-house counterparts. Lower cash pay levels in outsourced call centres are
related to higher CSR quit rates and absenteeism. Although CSR cash pay is
associated with improved workforce performance, the disparity in cash pay
between in-house and outsourced call centres does not result in a signiﬁcant
difference in workforce performance.

1. Introduction

Outsourcing is a common practice for many organizations as they choose
between performing work in-house or outsourcing it to external suppliers.
Empirical research on employment conditions in outsourcing organizations
is sparse. The few existing studies focus on pay differences between employ-
ees of outsourced organizations and in-house organizations (e.g. Abraham
and Taylor 1996; Berlinski 2008; Dube and Kaplan 2010). Some factors —
skill differences, industry characteristics and lower hours — have been con-
sidered as potential mechanisms inﬂuencing lower pay in outsourced ﬁrms
but do not offer a comprehensive explanation. Thus, several questions about

the outsourced pay differential remain unanswered. Moreover, little is known
about the implications of this pay disparity for the management of out-
sourced organizations. Furthering our understanding of lower pay levels and
their consequences in outsourced organizations is important because out-
sourcing is growing (Bhagwati et al. 2004). As many outsourced organiza-
tions encounter competitive pressures to reduce expenditures, employee
compensation, the single largest operational cost in most organizations
(Gerhart et al. 2009), is an especially important human resource management
(HRM) practice.

We investigate several questions about compensation management in
outsourced organizations. First, does this pay disparity for employees
transfer to managers? If it exists for managers, is it similar in magnitude
to the one for employees? Second, is there a similar disparity in beneﬁts
between in-house and outsourced organizations? Few studies of outsourc-
ing organizations examine the possible disparity in employee beneﬁts,
which represents a signiﬁcant portion of payroll expenditures (Bates
2003).1 Third, what is the relationship among outsourcing status, em-
ployee compensation and other HRM practices? Finally, what are the
implications of adopting a less generous pay policy for outsourced orga-
nizations? By addressing these questions, we present a comprehen-
sive picture of
in outsourced service
organizations.

compensation management

We analyse original establishment-level data from in-house and out-
sourced call centres located in Canada. In contrast to other outsourcing
studies that have examined individual-level data collected in the USA (e.g.
Current Population Survey; Berlinski 2008; Dube and Kaplan 2010), we
focus on the establishment level. Considering organization-level factors (e.g.
call centre characteristics, HRM practices) will provide new insights over-
looked by previous outsourcing studies. Canada is an interesting laboratory
for examining the outsourcing of customer service work because US and UK
ﬁrms often outsource customer service work to India and Canada (van
Jaarsveld et al. 2009).

We ﬁnd, consistent with Berlinski (2008) and Dube and Kaplan (2010),
signiﬁcant pay disparities for employees between in-house and outsourced
call centres. Managers employed by outsourced organizations also earn sig-
niﬁcantly less cash pay than their in-house counterparts, and this pay gap
is similar in size for both customer service representatives (CSRs) and man-
agers. In-house and outsourced call centres also differ in the HRM prac-
tices they adopt, and these choices contribute to the disparity in CSR cash
pay. Turning to the consequences of less generous compensation, lower
cash pay is associated with higher CSR quit rates and CSR absenteeism
in outsourced call centres, two factors that have been shown to increase
customer turnover (Heskett et al. 1997). In addition, CSR cash pay is sig-
niﬁcantly associated with workforce performance, but we fail to ﬁnd evi-
dence that lower pay in outsourced centres leads to lower workforce
performance.

2. Prior literature and theoretical framework

Inter-organizational Differences in Compensation

Competitive labour markets should eliminate wage gaps among employees
who perform similar jobs, yet abundant evidence shows that wage rates vary
across organizations (Gerhart and Milkovich 1990; Gerlach and Stephan
2006). Workforce characteristics, organizational size, union presence, indus-
try and geographic location account for employee pay differences (Becker
1975; Dunlop 1957; Freeman and Medoff 1984; Krueger and Summers 1988;
Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984).

Beyond these factors, management scholars argue that organizational
context, including organizational structure and corporate strategy, inﬂuences
an organizational compensation system (Gomez-Mejia and Balkin 1992;
Milkovich 1988). Decisions about an organization’s compensation system
are shaped by ﬁt with organizational context and its implications for orga-
nizational effectiveness. As a result, systematic variation in compensation
systems exists across organizations within the same industry. We argue that
outsourcing status is an important contextual factor that affects compensa-
tion systems.

Aside from compensation, strategic HRM researchers have emphasized
the importance of ﬁt between a set of HRM practices and the organizational
context (Schuler and Jackson 1987). In this framework, a compensation
system is likely to be associated with a speciﬁc set of HRM practices that are
aligned with the organizational context. Consistent with this perspective,
some organizational differences in compensation systems may be explained
by organizational decisions about other HRM practices rather than choices
about compensation. Call centre research, however, shows mixed evidence
that compensation management is related to other HRM practices (Batt
2001; Wood et al. 2006). These mixed ﬁndings could be the result of institu-
tional differences or variation in the set of HRM practices included in the
analyses.

Differences in Compensation between In-House and Outsourced Call Centres

Indeed, several factors inﬂuence the outsourcing decision including the need
to increase ﬂexibility in stafﬁng levels, reduce labour costs and capitalize on
economies of scale for providing specialized services (Abraham and Taylor
1996). However, cost savings is a primary motivator for outsourcing (Doell-
gast et al. 2009; Harrison and Kelley 1993). According to transaction cost
economics, organizations outsource work if the costs associated with out-
sourcing (e.g. fees for external suppliers and transaction costs) are less than
the costs associated with internalization (e.g. production costs, acquisition
and maintenance of physical and human assets) (Williamson 1975, 1985). For
outsourced organizations, preserving a cost advantage in order to attract
business is crucial. They can achieve this goal by adopting a low-cost man-
agement system or hiring and developing a high-quality workforce to

improve employee productivity. Nevertheless, efforts to increase productivity
do not alleviate pressures to reduce costs, a critical issue for outsourced call
centres competing with outsourced suppliers in lower-wage countries and
with retaining the work in-house (Batt et al. 2005; Doh 2005). In order to
preserve a cost advantage over their competitors, we expect outsourced call
centres to reduce their labour costs, thereby inﬂuencing them to pay their
CSRs less than their in-house counterparts.

Outsourced call centres’ intention to control employment costs will inﬂu-
ence other aspects of HRM. First, outsourced call centres may hire CSRs
with limited human capital to reduce compensation expenditures and design
customer service work so that low-quality workers can perform tasks (e.g.
standardizing work procedures). Second, they can reduce expenditures asso-
ciated with other HRM practices such as hiring and training costs (Doellgast
et al. 2009). Third, outsourced centres are less likely to be unionized (Doell-
gast 2008), removing potential obstacles preventing the adoption of a low-
cost management system. Together, these choices are likely to be associated
with lower CSR pay, suggesting that these factors may contribute to the
observed pay disparity. However, we argue that outsourced call centres have
a clear intention to reduce employee compensation to support their strategic
orientation (i.e. cost advantage). We control for other HRM practices in our
analysis rather than as outcomes of outsourcing, allowing us to rule out the
possibility that pay-level differences between in-house and outsourced call
centres reﬂect variations in other HRM practices that may result from out-
sourcing decisions.

Little is known about managerial pay in outsourced call centres in com-
parison with their in-house counterparts. On the one hand, limiting com-
pensation for managers could give outsourced call centres an additional
cost advantage over performing the work in-house. On the other hand, a
low-cost operation could also increase CSR dissatisfaction, emotional
exhaustion and burnout
thereby increasing job
demands for managers and, in turn, their compensation expectations. Out-
sourced call centres might choose to suppress manager pay levels to pre-
serve their competitive advantage in the marketplace, but only to the extent
that it avoids difﬁculties in attracting and retaining applicants for manage-
rial positions. Therefore, we expect that outsourced managers are paid less
than in-house managers, but the manager pay differential may be narrower
than the CSR pay differential between in-house and outsourced call
centres.

(Deery et al. 2002),

Consequences of the Outsourced Pay Differential: Quit Rates
and Absenteeism

Outsourced centres paying CSRs less than in-house centres risk an increase in
CSR withdrawal behaviours (e.g. quits and absenteeism). Higher turnover
and absenteeism are especially problematic for call centres because these
behaviours are related to customer turnover (Heskett et al. 1997).

In both organizational-level and individual-level turnover research, the
negative relationship between pay and actual quits is robust (Barber and
Bretz 2000; Griffeth et al. 2000; Shaw et al. 1998). The pay differential is
likely to be associated with higher CSR quit rates in outsourced call centres.
Indeed, Holman et al. (2009) reported that quit rates in outsourced call
centres were higher than in in-house call centres, without controlling for wage
levels. In the present study, we predict higher quit rates in outsourced call
centres compared with in-house call centres and consider lower pay as a
primary explanation for the expected higher quit rates.

Theories offer ambiguous predictions about the relationship between pay
and absenteeism. Equity theory (Adams 1965) suggests that lower pay is
associated with higher absenteeism. In a study of employees working in 500
branches of a Danish bank, Kristensen et al. (2006) found higher rates of
absenteeism in branches with lower salaries. In contrast, economic theory
views absenteeism as an outcome related to the labour supply being inﬂu-
enced by the cost employees incur when they are absent (Allen 1981). Lower
pay may increase absenteeism because employees are unmotivated to attend
work. In the low-wage context, however, employees may lack the ﬁnancial
freedom to be absent. The relationship between pay and absenteeism will
depend on the magnitude of these two opposing effects (Dalton and Perry
1981). Thus, we investigate whether the expected pay disparity is associated
with higher CSR absenteeism in outsourced call centres.

Consequences of the Outsourced Pay Differential: Workforce Performance

The academic literature provides much less guidance on the question of
whether in-house and outsourced organizations differ on workforce perfor-
mance. We expect that the pay disparity between in-house and outsourced
call centres yields variation in workforce performance for several reasons.
First, if lower pay is associated with higher quit rates and absenteeism,
workforce performance is likely to decline accordingly. Several empirical
studies have demonstrated the negative impact of higher quit rates on work-
force performance (Shaw et al. 2005), although few empirical studies examine
the relationship between absenteeism and workforce performance. In addi-
tion to physically withdrawing from the workplace, reducing effort is another
possible employee reaction to lower pay. Consequently, outsourced CSRs
who are paid less than in-house CSRs may perform less well. Second, efﬁ-
ciency wage theory (Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984) points to the possible negative
relationship between pay level and work motivation. Paying above market
pay rates will prevent employees from shirking because they are more inter-
ested in retaining higher-paying jobs. This mechanism is unlikely in out-
sourced call centres, where the cash pay for employees is expected to be
signiﬁcantly lower than in in-house call centres.

Finally, outsourced call centres are more likely to adopt a low-cost HRM
system, and this decision could have a negative effect on workforce perfor-
mance. Extant call centre research shows that using a high-involvement

HRM approach deﬁned by job security, generous compensation, and
empowering employees is associated with improvements in employee and
customer satisfaction, sales productivity, sales growth, service quality,
and net revenues (Batt 2002; Batt and Moynihan 2002). A key component of
the high-involvement HRM approach, a generous pay policy, is likely to be
associated with improved workforce performance. We expect that out-
sourced call centres are less likely to adopt a high-involvement HRM
approach as it could increase employment-related expenditures.

3. Methods

Context

This study is a part of ‘the Global Call Centre Project’ (see Batt et al. 2009 for
details). In comparison with other countries participating in the project,
Canada has a disproportionate share of outsourced call centres (Holman
et al. 2007). Interviews with industry experts uncovered considerable efforts
by economic development agencies in Canada to attract customer service
work from other countries during the 1990s, resulting in the widespread
presence of outsourced call centres (van Jaarsveld et al. 2009).

Sample

The population of this study included all call centres in Canada. Call centres
are an emerging sector with unclear industry boundaries, so conventional
industry classiﬁcations such as the North American Industry Classiﬁcation
System lack a speciﬁc category for call centres (Batt et al. 2009). For this
reason, we developed a database based on membership lists of provincial call
centres and a national governmental-level sector council ‘Contact Centre
Canada’, interviews with industry experts, and Internet research. Our effort
yielded a list of 3,000 call centres spanning all provinces and a wide cross-
section of industries. From this list, we randomly selected 580 call centres to
survey.

We surveyed call centre establishments by phone between February 2005
and July 2006. The establishment level of analysis is appropriate because pay
level is likely to differ across establishments within a single corporation,
reﬂecting variation in the economic environment, and is considered more
reliable than corporate-level surveys (Gerhart et al. 2000a). We supple-
mented the survey developed for the Global Call Centre Project with addi-
tional questions about aspects of compensation and labour market
conditions we address in this article. For inclusion in this study, centres
needed to employ at least 10 employees, and each eligible call centre was
asked to select an individual (e.g. contact centre manager, site director) who
was most familiar with daily operations to complete the survey. We engaged
in site visits to ensure the validity and reliability of our measures.

The response rate was 70 per cent with 406 usable responses, although the
choice of variables reduced the sample to 251 usable cases. The number of
observations removed from the initial sample is slightly higher than in com-
parable studies (Colvin et al. 2001). We used a pairwise t-test to examine
whether signiﬁcant differences existed in our key variables between our ﬁnal
sample and the cases that were removed. We found no signiﬁcant differences
with the exception of CSR absenteeism, which was signiﬁcantly lower in our
ﬁnal sample (p < 0.05). For this reason, the results for CSR absenteeism may
need to be interpreted cautiously.

Measures

Measures used in our analysis are described in the Appendix. Three catego-
ries of dependent variables are (i) CSR and manager pay level; (ii) CSR
withdrawal-related behaviours; and (iii) workforce performance. Pay level
was measured with cash pay and beneﬁts level for CSRs and managers while
CSR withdrawal-related behaviours consisted of CSR quit rate and CSR
absenteeism. Consistent with previous call centre studies (Castilla 2008;
Wood et al. 2006), we used three workforce performance measures: (i) call
abandonment rate; (ii) meeting target time; and (iii) average call handling
time. The independent variable, outsourcing status, indicated whether or not
the call centre was outsourced. In our ﬁnal sample, 37.5 per cent or 94 cases
(out of 251 cases) were outsourced, and 62.5 per cent or 157 cases were
in-house.

We included three categories of control variables: (i) workforce character-
istics; (ii) organizational characteristics; and (iii) HRM practices. Measures
of HRM practices were based on previous call centre studies (Batt 2002;
Colvin et al. 2001).

When estimating pay level and withdrawal-related behaviours, we also
controlled for the economic environment using the 2006 average regional
unemployment rate and 2006 median local earnings data (Statistics Canada
2008). We excluded these labour market variables when estimating
workforce performance because they are unlikely to inﬂuence CSR
performance.2

Analytical Approach

We used (i) ordinary least squares regression to evaluate differences between
in-house and outsourced call centres in CSR cash pay, manager cash pay, and
average call handling time; and (ii) tobit analysis (PROC LIFE REG in SAS,
Ver. 9.1) to analyse CSR beneﬁts level, manager beneﬁts level, CSR quit rate,
CSR absenteeism, call abandonment rate and meeting target time. We used
tobit regression for these variables because meeting target time is both left
and right censored at 0 and 100, while the other variables are left censored at
0 (Maddala 1992).

4. Results

Descriptive Results

Table 1 compares the variables of interest for in-house and outsourced
centres. For easier interpretation, we present the means and the results of
pairwise t-tests calculated before transformation. CSRs and managers
employed in outsourced centres earn signiﬁcantly less cash pay and beneﬁts
than their in-house counterparts. CSR quit rates and CSR absenteeism in
outsourced centres are signiﬁcantly higher than in in-house centres. Consid-
ering workforce performance, the results are mixed with signiﬁcantly lower
call abandonment rates in outsourced call centres and signiﬁcantly shorter
average call handling time in in-house call centres, suggesting that in-house
CSRs handle calls more efﬁciently. Table 2 reports means, standard devia-
tions and correlation matrix.

Multivariate Analysis

(a) Cash pay
In Table 3, we present the results for CSR and manager cash pay. We added
variables in hierarchical order. For CSR cash pay, we added economic envi-
ronment and organizational characteristics including outsourcing status in
Model 1. In Model 2, we added CSR workforce characteristics, and in Model
3, HRM practices. For managers’ cash pay level, we followed the same steps,
but in Model 2 we added managers’ workforce characteristics, and in Model
3, managers’ HRM practices and HRM practices applied to CSRs since
Colvin et al. (2001) found that HRM practices that cover the workforce are
associated with pay for both employees and managers.

In Model 3, we ﬁnd that outsourced call centres pay their CSRs and
managers signiﬁcantly less cash pay than in-house call centres. The beta
coefﬁcients for outsourcing status in Model 3 are very similar when compar-
ing CSR cash pay and manager cash pay (b = -0.099 for both), suggesting
that both outsourced CSRs and managers earn 91 per cent (exp (-0.099)) of
the cash pay their in-house counterparts earn. Contrary to our expectations,
the pay disparity between outsourced and in-house CSRs is similar in
magnitude to the pay disparity between outsourced managers and in-house
managers.

The addition of workforce characteristics and HRM practices consider-
ably reduced the effect of outsourcing status (CSR cash pay: b = -0.163
(Model 1) to b = -0.099 (Model 3); manager cash pay: b = -0.118 (Model 1)
to b = -0.099 (Model 3)). Thus, some of the difference in cash pay for
outsourced CSRs is accounted for by these factors. For example, the number
of emails CSRs receive per day from management and the amount of initial
training for CSRs are both associated with CSRs earning more cash pay. This
pattern could be interpreted as the employer trying to capitalize on em-
ployee contributions to organizational effectiveness as suggested by the

we found that increasing the number of formal training days for CSRs was
negatively related to CSR cash pay level. Managers may need to increase
CSR training to counteract hiring low-quality workers.

(b) Beneﬁts
Table 4 summarizes results for the value of CSR and manager beneﬁts. We
added variables in hierarchical order. For both CSR and manager beneﬁts,
the effect of outsourcing is negative and signiﬁcant in Models 1 and 2;
however, once we included CSR HR practices,
it became insigniﬁcant
(p = 0.26 for CSR beneﬁts; p = 0.22 for manager beneﬁts). Despite being
insigniﬁcant, the signs of the beta coefﬁcients for outsourcing status are
consistently negative, and the size of beta coefﬁcient is similar (b = -0.220 for
CSR beneﬁts and b = -0.225 for manager beneﬁts).

The lower value of beneﬁts offered by outsourced call centres
appears to be accounted for, in part, by other HR practices because their
inclusion resulted in an insigniﬁcant effect of outsourcing on the value of
CSR beneﬁts. For example,
in Model 3, the number of emails CSRs
receive per day from management, job discretion and the use of systematic
selection tests are positively associated with the value of CSR beneﬁts.
Among these variables, the number of emails CSRs receive per day from
management and job discretion are signiﬁcantly associated with outsourc-
ing status as suggested in Table 2. This ﬁnding may suggest that outsourced
call centres use less sophisticated HR systems and may limit beneﬁts for
CSRs. Turning to managers, Model 1 is the best model because neither
Model 2 nor Model 3 improved upon Model 1’s ﬁt. Yet we expected that
outsourced call centres would have a clear intention to constrain employ-
ees’ beneﬁts to preserve a cost advantage over and above hiring different
types of workers and altering other HR practices. We evaluate this expec-
tation in Model 3 by including other HR practices, and we do not ﬁnd
support for it.

(c) CSR quit rates and absenteeism
In Table 5, we display our results for quit rates and absenteeism. In Model 2,
we added CSR cash pay because we are examining whether the pay disparity
between in-house and outsourced centres is associated with quit rates and
absenteeism. In analysing quit rates and absenteeism, we excluded beneﬁts
level to maximize the sample size. We also excluded CSR tenure when esti-
mating quit rates because they are theoretically and empirically related
(Trevor and Nyberg 2008).

CSR quit rates are signiﬁcantly higher in outsourced call centres than in
in-house call centres (Model 1). CSR cash pay is signiﬁcantly associated
with CSR quit rates (Model 2). Adding CSR cash pay reduces the signiﬁ-
cance level of outsourcing status and its beta coefﬁcient by 17 per cent
(b = 0.328 (Model 1); b = 0.271 (Model 2)). As we reported, outsourcing
status is also signiﬁcantly related to CSR cash pay level. These results
suggest that lower pay in outsourced call centres is associated with higher
quit rates.

Absenteeism is also signiﬁcantly higher in outsourced call centres (Model
1). With the addition of CSR cash pay (Model 2), the effect of CSR cash pay
is signiﬁcant and the size of the coefﬁcient for outsourcing status decreased,

supporting our argument that disparity in cash pay accounts for higher rates
of CSR absenteeism in outsourced call centres. The evidence for absenteeism
is somewhat weaker than it is for quit rates as illustrated by a smaller
reduction in the beta coefﬁcient for outsourcing status (b = 0.321 (Model 1);
b = 0.294 (Model 2), about 8.4 per cent).

(d) Workforce performance
Finally, we considered whether lower CSR pay in outsourced call centres is
associated with lower workforce performance. In Table 6, we present two
models for each workforce performance measure. Model 1 excludes CSR
cash pay, while Model 2 includes this variable. Overall, our analysis does not
offer strong evidence that outsourced CSRs perform worse than in-house
CSRs. There is no signiﬁcant difference in call abandonment rate and
meeting the target time between in-house and outsourced call centres,
although average call handling time was longer in outsourced call centres
(p < 0.10).

Compensation in Outsourced Organizations

s19

Our analyses did reveal that CSR cash pay is signiﬁcantly associated with
two workforce performance measures: call abandonment rate and meeting
the target time. Speciﬁcally, higher CSR cash pay leads to a lower call
abandonment rate and an improvement in meeting target times. Employee
compensation appears to have a positive inﬂuence on workforce perfor-
mance, although the effects are not strong enough to yield signiﬁcant differ-
ences in workforce performance between in-house and outsourced call
centres.

5. Discussion and conclusion

Our study expands the understanding of the signiﬁcant disparity in cash pay
between in-house and outsourced organizations. Several new insights about
compensation management in outsourced organizations emerge from our
study. First, we ﬁnd that the inﬂuence of outsourcing status on compensation
is similar for CSRs and managers. Organizations may try to maintain inter-
nal equity so that CSRs and managers in outsourced call centres are consis-
tently compensated in terms of their relative positions to occupational labour
market pay rates.

Second, we compared the value of beneﬁts earned by in-house and out-
sourced CSRs. In contrast to our ﬁndings about cash pay, we found that
in-house CSRs were not compensated with a greater value in beneﬁts com-
pared with their outsourced counterparts. This ﬁnding may be a function of
the institutional context, and considering the same question in the USA or
other countries might yield a different outcome.

Third, we evaluated how compensation and other HRM practices interact
with each other and found some support for the strategic HRM argument
that the organizational context, outsourcing in this study, inﬂuences various
HRM practices simultaneously. CSR cash pay is associated with several
HRM practices. Controlling for other HRM practices besides pay, as well as
other organization-level characteristics, enriches our understanding of the
pay disparity.

Fourth, we evaluated the implications of lower pay in outsourced call
centres. Outsourced call centres experience higher CSR quit rates and absen-
teeism as a result of lower pay. Compared with quit rates, the ability of cash
pay to account for the difference in absenteeism between these two types of
call centres is relatively weaker. This ﬁnding may be the result of a range
restriction problem because our sample consisted of call centres with lower
absenteeism. Alternatively,
in low-wage occupations, employees may
proceed more quickly to other permanent forms of employee withdrawal
such as quitting compared with high-wage occupations where employees can
afford to be absent and quitting could be more costly because fewer alterna-
tive positions are available.

Fifth, CSR cash pay is signiﬁcantly related to workforce performance;
however, the pay disparity between in-house and outsourced call centres is

not ultimately associated with differences in workforce performance. Out-
sourced call centres may use mechanisms that mitigate the effects of negative
outcomes caused by lower pay (e.g. higher quit rates and higher absenteeism)
on workforce performance. Our unreported ad hoc analysis shows that
neither CSR quit rates nor CSR absenteeism is associated with workforce
performance. These ﬁndings suggest that higher quit rates and absenteeism in
outsourced call centres do not culminate in lower workforce performance.
Hence, outsourced call centres may adopt practices that enable them to
effectively handle the workforce churn. This view is consistent with the
conﬁgurational approach (Delery and Doty 1996), which argues that there
are multiple optimal HR systems that allow organizations to achieve
improved performance. Clearly, more in-depth studies on the relationship
between HR systems and workforce performance in outsourced organiza-
tions are needed.

Given the connection to the Global Call Centre Project, we can place these
ﬁndings in a broader context. Extant studies typically examine global out-
sourcing with service work being outsourced from developed countries (e.g.
USA) to low-wage countries (e.g. India) (Batt et al. 2005). By contrast, this
study examined pay disparity within a country and found that domestic
outsourcing is also associated with lower pay, less high-involvement HRM
and higher employee withdrawal. Indeed, evidence of a wage premium for
CSRs employed in in-house call centres when compared with outsourced call
centres in 15 countries is a consistent ﬁnding with three exceptions: Israel, the
UK and India (Batt and Nohara 2009). The magnitude of this wage premium
varies across the countries participating in the study (Batt and Nohara 2009).
Along with outsourcing status, each country’s unique institutional setting
also serves as a context that affects outsourced call centres’ compensation
decisions.

This study has several limitations. First, our analysis relied on a single
respondent, which could introduce possible systematic and unsystematic
biases (Gerhart et al. 2000a,b). We used techniques to reduce measurement
errors, yet having multiple respondents for each establishment would
increase the reliability of our data. Second, cross-sectional data and using call
centres that have already decided whether to retain customer service in-house
or outsource it altogether limits the claims we can make about causality.
Third, our study relied on data from call centres, and replicating these results
with other industries would strengthen our argument.

This study provides valuable insights about the difference in compensation
management between in-house and outsourced service organizations for
employees and managers. The unique outsourcing context plays a key role in
the determination of compensation systems. Outsourcing status has been
typically captured as a consequence of organizational strategic decisions, but,
as shown by this study, it has important implications for management
practices.

Notes

1. Berlinski (2008) examined the provision of a few beneﬁt programmes (i.e. employer
provided health insurance and pension) but did not examine the value of the entire
beneﬁts package.

2. We also ran analyses with the unemployment rate and median local income and

conﬁrmed that they failed to improve the ﬁt of the models.

3. The unemployment rate was derived from provincial health regions, whereas the
median local earnings was calculated using municipalities with a population of at
least 5,000 (Statistics Canada 2008).
