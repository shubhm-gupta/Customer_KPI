ABSTRACT. This study examines whether corporate
social responsibility (CSR) towards primary stakeholders
influences the financial and the non-financial perfor-
mance (NFP) of Indian firms. Perceptual data on CSR
and NFP were collected from 150 senior-level Indian
managers including CEOs through questionnaire survey.
Hard data on financial performance (FP) of the companies
were obtained from secondary sources. A questionnaire
for assessing CSR was developed with respect to six
investors,
stakeholder groups – employees, customers,
community, natural environment,
and suppliers. A
composite measure of CSR was obtained by aggregating
the six dimensions. Findings indicate that stock-listed
firms show responsible business practices and better FP
than the non-stock-listed firms. Controlling confounding
effects of
stock-listing, ownership, and firm size, a
favorable perception of managers towards CSR is found
to be associated with increase in FP and NFP of firms.
Such findings hold good when CSR is assessed for the six
stakeholder groups in aggregate and for each stakeholder
group in segregate. Findings
that responsible
business practices towards primary stakeholders can be
profitable and beneficial to Indian firms.

Introduction

The relation between corporate social responsibility
(CSR) and ﬁrm performance has evoked much
interest among researchers. While some studies
reveal a positive relation between the two constructs
(Graves and Waddock, 1994; Grifﬁn and Mahon,
1997; McGuire et al., 1988; Waddock and Graves,
1997),
indicate a negative relation
(Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Wright and Ferris,

some others

1997), and still others (Aupperle et al., 1985; Teoh
et al., 1999) establish no relation between the two
constructs. Though a positive relation between CSR
and ﬁrm performance has prevailed in many studies
(Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003),
results still remain inconclusive (Margolis and Walsh,
2003; Vogel, 2005). Such inconclusiveness creates
ground for further investigation.

Corporate social responsibility is predominantly
considered as a western phenomenon due to strong
institutions, standards, and appeal systems which are
weak in developing countries of Asia (Chapple and
Moon, 2005). Such weak standards pose considerable
challenge to ﬁrms for practicing CSR in developing
countries of Asia including India. Though extensive
research on CSR inﬂuencing ﬁrm performance has
been carried out in developed countries (Belal, 2001),
there is a dearth of such studies in India. Current
research on CSR in India is mostly limited to self-
reported questionnaire surveys on CSR (Khan and
Atkinson, 1987; Krishna, 1992), nature and charac-
teristics of CSR in India (Arora and Puranik, 2004;
Sood and Arora, 2006), and policies and practices of
multi-national corporations (MNCs) towards CSR in
India (CREM, 2004) without linking it with ﬁrm
performance. This study intends to ﬁll that gap. It
replicates and extends the past ﬁndings (Tsang and
Kwan, 1999) on CSR and ﬁrm performance of
western counties. It is intended to be carried out in a
different country, in a different time period, in dif-
ferent industries, and using different measures. Such
replications are warranted to establish the external
validity of results and to rebuild the conﬁdence of
researchers and practitioners on earlier ﬁndings.

Operationalization of CSR has often been a
source of debate. Researchers have used various

proxy measures to assess CSR (Aupperle et al., 1985;
Cochran and Wood, 1984; Fomburn and Shanley,
1990; McGuire et al., 1988). After introduction of
the stakeholder concept (Freeman, 1984), reconﬁg-
uration of CSR from stakeholders’ perspective has
given a new direction to the evaluation of CSR
(Clarkson, 1995). Single-dimensional measures of
CSR have been replaced by multi-dimensional
measures of CSR that include various stakeholder
issues. However,
studies using the stakeholders’
perspective often aggregate the dimensions of CSR
towards various stakeholders to one composite index
while examining its relation with ﬁrm performance
(Cochran and Wood, 1984; Ruf et al., 2001;
Waddock and Graves, 1997). Such aggregation has
facilitated inter-ﬁrm comparison on the level of
CSR displayed by ﬁrms. However, such aggregation
has
‘masking individual dimensions’
of CSR related to speciﬁc stakeholder groups
(Galbreath, 2006). With aggregation, a ﬁrm’s high
level of CSR may be driven by favorable CSR
policies and practices towards a few stakeholders
leaving the issue of other stakeholders fully or par-
tially unattended. Analyzing the inﬂuence of such
skewed measures of CSR on ﬁrm performance may
not reﬂect a true relation between the two con-
structs. This necessitates examining the inﬂuence of
individual dimensions of CSR on ﬁrm performance.
Only few studies have examined the relation
between individual CSR dimensions and ﬁrm per-
formance (Berman et al., 1999; Graaﬂand and van de
Ven, 2006). This study examines the inﬂuence of
individual as well as aggregate CSR dimensions on
ﬁrm performance.

the risk of

Past research has mostly used ﬁnancial perfor-
mance (FP) measures to assess ﬁrm performance.
However, due to the historical nature and rigidity of
most of the ﬁnancial measures, assessment of non-
ﬁnancial performance (NFP) along with FP is nee-
ded to evaluate ﬁrm performance (Govindarajan and
Gupta, 1985; Ittner and Larcker, 1998). Because
CSR leads

company such as corporate reputation and image
(Schwaiger, 2004), increased employee motivation
(Epstein and Roy, 2001), improved brand image
(Heal, 2005) and the like, NFP that assesses intan-
gible beneﬁts/assets is likely to be inﬂuenced by
CSR. While the inﬂuence of CSR on FP is a widely
researched area (Zahra and LaTour, 1987),

inﬂuence on NFP is a sparsely investigated topic.
This study examines the inﬂuence of CSR on both
FP and NFP of Indian companies.

Conceptual background and hypotheses
development

CSR in India

Asian ﬁrms often lag behind their Western coun-
terparts on CSR practices (KPMG, 2005). However,
advent of liberalization and globalization, entry of
MNCs in Asian markets, rising consumer expecta-
tions towards business, and emergence of pressure
groups have made the case of CSR stronger in Asian
countries including India. But Indian companies
mostly focus their CSR activities on community
development (PiC, 2004). Philanthropic orientation
of Indian businessmen has its roots in history. In the
early nineteenth century India, CSR was mainly
found in the form of philanthropic contributions by
Gujrati and Parsi merchant communities, who pro-
vided funds for building schools, pilgrim rest houses,
places of worship like temples, distributing relief
items during disasters, and helping the poor.

A 20-country public opinion survey ﬁnds that
India is the last in the level of CSR demanded from
companies in any country (Environics International,
2001). A lack of provable link between CSR and
ﬁrm performance often discourages companies from
engaging in CSR (British Council et al., 2002).
Obstacles to CSR are found to be ad hoc approach by
the top management towards CSR, lack of con-
sensus on priorities within the ﬁrm, and problems
related to measurement and evaluation of CSR
activities (Krishna, 1992). Unclear policies, bureau-
cracy, poor monitoring, complicated tax systems,
and poor infrastructure are a few more hindering
factors (CSM, 2001). However, there is a growing
feeling among the Indians that business organiza-
tions must play a wider role in the society besides
providing quality products
reasonable rates,
making their operations environmentally sound,
adhering to high labor standards, and reducing hu-
man rights abuses at the work place (Kumar et al.,
2001). Consequently, Indian companies have started
changing their outlook towards CSR by look-
ing beyond passive philanthropy. Companies are

considering CSR for improved brand image and
stronger ties with the local community (British
Council et al., 2002; PiC, 2004).

CSR from stakeholders’ perspective

tight

The approach of business organizations to CSR has
transcended from merely displaying social concerns
to being sensitive and alert to the constituents in the
internal and external business environment. These
constituents, known as stakeholders, are potent for-
ces to accelerate or decelerate a ﬁrm’s performance.
With globalization of national boundaries
and
information technology revolution, companies are
under
scrutiny from multiple stakeholders
including regulators, investors, customers, pressure
groups, and the public at large. Corporate scandals
are making big news leading to crumbling of well-
settled business empires. Recent sub-prime crisis in
the US and the subsequent crashing of stock indices
of companies across the globe is a case in point.
When stakeholders
loose conﬁdence in a ﬁrm’s
performance,
support
structure and customer base (Lee, 2008). Customers
stop buying products or go for legal suits, share-
holders sell their stocks, employees do not perform,
and environmental advocates sue (Wood, 1991), all
of which directly affect ﬁrm performance. This
warrants pursuing meaningful and long-term rela-
tions with stakeholders.

the ﬁrm loses

its critical

A ﬁrm’s survival and success depends on the ability
of its managers to create sufﬁcient wealth and satis-
faction for its primary stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995).
Primary stakeholders of a ﬁrm include employees,
shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities, and
natural environment. If any of the primary stake-
holder groups withdraws its support to the ﬁrm, the
ﬁrm’s operation is adversely affected (Clarkson,
1995). Firms that establish relationship with primary
stakeholders beyond market transactions gain com-
petitive advantage (Barney and Hansen, 1994;
Fomburn and Shanley, 1990). Effective management
of key stakeholders acts as a value driver by leveraging
performance

costs. Lower employee turnover reduces hiring and
training costs, loyal suppliers reduce quality certiﬁ-
cation costs, supportive communities reduce legal
and public relations overhead, and stable shareholders

and reducing

reduce stock market volatility (McVea and Freeman,
2005). In order to achieve sustainability in business,
ﬁrms must identify key stakeholders affecting the
ﬁrm, identify their needs, and design organizational
policies and practices to cater to them. Accordingly,
we deﬁne CSR towards a particular stakeholder
group as a ﬁrm’s policies, processes, and practices
towards that stakeholder group. The study recognizes
primary stakeholders as key stakeholders and deﬁnes
CSR from their perspective.

Measurement of CSR

Past studies on CSR have often been criticized for
using inappropriate measures of CSR. Researchers
have used various proxy measures to assess CSR: (a)
one-dimensional surrogate measures such as repu-
tation ranking of companies on pollution control
performance (Chen and Metcalf, 1980; Freedman
and Jaggi, 1982), (b) Moskowitz’s social responsi-
bility ratings (Cochran and Wood, 1984; Mosko-
witz, 1972), and (c) Fortune corporate reputation
index (Fomburn and Shanley, 1990; McGuire et al.,
1988). These measures have been criticized for
their inability to incorporate stakeholders’
issues
(Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullman, 1985). To overcome
such inadequacies, recent studies (Ruf et al., 2001;
Waddock and Graves, 1997) use CSR data devel-
oped by various agencies that evaluate CSR from
stakeholders’ perspective such as the KLD database
of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc. (Kinder
et al., 2005).

compact,

Voluntary standards such as ISO 14000, OHSAS
18000, Social Accountability (SA) 8000 (SAI, 2001),
United Nations’ global
and Global
Reporting Initiative guidelines (GRI, 2002) outline
a wide range of responsible business practices related
to stakeholder issues such as environment, occupa-
tional health and safety, labor, human rights, cor-
ruption, etc. In recent years, an increasing number of
companies are making CSR disclosures as per these
standards. Nearly 90% of Fortune 500 ﬁrms make
CSR disclosures in their annual reports (Boli and
Hartsuiker, 2001). However, Indian companies lag
behind their global counterparts in terms of CSR
disclosure. A recent survey of 27 companies by
KPMG ﬁnds that only 25% of the companies are
signatories to GRI guidelines, 8% mention about

in India. There are two
widely used secondary database on Indian compa-
nies, Prowess database of Centre for Monitoring
Indian Economies
(Prowess, 2005) and
India Business Insight Database (IBID) of Infor-
matics India Limited (2003). The former gives access
to corporate governance reports and the latter
includes newspaper articles on corporate activities
including CSR initiatives. Number of mandatory
standards included in the Indian Companies Act,
1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI) guidelines, various pollution prevention acts,
and the like give dispersed ideas about the respon-

sibilities of Indian companies
stake-
holders.
this
study develops a
comprehensive measure of CSR towards each pri-
mary stakeholder group incorporating corresponding
social, ethical, legal, and economic issues derived
from local and global standards.

In this context,

Firm performance

Grifﬁn and Mahon (1997) have reviewed 51 studies
on CSR–ﬁrm performance relationship and found
that as many as 80 different types of FP measures
have been used. Firm size, return on assets (ROA),
return on equity, asset age, and return on sales are
the frequently used FP measures. Particularly, ROA
is consistently claimed to be an authentic measure of
FP (Berman et al., 1999; McGuire et al., 1988).
Unlike other accounting measures such as return on
equity or return on sales, ROA is not affected by the
differential degree of leverage present in ﬁrms. Be-
cause ROA is positively correlated with the stock
price, a higher ROA implies higher value creation
for shareholders. Moreover,
in asset-heavy ﬁrms
such as the manufacturing ﬁrms, ROA is a better
indicator of ﬁrm performance.

Financial performance measures are lag indicators
and capture historical performance arising from
mostly tangible assets (Ong, 2003). They often fail to
properly record performance from intangible assets
such as customer relationships, employee satisfaction,
innovation, investment in research and development,
and the like that have become signiﬁcant sources of

factors

such as

competitive advantage for ﬁrms in recent times (Lev,
2000). In contrast, NFP measures focus on a ﬁrm’s
long-term success
research and
development, customer satisfaction, internal business
process efﬁciency, innovation, and employee satis-
faction, and capture performance improvements
from intangible assets (Kaplan and Norton, 2001).
Investments in intangible assets such as research and
development are expensed immediately instead of
getting capitalized in the traditional accounting sys-
tem. Such treatment of intangible assets depresses the
proﬁt in the current year though beneﬁts from such
investments accrue to the ﬁrm over a long period of
time. By accounting for such performance improve-
ments, NFP measures provide indirect indicators of
ﬁrm performance. Because of their focus on conse-
quences rather than causes of performance, NFP
measures are considered as ‘lead indicators’ (Ittner
and Larcker, 2000). FP measures are objective in
nature whereas NFP measures are subjective in nat-
ure that includes managers’ perception of ﬁrm per-
formance on market share, employee health and
safety, investment in research and development, and
others. Perceptual data on NFP from senior managers
correlate with hard data on FP from secondary
sources (Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1987) sug-
gesting their complementarity. Hence, FP measures
along with NFP measures are used to assess ﬁrm
performance holistically (Govindarajan and Gupta,
1985; Ittner and Larcker, 1998).

CSR and ﬁrm performance

The relations between CSR and FP are mostly
inconclusive, but positive relations between the two
have been reported in most of the studies (Margolis
and Walsh, 2003) suggesting an instrumental orien-
tation of CSR initiatives. An instrumental orienta-
tion towards CSR suggests the alignment of the
social goal with the business goal where CSR is
considered as a strategic tool to promote the eco-
nomic objective of the ﬁrm. Managers foresee sig-
niﬁcant value additions in ﬁrm performance due to
strengthened stakeholder
relations. Management
theorists argue that by improving CSR towards
stakeholders, ﬁrm performance

(Boulding and Kirmani, 1993)

The inﬂuence of stakeholder-oriented CSR on
ﬁrm performance can be understood with the help
of three theories: (a) consumer inference making, (b)
signaling theory, and (c)
identity theory.
‘Consumer inference making’ theory suggests that if
a consumer knows that the manufacturer of the
product is a responsible ﬁrm, s/he can infer posi-
tively about the product (Brown and Dacin, 1997).
Such inferences induce consumer goodwill (Brown
and Dacin, 1997; Handelman and Arnold, 1999) that
inﬂuences purchase intention (Gildea, 1994; Owen
and Scherer, 1993). ‘Signaling’ theory (Boulding and
Kirmani, 1993; Kirmani, 1997) suggests that in situ-
information asymmetry
ations where
between buyers and sellers, consumers
look for
information/signals that distinguish companies per-
forming well on attributes of interest compared to
companies performing poorly. Signals such as war-
ranties
indicating
reliability and higher quality of products enable
consumers
to decide between companies. Con-
sumers associate higher product quality with proac-
tive corporate citizenship (Maignan and Ferrell,
2001) and potential job-seekers value CSR record of
companies as a signal for organizational attractiveness
(Greening and Turban, 2000; Turban and Greening,
1997). ‘Social identity’ theory emphasizes that one’s
self-concept is inﬂuenced by membership in differ-
ent social organizations, including the company for
which an individual works (Ashforth and Mael,
1989; Dutton et al., 1994). Employees’ self-image is
inﬂuenced by the image and reputation of their
employers, consumers
identify themselves with
organizations or brands involved in discretionary
citizenship (Aaker, 1994; Belk, 1988), and institu-
tional investors like to be associated with socially
responsible ﬁrms (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Teoh
and Shiu, 1990). Such bonds of
identiﬁcation
encourage positive evaluations of a ﬁrm’s products,
and reap value addition through customer loyalty,
advocacy, positive words-of-mouth, and resilience
to negative brand information (Hoefﬂer and Keller,
2002; Sen et al., 2006).

Alternatively,

irresponsible behavior by ﬁrms
agitates stakeholders. They often react by boycotting
the company (Hayes and Pereira, 1990), reducing
consumption of the company’s products (Sen and
Bhattacharya, 2001), initiating legal action against
the company (Greeno and Robinson, 1992), and/or

spreading bad words-of-mouth about irresponsible
business practices (Clair et al., 1995). Boycotting of
Nike products due to human rights’ abuse and unsafe
working conditions at suppliers’ locations in Asia
(Herbert, 1996), or sharp reaction from environ-
mentalists and consumers to the pesticide content in
Pepsi and Coca-Cola beverages in India (Financial
Express, 2006) are few such instances. While
improved stakeholder relations have the potential to
improve a ﬁrm’s
reputation and performance,
strained relations have the risk of adversely affecting
a ﬁrm’s performance. Hence, we propose:

H1: The favorable CSR towards stakeholders will

positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP.

Because we have considered CSR towards six
groups of stakeholders, let us examine the relation-
ship between CSR towards each stakeholder group
and ﬁrm performance.

CSR towards employees and ﬁrm performance
Proactive policies and practices towards employees
reﬂect a company’s intention to address the interests
of its employees and satisfy their needs. Policies and
practices towards union relations, employees’ par-
ticipation in decision making, remuneration policy,
working conditions, and elimination of forced/child
labor, portray a ﬁrm’s CSR towards employees. By
adhering to such standards, ﬁrms can satisfy employ-
ees, enhance their job performance, and improve FP
and NFP. The Energy Research Institute’s report
mentions that Indian stakeholders including work-
ers, company executives, and general public feel that
Indian companies should adhere to higher labor
standards and reduce human rights abuses at the
workplace (Kumar et al., 2001). Working conditions
that respect human dignity, equality, and social
protection result in a productive workplace (Som-
avia, 2000). Social responsibility of a company is a
reputation factor and is an attractive force for
potential
(Turban and
Greening, 1997). Ethical reputation contributes to
job satisfaction and lower employee turnover by
evoking positive reactions from employees’ families
and friends (Riordan et al., 1997). Because satisﬁed
employees have higher morale and job motivation,
they will work more effectively and efﬁciently
(Berman et al., 1999) and contribute to higher levels

and current employees

of organizational effectiveness (Koys, 2001). Past
studies establish that better human resource man-
agement practices such as training and development
of employees, their participation in problem solving,
progressive remuneration policies, and grievance
procedures
increases
their productivity and FP (Huselid, 1995; Youndt
et al., 1996). A better CSR towards employees
which includes wider issues compared to human
resource management issues also improves a ﬁrm’s
FP (Berman et al., 1999). Hence,

H1.1: The favorable CSR towards employees will

positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP.

CSR towards customers and ﬁrm performance
Positive customer perception about product quality
and safety leads to increased sales or decreased costs
associated with stakeholder relationships (Waddock
and Graves, 1997). Higher product safety and quality
improves the bottom line (Berman et al., 1999). In
product retailing, market reactions are found to
be negative for
socially irresponsible companies
(Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Davidson and Worell,
1988). When customers are dissatisﬁed with a
product or its associated services, investors appre-
hend that negative customer reactions in the form of
decreased patronage, lawsuits, or both, will directly
affect the bottom line (Berman et al., 1999). Event
studies establish that market value of a company
decreases when corporate irresponsibility and illegal
behavior is observed (Frooman, 1997). The news of
pesticide content in Pepsi and Coca-Cola beverages
in India reduced the sales of both companies by 60%
(Financial Express, 2006). Continuous deterioration
in quality directly affects ﬁrm performance (Landon
and Smith, 1997). Hence, companies need to be
careful about
such as ethical advertising
standards, customer health and safety during product
use, company-wide quality programs for providing
better products at right prices and the like. Company
policies and practices to address such issues give a
positive signal about a company’s responsible atti-
tude towards its customers and can improve ﬁrm
performance. Hence,

CSR towards investors and ﬁrm performance
Firms can strengthen their investor relations by
adopting proper governance standards. After the
corporate governance debacles in 1990s such as that
of Enron in the US, the stock market crisis in India,
and falling corporate governance standards across
the globe, a lot of importance is being given to
governance codes and laws
for protecting the
interests of shareholders and investors. These codes
stress the need for transparency in ﬁnancial and
non-ﬁnancial disclosures, adoption of internation-
ally compatible accounting standards, appropriate
board processes
and
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
CSR towards investors examine ﬁrm policies and
practices towards such issues including shareholders’
inde-
participation in decision making, auditors’
pendence, and policies
trading.
Evidence suggests that adoption of better corporate
governance standards increases ﬁrm performance.
Investors show willingness to pay a premium for the
stocks of well-governed companies compared to
poor-governed companies (Coombes and Watson,
2000). Companies with the highest rankings
in
good governance practices also have the highest FP
(Business Week, 2002). Positive relations are found
between corporate governance and stock price
performance and ﬁnancial ratios in emerging mar-
kets (CLSA, 2000). Companies ranked in the top
quarter of corporate governance yield a better
average return on capital employed compared to
companies ranked in the bottom half (CLSA, 2000).
Companies that comply with the Cadbury Com-
mittee recommendations
in the UK experience
better performance as compared to the non-
complying ﬁrms (Dahya and McConnell, 2007).
Past research on the inﬂuence of corporate gover-
nance indicators such as board size on ﬁrm per-
formance has yielded both positive (Dalton et al.,
1998) and negative outcomes (Alshimmiri, 2004).
However, in the Indian context, studies suggest that
properly designed mandatory corporate governance
reforms increase share prices (Black and Khanna,
2007). Market value of Indian companies such as
Infosys that follows stricter governance and disclo-
sure standards increased as high as 2000 times while
that of poor governed ﬁrms declined as low as 95%
during 1995–2000 (Nemkumar, 2000). Hence,

CSR towards community and ﬁrm performance
Typical involvement of business with the commu-
nity is seen in areas of education, health, and income
generation. CSR towards community is seen in
terms of philanthropic giving, public–private part-
nerships, community relationships, and participation
in social and economic development issues. Of late,
companies are pursuing meaningful partnerships
with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to
empower the local community. Endeavors by Indian
companies such as Kishan Kendras1 by Tata group,
e-Choupals and KisanIndia.com by ITC, Shubh Labh2
services by Mahindra, and Kisan Kendra by Ralli
empower rural Indian farmers (Singh and Bhagat,
2004). Initiatives by MNCs
such as Microsoft’s
partnership with an NGO, Pratham, to promote
quality primary education in rural India (Brugmann
and Prahalad, 2007) or Hewlett Packard’s living lab
experiment with women self-help groups in rural
Andhra Pradesh (India) to provide them sustainable
livelihoods (Dunn and Yamashita, 2003) are few
more examples. When ﬁrms
social
actions on communities in and around their area of
operation,
they reap the beneﬁts of a socially
responsible image among their employees and the
local community (Husted, 2003). Partnership of Life
Insurance Corporation of India with micro-credit
federations
in the rural Andhra Pradesh, besides
improving its penetration of the rural market and
expanding the customer base, has also increased its
gross margin by 27% (Brugmann and Prahalad,
2007). Indian Market Research Bureau ﬁnds that
after Hindustan Lever Limited, a fast moving con-
sumer goods company, launched an initiative called
‘Project Shakti’
rural
women in India, the consumption of its products
increased in the range 15–20% (Sood and Arora,
2006). Though past evidence suggests a negative
relation between CSR towards the community and
ﬁrm performance (Berman et al., 1999), it is also
observed that investments in community develop-
ment activities help a ﬁrm to obtain competitive
advantages through tax savings, decreased regulatory
burden, and improvements in the quality of local
labor (Waddock and Graves, 1997). Hence,

CSR towards environment and ﬁrm performance
Recent years have seen mounting global pressure for
enactment and adoption of stricter legislations per-
taining to environment protection in and around the
globe. Companies are taking proactive initiatives for
emission reduction in anticipation of future policy,
and societal and competitive developments with
respect to environment. With increasing importance
of environmental friendly products, processes, and
services, ﬁrms are realizing the importance of adopt-
ing environmental standards for their sustainability in
the long run. This has facilitated development of
green resources and capabilities and compliance with
international standards such as ISO 14000, OHSAS
18000, and environmental
legislations. Environ-
mental performance is enhanced by improvements in
three aspects – (a) product technologies such as use of
recycled raw materials and other resource saving
programs, (b) process technologies such as use of
efﬁcient production systems and end-of-pipe con-
trols, and (c) management systems such as workers’
training programs and environmental audit. Global
standards on CSR towards environment endorse
these aspects. Research on environmental proactivity
has not been conclusive (Christman, 2000). But
studies link environmental commitment with en-
hanced proﬁtability, particularly in high growth
industries (Russo and Fouts, 1997). Evidence suggests
proactive environment management enhances ﬁrm’s
market value (Klassen and Mc Laughlin, 1996), rep-
utation, and FP (Alvarez et al., 2001; Miles and Co-
vin, 2000). The

CSR towards suppliers and ﬁrm performance
Inﬂuence of suppliers has become crucial in recent
years as companies have started focusing more
on their core competencies, outsourcing other

Standards on CSR towards

functions to suppliers (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990).
Recent years have seen growing importance of
suppliers’ issues such as health and safety, environ-
mental
impact, community involvement, and the
payment of living wages to employees at both out-
sourced plant locations and home locations of sup-
pliers.
suppliers
incorporate such issues besides including issues such
as ethical procurement of raw materials by suppliers,
and elimination of child labor and human rights’
violation at suppliers’ locations. By ensuring adher-
ence of CSR standards by suppliers, a ﬁrm sends
strong signals about its commitment towards CSR,
which improves its image and performance. Viola-
tion of CSR standards by suppliers adversely affects a
ﬁrm’s performance. Banning of Indian carpet-mak-
ing ﬁrms by international buyers for their use of
child labor in carpet making is a case in point.
International buyers prefer Rugmark certiﬁcation
which ensures that a ﬁrm has not used child labor.
Such preferences improve ﬁrm performance. Hence,

H1.6: The favorable CSR towards suppliers will

positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP
(Figure 1).

Control variable

First, ﬁrms that are listed in stock exchanges tend to
disclose more CSR related information compared to
the non-listed ﬁrms as performance of listed ﬁrms is
continuously monitored and evaluated by multiple
stakeholders
investors, ﬁnancial analysts,

such as

and higher

media, and the like. Positive CSR disclosures have
positive inﬂuence on stock prices (Anderson and
Frankle, 1980; Shane and Spicer, 1983). Better CSR
of a ﬁrm inﬂuences investment decisions of institu-
tional investors by improving a ﬁrm’s access to capital
(Graves and Waddock, 1994; Pava and Krausz, 1996)
and reducing the cost of capital. Thus stock-listing of
companies inﬂuences both CSR and ﬁrm perfor-
mance. Second, type of ownership of companies,
state-owned or private-owned, affects both the CSR
and ﬁrm performance. State-owned enterprises
(SOEs), which laid the foundation of industrializa-
tion in India, coexist with private sector companies in
many key sectors. SOEs are generally identiﬁed with
characteristics such as larger work force, stronger
labor laws, employee-friendly work environment
and beneﬁt plans,
investment on
peripheral development. Private sector companies lag
with respect to such characteristics. Proﬁt motive is
not the primary focus of SOEs like private enter-
prises. This suggests the prevalence of more CSR in
SOEs compared to private enterprises. In a review of
54 studies in different countries on SOE versus pri-
vate sector performance, 32 show private companies
to be more proﬁtable than SOEs (Boardman and
Vining, 1989). Similar ﬁndings are concurred in the
Indian manufacturing sector (Ganesh, 2001). This
suggests that type of ownership affects both CSR and
ﬁrm performance. Third, ﬁrm size also inﬂuences
CSR (Fomburn and Shanley, 1990) and ﬁrm per-
formance (Robins and Wiersema, 1995). Larger
ﬁrms are relatively better positioned than smaller
ﬁrms to invest more funds for CSR activities. Past
research has considered annual sales (Fomburn and
Shanley, 1990), total assets, and number of employees
(Waddock and Graves, 1997) as indicators of ﬁrm
size. Because listing in stock exchanges, type of
ownership, and ﬁrm size are likely to inﬂuence CSR
and ﬁrm performance, without controlling their
confounding effects, the CSR-ﬁrm performance link
cannot be gauged appropriately.

(a) minimum capital

CMIE, the largest database of Indian companies.
Three criteria were set for inclusion of companies in
the sample:
investment of
250 million (Indian rupees), (b) a minimum number
of 100 employees in the ﬁrm, and (c) a minimum of
5 years of manufacturing operation. Such criteria
excluded small ﬁrms and start-up units from the
sample. As per
the Prowess database (Prowess,
2005), there are 2932 manufacturing companies in
India with a minimum capital investment of 250
million (Indian rupees). Out of these, 85 companies
are SOEs and the rest are private sector enterprises.
Fifteen hundred companies (51% of the total num-
ber of companies
in Prowess) were randomly
selected from the database representing 18 categories
of manufacturing industries. Out of
the selected
companies, 150 companies responded to the ques-
tionnaire survey and the response rate was 10%. Out
of the 150 respondent companies, 31 were SOEs and
119 were private sector enterprises, and 101 were
listed in Indian stock exchanges (Bombay Stock
Exchange and National Stock Exchange), and 49
were not listed in any stock exchange. As CSR
decisions are mainly taken by the top management in
ﬁrms, CEOs and in their absence senior executives
such as vice-presidents, directors,
senior general
managers, or general managers participated in the
survey. Data were collected from industrial belts of
eight major cities situated in six states out of 35 states
and union territories representing India.

A web-enabled version of the questionnaire was
developed and sent through e-mail to 900 companies
which had e-mail ids. After three reminders over a
period of 2 months, only 23 (2.5%) CEOs returned
the ﬁlled-in questionnaires through e-mail. Ques-
tionnaires were sent
to another 600 companies
by post which did not have any e-mail id. Though
return envelopes along with postage were attached
with the questionnaire, only 10 companies returned
the ﬁlled-in questionnaires within a period of
4 months. Finally, out of the non-responding com-
panies, 400 companies were directly contacted by the
researcher at their corporate head ofﬁces in the north,
south, and east zones of India. Prior communication
was made to companies through e-mail or telephone,
and appointments were ﬁxed with the top executives.
In the ﬁrst meeting with the senior executives, the
researcher left the questionnaire with them after
explaining the objective of the survey. Because the

questionnaire covered a wide range of issues con-
cerning different departments such as the human
resource department (employees), marketing depart-
ment (customers), purchase department (suppliers),
and the like, the executives took time to ﬁll up the
data in consultation with the concerned departments.
After a period of 2 weeks, respondents were con-
tacted to return the ﬁlled-in questionnaires. From the
400 companies, ﬁlled-in questionnaires were pro-
cured from 117 companies. All in all, 150 (23 + 10 +
117) questionnaires were obtained.

Demographic details of executives were collected
as part of the questionnaire survey. Data on age,
years of service, education, and monthly salary of
CEOs and top-level executives (M age = 49.53,
SD = 7.13; M years of
service = 13.79, SD =
10.19; M years of formal study = 18.74, SD = 2.22)
were obtained through questionnaire
surveys.
Among the respondents, 92% had at least one pro-
fessional qualiﬁcation like engineering or manage-
ment degree. Average monthly gross
salary of
respondents in various industries varied from as low
as 35,000 (Indian rupees) to as high as 1,257,261
(Indian rupees). Respondents were male members in
146 of the 150 ﬁrms indicating the low representa-
tion of women in the top management. The sam-
ple companies had a minimum number of 105
employees and a maximum number of 446,721
employees. The public sector companies had aver-
age employee strength of 22,026 within a range
265–446,721. The average employee strength in
private sector companies was 2227 within a range
105–40,000. The average employee strength in the
18 categories of industries was within a range 270–
7953. The sample proﬁle of the 18 categories of
industries is summarized in Table I.

Measures

Besides socio-demographic variables of the respon-
dents, data on CSR towards different stakeholders
along with NFP were procured through question-
naire. Respondents were assured complete ano-
nymity of their responses.

covered under various global standards such as KLD
database (Kinder et al., 2005), GRI guidelines (GRI,
2002), SA 8000 (SAI, 2001), and relevant ISO
standards. We also referred to local standards speci-
ﬁed in the Indian Companies Act, 1956, the SEBI
guidelines, and pollution prevention acts in India
with respect to air, water, and noise, and voluntary
codes such as the UNDP–CII social code for busi-
ness,
jointly developed by the Confederation of
Indian Industries (CII) and United Nations Devel-
opment Program (UNDP). In addition, the 27-item
scale developed by Benito and Benito (2005) was
adopted for the environmental section of the ques-
tionnaire.

An initial pool of 70 items was reduced to 61 after
pilot testing of the questionnaire in 10 companies.
The 61 items were given to three experts working in
the area of CSR. They were asked to judge the
appropriateness of the items to assess CSR of Indian
manufacturing companies
the six stake-
holders. All these items were agreed to by the three
experts and were retained for the ﬁnal survey. In

addition, the convergent validity of the constructs
was tested by conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA).
Along with descriptive statistics, unstandardized and
standardized regression weights, various ﬁt measures
of goodness of ﬁt index (GFI), comparative ﬁt index
(CFI), normed ﬁt index (NFI), and root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA) of the scales were
obtained (see Table V in Appendix). Minimum of
the model was achieved indicating the ﬁt of each
CSR construct to data. Because items were causal
indicators and not affect
(Bollen and
Lenox, 1991), few items had non-signiﬁcant loadings.
Despite the non-signiﬁcant
loadings, we retained
them because they represented distinct issues relevant
to the stakeholder groups and each construct had high
inter-item consistency (Cronbach alpha ‡0.70).

Corporate social responsibility was measured sep-
arately for each stakeholder (see Table V in Appendix
for item details). Thirteen items assessed CSR towards
employees including issues such as equal opportunity
action plan, anti-discrimination policies, and provi-
sions covering health and safety at work (Cronbach

alpha = 0.74). Seven items examined CSR towards
customers covering issues such as commitment to
provide quality products and services, pricing prod-
ucts as per quality, and voluntary codes for advertising
(Cronbach alpha = 0.70). Seven items evaluated
such as
CSR towards
rules
investor grievance handling policies,
to
independence, and policies

towards prohibiting insider
trading (Cronbach
alpha = 0.72). CSR towards community was evalu-
ated with 12 items comprising issues
such as
supporting third party social and sustainable devel-
opment
initiatives, and community partnerships
(Cronbach alpha = 0.78). Issues such as systems for
measuring environmental performance, end-of-pipe
controls, and environmental training for managers
were included in the 17 items assessing CSR towards
natural environment (Cronbach alpha = 0.91). CSR
towards
suppliers was evaluated on ﬁve items
(Cronbach alpha = 0.76) including issues such as
safety and environmental aspects, and policies on the
restrictions of sweat shop/human rights’ violation at
suppliers’ locations. Each respondent was asked to
endorse the degree of compliance of the ﬁrm with
respect to the issues mentioned in the questionnaire.
Response descriptions against each item were given
on a ﬁve-point scale – ’it is not in the company code’
(=1), ‘it is in the company code but not implemented’
(=2), ‘it is in the company code but partially imple-
mented’ (=3), ‘it is in the company code and sub-
stantially implemented’ (=4), and ‘it is in the company
code and fully implemented’ (=5). The summative
score on all
items of CSR towards a particular
stakeholder group was divided by the number of
items to keep that value within the range of the scale.
Aggregation of CSR in the past research has been
(Moore,
done by (a) adding various dimensions
to the various
2001), and (b) assigning weights
dimensions on the basis of expert panel ratings
(Waddock and Graves, 1997). In order to assess
whether all the dimensions of CSR could be added
to one aggregate variable, CFA was carried out on
the scores of six dimensions of CSR. The relative
chi-square value (v2/df = 3.54) of the one-factor
model was not below the recommended cut-off
criterion of 3. However, the other ﬁt measures –
GFI (=0.92), CFI (=0.96), and NFI (=0.94) – were
above the recommended cut-off criterion of 0.90
(Bollen, 1989)

suggesting the ﬁt of

Moreover, the response descriptions against each
item of CSR measures were on a uniform ﬁve-point
scale. Therefore, the scores on six segregated mea-
sures of CSR were averaged to specify the aggregate
CSR. The inter-item alpha reliability of all the 61
items was high (Cronbach alpha = 0.88).

Firm performance
FP. In order to control industry inﬂuences, FP was
assessed using industry-adjusted ROA.
Industry-
adjusted ROA was obtained by subtracting average
industry ROA of each industry category from the
ROA of each ﬁrm in the corresponding industry
category (Agle et al., 1999; Fowler and Schmidt,
1988). Data on ROA for each of 150 ﬁrms and each
of 18 categories of industries were collected from the
CMIE-Prowess database for 3 years
from 2003–
2004 to 2005–2006. ROA of companies, whose data
were not available in the database, was calculated
from the balance sheets of companies available in
annual reports for the above 3 years as the ratio of
operating income to total assets
[ROA = {Net
operating income 9 (1 - tax rate)}/Average operat-
ing assets] (Copeland et al., 2000). A 3-year average
of ﬁrm-level and industry-level ROAs was obtained
to eliminate possible biases that may result from a
single-year ﬁgure.

NFP. A 12-item scale developed by Govindarajan
(1984) and modiﬁed by Hoque (2004) was considered
to assess the NFP. The 12 items in the modiﬁed ver-
sion are: (1) sales growth rate, (2) market share, (3)
operating proﬁts, (4) workplace relations, (5) cash
ﬂow from operations, (6) return on investment, (7)
new product development, (8) market development,
(9) research and development, (10) cost reduction
programs, (11) personnel development, and (12)
employee health and safety. Senior managers were
requested to indicate the relative position of their
companies with respect to the industry average on
each item. Response descriptions against each item
were given on a ﬁve-point scale – ‘well below average’
(=1), ‘below average’ (=2), ‘average’ (=3), ‘above
average’ (=4), ‘well above average’ (=5). NFP on all
items were obtained for 3 years from 2003–2004 to
2005–2006. The annual average value of NFP
[(NFP2003–2004 + NFP2004–2005 + NFP2005–2006)/3]
for each of the 12 items was calculated. On such
average,
items had high inter-item consistency


582

Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar

(Cronbach alpha = 0.89). The annual average value
of NFP on 12 items was further averaged by dividing it
with the number of items to keep the value within the
range of the scale. High average score indexed high
NFP.

Control variable
Listing in stock exchanges, type of ownership, and
ﬁrm size were the control variables. Data on stock-
listing status, ownership type, and annual sales were
obtained from the CMIE-Prowess database. Data on
number of employees were obtained from the
respondents. Stock-listing status and ownership type
were coded as dummy variables (non-listed = 0,
listed = 1; public = 0, private = 1). Two indicators
of ﬁrm size were considered for the study, (a) number
of employees (as on 31 March, 2006) and (b) average
sales (average of 3 years’ net sales from 2003–2004 to
2005–2006), which were continuous variables. From
the data of annual sales for 3 years, the average annual
sales ﬁgure was considered for analysis.

Results

Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation among
the studied variables are presented (Table II). Posi-
tive correlations were found between stock-listing
status and aggregate CSR indicating that
listed
companies showed a higher CSR. Positive correla-
tions between stock-listing status and FP implied
that listed companies performed better than non-
listed companies. However, stock-listing status did
not relate to NFP. Similarly, the other two control
variables, type of ownership, and the ﬁrm size did
not
relate to FP and NFP. Correlation results
showed that FP and NFP of the companies were
related indicating a higher FP also implied a higher
NFP. The correlation between CSR and ﬁrm per-
formance indicated that a more favorable aggregate
CSR towards all the six stakeholders – employees,
customers, investors, community, environment, and
suppliers – resulted in a higher industry-adjusted
ROA and NFP of the ﬁrms. A favorable CSR
towards each of the six stakeholders also enhanced
the FP and NFP of ﬁrms.

The correlation between two variables incorpo-
rates bidirectional relations that are unreserved in
regression analysis. To examine the inﬂuence of
control variables, aggregate CSR, and segregate
CSR on FP and NFP of ﬁrms, hierarchical regres-
sion analyses were carried out.

In the regression analysis for FP, three control
variables were entered in the ﬁrst step (Table III). In
congruence with the correlation results, of the three
control variables, only stock-listing status of com-
panies positively inﬂuenced FP suggesting that the
listed ﬁrms were ﬁnancially better of than the non-
listed ﬁrms. In the second step of the regression
analysis, partialing out
the inﬂuence of control
variables, an increase in aggregate and segregate
CSR enhanced the FP of ﬁrms.

In the hierarchical regression analysis for NFP,
similar to the results of correlation analysis, none of
the control variables inﬂuenced NFP in the ﬁrst step
(Table IV). But in the second step of the regression
analysis, both aggregate and segregate CSR posi-
tively inﬂuenced the NFP.

Results supported the main hypothesis (H1) and
(H1.1–H1.6). Both aggregate and
its components
segregate CSR predicting FP and NFP were sig-
niﬁcant
the socially responsible
business yielded higher performance of manufac-
turing ﬁrms.

suggesting that

Controlling the confounding effects, aggregate
CSR predicted 12% variance of industry-adjusted
ROA (Table III)
and 20% variance of NFP
(Table IV). The segregate measures of CSR, incor-
porating the CSR towards six stakeholder groups,
explained from as low as 3% to as high as 14% var-
iance of the industry-adjusted ROA and from as low
as 7% to as high as 19% variance of NFP. First, such
ﬁndings suggested that listed ﬁrms had better CSR
and FP than non-listed ones. Second, controlling the
confounding effects, both the aggregate and segre-
gate measures of CSR predicted FP and NFP of
ﬁrms but CSR inﬂuenced the NFP of ﬁrms more
potently compared to FP of ﬁrms. Third, the non-
explained variance of FP and NFP suggested that
there were other potent explanatory variables be-
yond the aggregate and segregate measures of CSR
and the relations between the explanatory variables
and the criterion were not linearly robust.

Discussion

Analyzing the data from 150 Indian companies, the
study examines the inﬂuence of CSR on ﬁnancial
and non-ﬁnancial ﬁrm performance. CSR was
assessed with respect to six primary stakeholders as
well as with respect to the aggregation of all stake-
holders. Results show that ﬁrms that are listed in
stock exchanges have better CSR and FP, but nei-
ther the ownership pattern nor ﬁrm size has inﬂu-
enced CSR, FP,
and NFP. Controlling the
confounding effects of stock-listing status, ownership
pattern, and ﬁrm size, an increase in the aggregate
measure of CSR has increased the FP and NFP of
ﬁrms. Also, more favorable CSR towards each of the
stakeholders has increased ﬁrm performance.

Stock-listing, ownership, ﬁrm size, and CSR

A favorable inﬂuence of stock-listing status on CSR
establishes that listed ﬁrms whose performance is

monitored regularly by multiple stakeholders display
a higher level of CSR compared to the non-listed
ﬁrms. Due to such monitoring and exposure to
multiple stakeholders, listed ﬁrms perform ﬁnancially
better than the non-listed ones. Performance of the
listed ﬁrms is shown in the balance sheets through the
measures of FP. Hence, stock-listing inﬂuences FP of
ﬁrms. However, it does not inﬂuence NFP which is a
subjective measure and is not captured in balance
sheets for evaluation by multiple stakeholders. Lack
of inﬂuence of ownership and ﬁrm size on CSR and
ﬁrm performance establishes that there is no differ-
ence between the SOEs and private sector companies
in India with respect to the level of CSR displayed by
them. Private sector companies such as Tata Steel and
Apollo Tyres are as responsible as the SOEs such as
Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited and Gas Authority of
India Limited. Furthermore,
larger ﬁrms do not
always display a high level of CSR compared to the
smaller ﬁrms (Wu, 2006). Smaller ﬁrms like Orissa
Milk Federation are as sensitive to stakeholders as
larger ﬁrms in the same category like AMUL.

Aggregate CSR and ﬁrm performance

An increase in the aggregate CSR boosts ﬁrm per-
formance. CSR-related beneﬁts may arise due to
two reasons. First, the CSR-induced revenue can
increase from enhanced sales and prices/margins.
Second, the CSR-induced cost decrease can result
from tax concessions, reductions of duties by the
government to promote CSR activities, efﬁciency
gains from environment-friendly technologies, and
reduced cost of capital. A stakeholder-oriented ﬁrm
while generating value for
stakeholders also
generates value for its
shareholders. A favorable
aggregate CSR towards all the primary stakeholders
creates a ﬂeet of satisﬁed stakeholders who bring in
efﬁciency gains and cost advantages through various
means that ultimately improve ﬁrm performance.
Satisﬁed employees reward the ﬁrm through pro-
ductivity gains and reduced hiring and training costs,
satisﬁed customers improve product sales through
repeat purchase behavior,
satisﬁed investors lend
more capital at a cheaper rate decreasing cost of

its

satisﬁed communities

capital,
reduce the public
relations cost, environmental stewardship leads to
reputational advantages, and better suppliers reduce
quality certiﬁcation costs. Findings establish that
effective management of key stakeholders improves
FP (Berman et al., 1999; Waddock and Graves,
1997). By being responsive to stakeholders, a ﬁrm
also ensures superior performance compared to its
competitors (Turban and Greening, 1997). When
ﬁrms enhance CSR towards
stakeholders,
consumers not only like, respect, or admire the ﬁrms
but also identify with it. Such identiﬁcation becomes
so strong and enduring (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001)
that consumers become brand ambassadors of the
ﬁrms
(Springer, 2006) with long-lasting loyalty
(Gillentine, 2006).

their

CSR towards employees and ﬁrm performance

Past research establishes the importance of primary
stakeholders as value drivers of a ﬁrm’s performance


588

Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar

(Barney and Hansen, 1994; Clarkson, 1995; Fom-
burn and Shanley, 1990). A direct link between
CSR towards employees and ﬁrm performance
substantiates previous ﬁndings (Berman et al., 1999).
Higher CSR towards employees
in terms of
employee-sensitive policies and practices by ﬁrms en-
hances employee productivity, reduces absenteeism,
and facilitates recruitment and retention of better
quality employees
(Turban and Greening, 1997).
Attention on progressive human resource manage-
ment practices, including training and development of
employees, their participation in problem solving,
progressive remuneration policies, and grievance
handling reduces the attrition rate, increases employee
productivity and FP (Huselid, 1995; Youndt et al.,
1996). Lower attrition rates lead to lesser personnel
hiring costs that ultimately improve ﬁrm performance.
Corroborating past ﬁndings (Leff, 2004), the study
ﬁnds that concern for employees is a part of core
activities of Indian companies that improves ﬁrm
performance.
Indian companies have successfully
integrated various CSR issues related to employees
such as workplace safety and beneﬁt plans into the
companies’ functions that ultimately reward them by
enhancing their proﬁtability and competitive position.
Better corporate consciousness on these issues and
positive inﬂuence of CSR towards employees on ﬁrm
performance may be attributed to the presence of
empowered trade unions and strong labor laws in
India, particularly in case of manufacturing companies.

CSR towards customers and ﬁrm performance

A favorable CSR towards customers enhances ﬁrm
proﬁtability and NFP. This is congruent with previ-
ous ﬁndings
that ﬁrms gain by adding socially
responsible elements to products (Berman et al., 1999;
Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Davidson and Worell,
1988). Ceteris paribus, customers are more likely to
buy from companies that engage in CSR activities
that they ﬁnd appropriate and personally relevant
(Brown and Dacin, 1997; Sen et al., 2006). Cus-
tomers reward companies that produce reliable and
better quality products, and adhere to safety standards
which improve FP (Berman et al., 1999; Graaﬂand
and van de Ven, 2006). Company policies and prac-
tices towards issues such as ethical advertising and
pricing or providing products to the economic dis-

advantaged induce a ‘feel good factor’ among the
customers. They feel happy and proud to be identiﬁed
with such companies. Such identiﬁcation (Sen and
Bhattacharya, 2001) elicits repeat purchase behavior
and ushers in competitive advantage for the ﬁrm.
Alternatively, customers boycott companies who
mislead them. An independent survey by GMI Poll
(2005) ﬁnds that Nestle´ is one of the most widely
boycotted companies in the world for its unethical
promotion of baby foods and infant formulas. Com-
panies such as Nestle´ India, Johnson and Johnson, and
Wockhardt that sell baby foods are being prosecuted
in India for giving misleading and scientiﬁcally
feeding in their
incorrect
advertisements and promotion materials
(Gupta,
2005). Boycotting of a company’s products and agi-
tations and legal actions against the company jeopar-
dize its image and adversely affect ﬁrm performance
(Berman et al., 1999; Financial Express, 2006).

information on infant

CSR towards investors and ﬁrm performance

Past research has established that better governance
standards of companies lead to enhanced proﬁtability
(Black and Khanna, 2007; Business Week, 2002).
Better corporate governance practices by ﬁrms have
favorable impact on FP indicators such as economic
value added and market value added (Coles et al.,
2001). Commitment of the management towards
strong controls emphasizing ethical and social respon-
sible behavior
improves proﬁtability (Verschoor,
1998) and acts as a source of competitive advantage
for ﬁrms. Stakeholders have increased conﬁdence on
such ﬁrms. Investors pay a premium to buy the stocks
of well-governed ﬁrms
(Coombes and Watson,
2000). They even become willing to provide further
capital to such ﬁrms at a lower rate of interest which
reduces the cost of capital. Such factors enhance ﬁrm
value and performance. Indian companies have to
comply with various mandatory governance stan-
dards laid down in the Clause 49 of the Listing
Agreements, 2005 which is implemented by SEBI.
Companies that fail to comply with the standards

standards has motivated many other Indian ﬁrms to
display similar practices and reap beneﬁts of good
governance (CLSA, 2000).

CSR towards community and ﬁrm performance

Qualitative research on CSR using case studies
establishes a favorable relation between community
initiatives of ﬁrms and improved ﬁrm performance
(Brugmann and Prahalad, 2007; Rockefeller, 2003)
though empirical research (Berman et al., 1999) does
not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relation between the two
constructs. Findings of this study corroborate the
ﬁndings of the qualitative research. A recent survey
on business–community relations in India shows that
85% of the surveyed ﬁrms agree that they have a
responsibility to the surrounding community and are
committed towards their cause (Mahajan, 2004). A
socially responsible image of companies among the
local community improves the brand and loyalty of
consumers. Consumers reward good corporate citi-
zens through greater and sustained patronage (Luo
and Bhattacharya, 2006). Positive CSR of compa-
nies enhances overall product evaluation by con-
sumers (Brown and Dacin, 1997). Consumers pay
attention to the CSR records of the companies,
encompassing mainly their community initiatives,
while purchasing (Gildea, 1994; Owen and Scherer,
1993). Good corporate citizens can also reduce costs
through indirect beneﬁts such as tax advantages,
improved quality of local labor, and fewer lawsuits
from employees and environmentalists
(Ullman,
1985; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Section 80G of
the Income Tax Act in India grants tax beneﬁts to
Indian companies that invest on community devel-
opment projects. Investment
in such projects in
association with the local government and NGOs
improves
image while reducing its
expenses on tax payments. The ﬁrm faces less resis-
tance from the local community and the govern-
ment while pursuing its activities. The Tata group,
which is well known as the most respected corporate
citizen in India, provides the cheapest car in the
world to the burgeoning cash-starving middle-
income Indian families through its ‘Nano’ project.
This project has received support from local gov-
ernments and community in many Indian states due
to the company’s reputation of corporate citizenship.

A favorable CSR towards environment increasing
FP and NFP of ﬁrms supports past ﬁndings (Ahmed
et al., 1998; Alvarez et al., 2001). Environmentally
compatible products, processes and management
systems enhance proﬁtability either through revenue
gains or through cost savings. Revenues increase
as consumers prefer products of environmen-

Rosewicz, 1990).
in environmental
reduces costs arising from
management
environmental crisis, wastages of
raw materials,
and inefﬁcient production processes (Allen, 1992;
Schmidheiny, 1992). Market values of ﬁrms signif-
icantly increase when they adopt environmentally
proactive stands or receive environmental awards
(Klassen and Mc Laughlin, 1996). Adoption of
superior environmental standards not only prepares
ﬁrms to handle stricter regulations in the future but
also positions them ahead of competitors (Barrett,
1992). Mainly four factors can be attributed to
the environmental proactivity of Indian companies.
First, there is a separate ministry under the Indian
government, the ministry of environment and for-
est, which monitors and enforces environmental
quality standards through pollution control boards.
Companies are required to adhere to mandatory
standards speciﬁed in over 180 enactments related to
environmental and industrial pollution such as the
Forest (Conservation) Act, 1981, the Air (Preven-
tion and Control of Pollution) Act, 1986, and the
Environment (Prevention) Act, 1986. Second, since
1994, environmental management plans have been
made mandatory for setting up new business units,
and expansion or modernization of existing units.
Third, past industrial disasters like the ‘Bhopal Gas
tragedy’
in 1984 have raised environmental con-
sciousness of Indian companies. Fourth, adoption of
voluntary environmental standards has become a
prerequisite to compete in the global market. Such
factors have prompted Indian companies to include
environmental management practices as a part of
their core activities (Leff, 2004). Among the 150
studied ﬁrms, 92% have clearance from pollution
control boards, which is mandatory. In addition,
43% have adopted ISO 14000 and 15% have
adopted OHSAS 18000. Such proactivity enhances
ﬁrm performance.

CSR towards suppliers and ﬁrm performance

The demand for social audit by international buyers
and multi-national business associates from devel-
oped countries has made it necessary for companies
in emerging markets like India to ensure responsible
and ethical practices at
locations. By
ensuring ethical practices at
locations,
companies increase their competitiveness and image
in the global market that improves ﬁrm performance.
The ﬁndings of the study concur that favorable CSR
towards suppliers can be a deﬁnite source of com-
petitive advantage and bring higher returns.

Limitations

Issues

There are certain limitations of the study that must
be acknowledged. First, the data on CSR and NFP
are perceptual in nature. Respondents might have
overemphasized the positive aspects of CSR as well
as NFP of their ﬁrms and understated corresponding
negative aspects. Notwithstanding the limitations,
a priori model is assumed for the items measuring
each construct of CSR and ascertained applying
CFA that arrests the common method variance sta-
tistically. Moreover, because the data on FP and
sources,
CSR are collected from two different
common method variance in the results
is also
arrested procedurally (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Sec-
ond, the data are collected from 18 categories of
industries.
faced by each category being
unique and different from one another, an aggregate
analysis across multiple categories of industries might
have missed industry-speciﬁc issues
(Grifﬁn and
Mahon, 1997). However, CSR issues included in
the study are generic in nature. For example,
product quality and price, safety standards in the
work place, community partnership, or stronger
governance standards represent responsible business
practices across industries. Third, the proposed CSR
measure may be a narrow conceptualization of CSR
as it assesses a ﬁrm’s social policies and practices
towards primary stakeholders. The measure can be
strengthened by incorporating actionable outcomes.
For example, items like policies and practices to-
wards ‘training and development of women and
minorities’ or ‘sexual harassment prohibition’ can be
matched with corresponding actionable outcomes

about the actual number of training programs pro-
vided to women and minorities or the redressal of
actual number of sexual harassment cases. Lastly,
because data are collected from only 18 categories of
manufacturing industries in India, caution must be
exercised in generalizing the ﬁndings.

Implications and future research direction

research adds a ‘stakeholder-sense’

Corporate social responsibility (policy, program, or
process) is ‘strategic’ when it yields substantial busi-
ness-related beneﬁts to the ﬁrm (Burke and Logsdon,
1996). This approach towards CSR has been criti-
cized by researchers for a lack of intrinsic and moral
grounding (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Vogel, 2005).
They argue that such an approach reduces CSR to a
marketing instrument (Maignan and Ferrell, 2001)
and turns stakeholders as ‘means’ to the ‘ends’ of
maximizing shareholder wealth (Goodpaster, 1998).
This
to the
‘business-sense’ of CSR. By designing stakeholder-
sensitive policies, ﬁrms cater to a wide range of issues
relevant to stakeholders. Many issues included in the
proposed CSR framework do not have a direct link
with proﬁtability. For example, indicators such as
ethical advertising, diversity, policies towards insider
trading, or policies to eliminate human rights’ abuses
at the work place and supplier locations do not have
any direct ﬁnancial implications. Rather these factors
bring ethical issues into the CSR discussion. In this
sense, this study addresses the concern about lack of
ethical dimensions in CSR research. By bringing
stakeholder-sensitive and ethical issues into the CSR
framework, it advocates such an approach can be
beneﬁcial for both the ﬁrm and its stakeholders, and
lead to a win-win situation for both.

This study contributes to the empirical literature
of CSR in three ways. First, when the study was
carried out in 2005, no systematic database on CSR
was available for evaluating Indian companies from
the stakeholders’ perspective. Though there are few
recent attempts to rate CSR activities of Indian
companies, like the Karmayog CSR rating (India-
PRwire.com, 2007), an objective assessment of CSR
like that done by KLD in the US is still not found in
India. We have developed and validated an instru-
ment to assess CSR from the stakeholders’ per-
spective in the Indian context that can be used in

future investigations. Second, past studies (Cochran
and Wood, 1984; Ruf et al., 2001; Waddock and
Graves, 1997) have used aggregate CSR measures
from secondary sources due to the availability of
such data. This study has considered a segregated
form of CSR in addition to the aggregated form in
the analysis by collecting primary data on individual
CSR dimensions of ﬁrms. A segregated analysis of
CSR points out critical issues embedded in speciﬁc
stakeholders and the inﬂuence of such issues on ﬁrm
performance, which cannot be captured by carrying
out an aggregated analysis alone. Capturing such
issues are important because, inﬂuenced by a higher
level of aggregate CSR, companies may overlook
speciﬁc stakeholder issues which might have critical
bearing on ﬁrm performance. Third,
few studies
have reported the positive impact of environmental
proactivity on NFP (Ahmed et al., 1998; Benito and
Benito, 2005) but not
in the context of other
stakeholders. This study reveals the direct inﬂuence
of CSR towards six primary stakeholder groups
including environment on NFP as well as on FP.
Convergence of results from the two analyses, one
using FP and the other using NFP, strengthens the
link (Bouchard, 1976) between CSR and ﬁrm per-
formance. Contrary to negative relationships found
in few past studies (Davidson and Worell, 1988;
Davidson et al., 1987), this study establishes positive
relationships between the aggregate and segregate
dimensions of CSR and ﬁrm performance. The
negative results of past studies are mostly attributed
to the use of volatile market-based measures such as
stock returns (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997). Because
this study has used a more consistent accounting
measure of ROA,
the results concur with past
positive evidences on CSR inﬂuencing ﬁrm per-
formance (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Grifﬁn and
Mahon, 1997; McGuire et al., 1988). Furthermore,
it is important to account for the contribution of
CSR towards the creation of intangible assets such as
corporate reputation and image which are reﬂected
in a ﬁrm’s NFP. This study reports CSR as a better
predictor of NFP compared to FP. The aggregate
and segregate dimensions of CSR are found to be
the more potent contributors to creation of intan-
gible assets such as employee satisfaction, customer
relationships, and internal business process efﬁ-
ciency, compared to the tangible ﬁnancial gains.

responsible business behaviors

During the survey, it was found that many Indian
executives had misconceptions about CSR. Many
companies initially declined to participate in the
survey on the ground that they did not have a CSR
department or did not undertake any CSR activity.
Like a recent survey which ﬁnds that CSR activities
of many Indian companies are mainly handled by
public relations or human resources department ra-
ther than a CSR department (Sagar and Singla,
2004), our survey also ﬁnds that 90% of the surveyed
companies have neither an exclusive department nor
a speciﬁc budget
for CSR. Moreover, surveyed
managers equated CSR with philanthropic activities
such as conducting health awareness programs,
plantation activities, and donating for charity or
socio-cultural activities. They participated in the
survey when it was explained that a proper assess-
ment of CSR goes beyond philanthropy and
includes
towards
though Indian
stakeholders. This
companies
adopt
sensitive policies
and practices, they are not aware that such activities
could be called CSR. This study can be an eye-
for broadening
opener
their understanding of CSR that
the
stakeholder map. Moreover, this study addresses the
concern of Indian businessmen who do not adopt a
long-term CSR policy due to its lack of provable
link with proﬁtability (British Council et al., 2002).
The present ﬁndings may translate into higher
number of Indian companies engaging in mean-
ingful CSR activities
emphasizing stakeholder
relations. The study is conducted in the manufac-
turing sector. Future study may be carried out for
speciﬁc industry categories even within the manu-
facturing industry such as automobile, chemical,
and the like to bring out industry speciﬁc issues.
Future research may also deal with CSR issues in
the service sector and the small and medium
enterprises which are growing at a faster rate in
India. This study has not considered the inﬂuence
of price on CSR strategy. Studying consumers’
reactions when CSR costs are added to the price of
a product can be a potential area of research in the
context of
the price sensitive Indian consumers.
Inﬂuence of Indian values and leadership style on
the managerial approach towards CSR can also be
investigated.
