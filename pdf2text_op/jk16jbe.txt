Abstract Using two ﬁrm-level datasets in Korea, we
analyzed the effects of corporate social responsibility
(CSR) on employment relations. We propose that par-
ticipation in corporate social activity may not necessarily
reﬂect an ethical commitment to do ‘‘the right thing,’’ but
instead can be associated with mobilizing internal re-
sources to offset the costs imposed by external CSR in-
volvement undertaken because of social pressure. Analysis
of the two datasets showed similar results. The results
demonstrate that socially responsible actions facilitate
employer tendency to use performance-based pay and ef-
ﬁciency-based work practices. We also ﬁnd that CSR has a
negative association with employment growth and in-
creased labor ﬂexibility through contingent employment.
These ﬁndings shed light on the internal impact of CSR
involvement on a ﬁrm’s employment policies with respect
to resource allocation.

increasingly compelled to acknowledge the demands of
corporate social responsibility (CSR). Although CSR ac-
tivities have greatly increased in recent years, conceptual
and empirical research on CSR during the last four decades
has mainly examined the relationship between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance (Cochran and Wood 1984; McWil-
liams and Siegel 2000; Pava and Krausz 1996; Waddock
and Graves 1997). As a result, research on CSR has been
criticized for ignoring the relationships between CSR and
other factors (Campbell 2007; Margolis and Walsh 2003).
One of these largely uninvestigated factors is the impact
of CSR on employment relations. The lack of empirical
research in this area, despite the importance of employees
as stakeholders in business organizations, is in sharp con-
trast to the recently escalating interest in the ethics of hu-
man resource management (Inyang et al. 2011; Guest and
Woodrow 2012).

Within the realm of the research that has been under-
taken on this topic,
two contrasting indications have
emerged concerning the association between CSR and
employees. From a social identiﬁcation perspective, a few
recent empirical studies have suggested that organizational
CSR improves employee job satisfaction (De Roeck et al.
2014), organizational commitment (Brammer et al. 2007),
and human resource retention (Jones 2010). On the other
hand, several qualitative studies have treated CSR as part
of a corporate propaganda strategy that can easily ignore
the interests of employees affected (Deakin and Hobbs
2007; Hillman and Keim 2001). Consequently, these em-
pirical inconsistencies have raised the need for a better
comprehension of the relationship between CSR and em-
ployment relations. In line with this thinking, Jamali and
Mirshak (2007) have suggested the need for quantitative
research on the effects of CSR on employment relations at
the ﬁrm-level. Nevertheless, empirical studies on the

impact of CSR on employment relations remain scarce
(Rodrigo and Arenas 2008).

The current paper, intended to ﬁll this research gap,
proposes an alternative framework for examining the re-
lationship between CSR and employment relations. From a
resource allocation viewpoint, this study analyzed the ef-
fect of CSR on various employment relations outcomes
such as performance-based wages, efﬁciency-based work
practices, employment growth, restructuring, and contin-
gent employment. Proposed hypotheses were tested using
two kinds of Korean ﬁrm-level datasets. This study ﬁrst
describes the institutional context: CSR in Korea. Theo-
retical perspective, hypotheses, analyses, and empirical
results follow. Finally, there is a discussion of ﬁndings,
conclusions, and implications.

Institutional Context: CSR in South Korea

Over the past few decades, Korean ﬁrms have drastically
revised their business strategy on CSR from traditionalism
to globalization. Engaging in CSR activity to improve a
ﬁrm’s reputation is now a popular business strategy (Kim
and Choi 2013). For instance, the total CSR expenditure of
the top 220 Korean ﬁrms has increased from USD 1.9
billion in 2008 to USD 2.5 billion in 2010 (Federation of
Korean Industries 2011). Moreover,
the Federation of
Korean Industries, an organization of employers, has re-
ported that a majority of the largest 500 Korean companies
have enacted a code of ethics (Federation of Korean In-
dustries 2011).

Managerial awareness of CSR in Korea stems largely
from changing business environments because of rapid
globalization. This trend has facilitated the rapid spread of
CSR in Korea. That is, Korean ﬁrms have become more
globalized since the early 1990s. For instance, foreign di-
rect
investment by Korean multinational corporations
(MNCs) increased from about USD 1068 million in 1990 to
over USD 25,590 million in 2011 (Korea Eximbank 2012).
This change has required Korean MNCs to adopt and ad-
here to global standards in response to social demands in
host countries. Thus, CSR undertaken by large Korean
ﬁrms has involved efforts to improve ethical business
practices such as management
improved
corporate governance, and integrity in accounting.

transparency,

Despite this increase in CSR activity, controversy exists
as to whether CSR can improve the interests of both in-
ternal and external stakeholders. Whereas corporate man-
agers argue that CSR in Korea has beneﬁted the well-being
of employees, others believe that these policies have been
instituted merely for public relations and largely ignore the
interests of employees (Choi et al. 2010). For instance, in a
study

demonstrated that their CSR programs focused on external
social issues rather than internal labor standards. We be-
lieve that the recent dramatic growth in CSR activities and
the debate on their impact on internal stakeholders render
the Korean case a suitable research setting for the present
study.

Theoretical Perspective and Hypotheses

Although academic debates over the last four decades have
reached no clear consensus, CSR can be roughly deﬁned as
follows: Being closely related to the social expectations of
corporations (Zenisek 1979), CSR involves multidimen-
sional decision-making beyond the economic interests of
the business (Carroll 1979, 1991) or legal requirements
(McWilliams and Siegel 2001). Since scholars have de-
ﬁned CSR in different ways, some researchers have at-
tached strategic implications to CSR without regard for its
alleged altruism. For example, Porter and Kramer (2006)
argued that corporate attention to CSR is not entirely vol-
untary but involves strategic decision-making. According
to their perspective, involvement in socially responsible
activity within competitive business environments is not
voluntary but a compelling strategic choice. This strategic
view stems from societal expectations that perceive CSR
involvement as a signal of corporate legitimacy. In the
same vein, managers want CSR to be directly linked to
performance (Zu and Song 2009), and CSR is certainly
related to managerial concerns about the bottom line.

CSR and Employment Relations from a Resource
Allocation Perspective

Resource is a paramount concern for managers attempting
to implement CSR programs. One can easily see the im-
portance of resource availability in pursuing CSR. Despite
the importance of resource availability in implementing
corporate responsibility programs,
there is a dearth of
scholarly attention in resource allocation decision in im-
plementing speciﬁc social responsibility programs. The
present paper tries to explain the effects of CSR programs
on employment relations by exploring its integration with
the conceptual framework of resource allocation decisions
within ﬁrms.

The burden of obtaining resources for participating in
CSR within a competitive business environment is always
a concern for management.
Indeed, Freeman (1984,
pp. 38–40) conﬁrmed the relationship between CSR and
available resources, as ‘‘CSR is often looked at as an ‘‘add
on’’ to ‘‘business as usual’’ and the phrase often heard from
executives is ‘‘CSR is ﬁne, if you can afford it.’’’’ Since
management has to consider both beneﬁts and additional

costs for CSR, the situation of ‘catch 22’ in the adoption of
CSR program frequently occurs (Jamali et al. 2009).

Needless to say, corporations need resources to respond
to recent global trends, such as the adoption of codes of
conduct and ISO26000. Some costs resulting from CSR
activities are not directly ﬁnancial (such as environmental
protection) but nonetheless frequently impose monetary
burdens such as investment in green technologies; others
are directly ﬁnancial, such as donations to charities and the
creation of scholarship funds (Aupperle et al. 1985). As
Campbell (2007) distinguished between lip service for CSR
and substantive activities requiring signiﬁcant internal re-
sources, socially responsible actions impose considerable
costs. Parkinson (2003) also noted that CSR is often con-
trolled by economic conditions rather than by managerial
choices. Therefore, maintaining a good reputation through
CSR in a competitive environment depends on a ﬁrm’s
resources to a certain degree.

A management committed to social issues is likely to
work toward mobilizing available resources. Firms in-
crease CSR involvement when they have adequate ﬁnan-
cial resources (Ullmann 1985; Waddock and Graves 1997).
If they do not have sufﬁcient resources for CSR initiative,
however, management must mobilize other resources for
maintaining CSR programs that satisfy social expectation.
In particular, because involvement in social activity for
external stakeholders results in higher social expenses than
noninvolvement, ﬁrms pay attention to effective and efﬁ-
cient use of resources. We used the logic of resource al-
location in formulating the theoretical framework and
hypotheses of our study.

Hypotheses

An important point here is that mobilizing resources in
response to social responsibilities may sometimes conﬂict
with the interests of employees. Although employees are
obviously one of the stakeholders and a few studies based
on a normative perspective have given attention to the
positive link between socially responsible actions and
outcomes of employment relations, questions are arising as
to the possibility of balancing the interests of all stake-
holders, given the limited resources (Sternberg 1997).

During the process of resource mobilization, for exam-
ple, ﬁrms can undertake cost cutting that may be detri-
mental to working conditions. If CSR is adopted as part of
a corporate propaganda strategy, the interests of employees
are more like to be ignored or sacriﬁced. Indeed, previous
studies have indicated that although ﬁrms were involved in
CSR activities, they often ignored their responsibilities to
their employees (Aupperle et al. 1985; Pava and Krausz
1996). Hillman and Keim (2001) asserted that employers
frequently regard CSR as an obligatory response to

external issues rather than as an obligation to their em-
ployees. Deakin and Hobbs (2007) also argued that em-
ployers tended to see CSR as concerned with external
social issues and unrelated to internal employment issues.
Similarly, IBM, the famous multinational company, has a
long reputation for its involvement in CSR, but was forced
to offer its employees early retirement, buyouts, and un-
desirable transfers in order to maintain organizational ef-
fectiveness (Cottrill 1990). Therefore, CSR itself may not
beneﬁt employees.

Wood (1991) highlighted the importance of a balanced
CSR activity based on three dimensions: individual choice
(e.g., managerial preferences), organizational responsibility
(e.g., ﬁrm-speciﬁc interests), and institutional necessity
(e.g., general obligations). However, qualitative research
has demonstrated that because of a lack of resources, bal-
anced CSR activities in all three dimensions are rarely
achievable and thus not adopted (Cooper and Owen 2007;
Cottrill 1990; Hillman and Keim 2001; Vogel 2006). In
many cases in which a choice must be made between ex-
ternal and internal demands, a ﬁrm must consider external
demands ﬁrst because of the inability, over concern for its
reputation and public image, to withdraw from social ac-
tivities. As a result, ﬁrms are increasingly directing their
CSR activities into external social issues, especially when
social demands are strong and the requisite internal re-
source is not available.

A business primarily has two options to mobilize its
resources. One is to improve its organizational efﬁciency.
The other is to reduce its internal costs. From a strategic
business perspective, the goal of mobilizing resources is to
generate resource reserves through both efﬁciency en-
hancement and cost minimization. Good examples of the
former include efforts to increase productivity by using
innovative work systems and/or undertaking practices to
enhance employee motivation. These practices are closely
associated with generating tangible and intangible re-
sources by using employee knowledge and creativity
through employee involvement programs and various in-
centives to motivate employees. Cost minimization is as-
sociated with reducing operating costs including labor
costs. It can involve adoption of more ﬂexible utilization of
human resources such as organizational restructuring and
the use of a contingent labor force. In general, a contingent
labor force is likely to be associated negatively with the
interests of employees.

In formulating our hypotheses, we ﬁrst considered the
methods that ﬁrms may adopt to improve organizational
efﬁciency to mobilize resources for CSR. The majority of
the literature mentioned that performance-based pay is one
popular way for organizations to enhance organizational
performance. Pay-for-performance is a monetary incentive
pay system in which employee compensation is related to

123


298

job performance. Performance-based pay includes indi-
vidual merit–pay, gainsharing, and proﬁt sharing. The
number of companies adopting pay-for-performance in
Korea has been steadily increasing since the late 1990s,
and over 50 % of all Korean companies were reported to
connect at least part of an employee’s pay to measures of
performance (Shin et al. 2014). Since monetary rewards are
the main incentive for increased productivity, quality, and
customer service, pay-for-performance is considered as a
powerful motivator in enhancing organizational perfor-
mance by motivating and reinforcing the rewarded
behavior.

Firms needing resources for CSR programs such ﬁnan-
cial donations have to improve short-term ﬁnancial per-
formance by adopting performance-enhancing programs.
We determine that corporations implementing CSR pro-
grams are likely to adopt pay-for-performance because it
motivates employees through material, i.e., monetary, in-
centives. This is why that the ﬁnancial performance of
ﬁrms with pay-for-performance is superior to that of ﬁrms
without it and previous empirical studies support this claim
(Abowd 1990; Delery and Doty 1996; Lee et al. 2011;
Origo 2009). For example, Origo (2009), using data from
Italian metalworking ﬁrms, found that performance-related
pay contributed to increases in productivity in the range of
7–11 %.

More speciﬁcally, prior literature has reported a sig-
niﬁcant relationship between CSR and incentive-based
compensation (Falck and Heblich 2007; Mahoney and
Thorne 2005). Also, Jones et al. (2007), in their case study
involving Australian companies, found that the extent to
which a ﬁrm is involved in CSR was directly correlated to
its adopting a performance-based wage system. Therefore,
we are safe in assuming that ﬁrms oriented to CSR in-
volvement are more likely to adopt performance-based pay
than ﬁrms without CSR involvement. Based on this rea-
soning and on previous empirical results, we formulated
the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1 The degree of involvement in CSR will be
positively related to the adoption of performance-based
pay.

We also believe that ﬁrms with CSR activities are more
likely to adopt efﬁciency-based work practices because
these ﬁrms seek to recoup social costs through improved
productivity and enhanced quality. Indeed, one way to re-
coup the costs incurred through socially responsible actions
is to increase internal efﬁciency through innovative work
practices that improve organizational performance. Previ-
ous studies have generally shown that efﬁciency-based
work practices such as self-autonomous teams, quality
circles and job rotations contributed positively to a ﬁrm’s
performance. These practices heightened employees

123

morale and satisfaction and increased motivation through
involvements and better communication that in turn leads
to heightened utilization of previously untapped knowledge
and creativity within the workforce (Ichniowski et al. 1996;
Neumark and Cappelli 1999). In a similar context, Paul and
Siegel (2006) argued that managers tend to implement in-
ternal efﬁciency practices along with CSR programs be-
cause they expect the beneﬁts of workplace innovation to
exceed the costs associated with socially responsible ac-
tivity. Vitaliano and Stella (2006), in their empirical study
using data from the banking industry, also found that ﬁrms
adopted practices aimed at maximizing internal efﬁciency
to offset the costs of socially responsible activity. Based on
the evidence from these studies, we hypothesized that ﬁrms
engaged in CSR are more likely to adopt efﬁciency-based
work practices than those without CSR.

Hypothesis 2 The degree of involvement in CSR will be
positively related to the degree of adaptation of efﬁciency-
based work practices.

Next, we also constructed hypotheses regarding how ﬁrms
pursuing CSR activities attempt to use various means to
minimize operating costs. CSR costs undertaken by a ﬁrm to
solidify its public reputation and image seem to facilitate
implementation of a labor cost minimization strategy. If
ﬁrms cannot reduce such external obligations as CSR, they
may instead implement a cost-cutting strategy to decrease
internal costs such as labor. In this context, prior case studies
have observed a tendency of management to separate re-
sponsibility to employees from strategic CSR for social is-
sues (Hillman and Keim 2001; Fenwick and Bierema 2008).
That is, when a ﬁrm cannot maintain CSR activities for both
internal and external stakeholders, management tends to
pursue CSR activities exclusively for external stakeholders.
The activities likely to be continued include environmental
protection, donations, and scholarships.

In the same vein, the current study predicts a negative
relationship between CSR activities and employment
growth. Although new employee recruitment is important
in terms of corporate social obligations to both employees
and society, businesses participating in CSR may be wary
of adding personnel because they must anticipate the ex-
pense involved in CSR activities as well as plan for any
unexpected future reduction in product demand. For man-
agement, a larger employment roster implies a consider-
able increase in short-term and long-term labor costs; these
costs include recruitment, selection, training, compensa-
tion, and safety and health. In many cases, management
regards labor as a quasi-ﬁxed cost. Indeed, several case
studies have shown either that CSR and employment are
unrelated (Deakin and Hobbs 2007), or
that CSR is
positively related to employee reduction in special situa-
tions (Benson 2008). Overall, we believe that ﬁrms

299

participating in CSR tend to have a more conservative
employment policy than others and are less likely to ex-
perience employment growth:

Hypothesis 3 The degree of involvement in CSR will be
negatively related to employment growth.

According to Zu and Song (2009), managers perceive
CSR as a ﬁnancial burden, and when they have to become
involved in CSR activities, they ﬁrst examine their ﬁnan-
cial situation. When a ﬁrm faces additional outlays for CSR
to avoid violating its societal obligations, it is likely to
concentrate on more proﬁtable practices that also improve
organizational efﬁciency through reductions in labor costs.
One way to reduce labor costs is to seek numerical ﬂex-
ibility, and organizational restructuring is one of the most
widely used practices to achieve this. In general, restruc-
turing has been regarded as a sure way to gain short-term
ﬁnancial savings when facing ﬁnancial constraints. Thus,
we opine that ﬁrms with CSR are more likely to restructure
as a means to cope with CSR expenses.

The previous literature supports our proposition. For
instance, Bonvin’s (2007) case study in Switzerland de-
scribed how a ﬁrm involved in CSR did not hesitate to lay
off employees when it was short of liquid assets. Vogel
(2006) also found that many global companies made social
contributions in developing countries at the expense of
their employees’ job security in the parent country. These
studies suggest that ﬁrms meeting external demands for
social activities may have to resort to organizational re-
structuring to minimize labor costs. This view highlights a
positive association between CSR and organizational re-
structuring in externally socially responsible ﬁrms. Pursuit
of this line of reasoning leads to the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 4 The degree of involvement in CSR will be
positively related to organizational restructuring.

Another means of securing labor ﬂexibility is the usage of
contingent workers. Although contingent employment ar-
rangements have been criticized for the insecurity and vul-
nerability for employees, use of nonstandard forms of
employment may convey explicit advantages to contempo-
rary corporations. This is because contingent employment
provides ﬁrms with labor ﬂexibility while typically lowering
labor costs. This labor arrangement confers ﬂexibility because
contingent workers can be more easily terminated than per-
manent employees, enabling rapid adjustment in labor to re-
spond to changes in business conditions. Labor costs are
typically lower in this arrangement because workers are paid
less. We expect that CSR participation relates positively to the
use of contingent employment. It is believed that ﬁrms un-
dertaking social commitments such as making contributions
and providing community services prefer workforce ﬂex-
ibility in which contingent employment
is seen as an

instrument to offset social costs. Indeed, previous case studies
have presented the possibility that conditions of resource
constraints juxtapose CSR involvement and contingent em-
ployment. Smith and Helfgott (2010) reported a case in which
top management in a ﬁrm promised CSR policies focusing on
community relations and environmental protection but con-
comitantly reclassiﬁed 70 % of its workforce from permanent
to temporary contracts. In particular, CSR involvement may
accelerate the usage of contingent employment in certain
geographic regions (such as in Asia and Latin America) where
legal protection of contingent employees is limited. In such
countries, the cost of social expenses can easily be transferred
to labor in the form of contingent employment. For these
reasons, we formulated the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 5 The degree of involvement in CSR will be
positively related to the use of contingent employment.

Taken together, we proposed the following theoretical
framework for the impact of CSR on employment relations
(see Fig. 1).

Research Methods

In the present paper, we utilized two different datasets to
construct a comprehensive picture on the effects of CSR on
employment relations. While Study 1 included only listed
ﬁrms that were relatively large and have well-developed
CSR programs, Study 2 included a representative sample of
all ﬁrms with more than 30 employees in Korea. By
analyzing two different datasets, the results can be ex-
pected to be less biased and have greater generalizability. If
different datasets provide consistent results, the resultant
ﬁndings can expect greater credibility.

Economic Justice Institute (KEJI). Established in 1990,
KEJI is one of the leading nongovernmental organizations
in Korea. KEJI has evaluated the CSR activities of publicly
listed ﬁrms annually since 1991, and each company is rated
on multiple attributes deemed relevant to CSR. The KEJI
index covers about 350 publicly listed Korean companies
and annually discloses the scores of Korea’s top 200 ﬁrms
in terms of CSR. The KEJI index excludes banks, mutual
fund companies, and real estate investment ﬁrms because
these ﬁrms have very different ﬁnancial and accounting
systems and business environments from other ﬁrms such
as those in manufacturing, transportation, and construction.
Data for 5 years (2005–2009) on the ﬁrms comprising the
KEJI Index made up the dataset analyzed in this study.
This study examined 251 ﬁrms that were listed in the top
200 at least twice during the 5-year period. After excluding
17 ﬁrms that had gone out of business or merged during the
study period, 234 ﬁrms remained in our ﬁnal sample.

CSR evaluation using the KEJI index has a special ad-
vantage. This dataset has CSR performance ratings since
1991 and thus a depth of data useful for longitudinal ana-
lysis to investigate CSR trends. Indeed, the KEJI index was
the ﬁrst comprehensive, multidimensional CSR rating de-
veloped in Korea. It is comparable to the index of the
Council on Economic Priorities in the U.S., the Corporate
Responsibility Index in Australia, and the Asahi Founda-
tion Index of Japan (Choi et al. 2010). The KEJI index is
also similar to the index of Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini
(KLD), which has rated the ﬁrms of the S&P 500 (ﬁrms)
index on seven CSR categories since 1991.

Measurement

The present study collected data from four sources: the
KEJI index, telephone survey, business reports of ﬁrms,
and archival data from the Ministry of Labor and Em-
ployment in Korea. First, the KEJI index evaluates seven
qualitative areas (i.e., corporate governance, corporate
justice, economic contribution, community relations, cus-
tomer satisfaction, employee relations, and environmental
protection) based on 38 CSR items. The KEJI index is
based on publicly available data of the stock market and
other sources such as business reports. The KEJI index
used a modiﬁed version of items taken from studies by
Graves and Waddock (1994).

CSR activity was measured through the eight items of
the KEJI index listed below. These items can be classiﬁed
into three categories: community service, environmental
protection, and customer satisfaction related to social is-
sues. These eight items are as follows: amount of charitable
donations (this item belongs to community relations); en-
ergy efﬁciency in the workplace, environmental violations,
public disclosure of environmental violations, and rewards

123

related to environmental protection (these four items be-
long to environmental protection); and, lastly, certiﬁcates
of service, certiﬁcates of quality, and reductions in the
growth of advertising (these three items belong to customer
satisfaction). Each of the eight items was rated with stan-
dardized values calculated from the original scores.1 Two
categories of values, 0–2 and 0–3, were used for these eight
items. The scale from 0 to 2 was used for energy efﬁciency,
public disclosures about environmental violations, certiﬁ-
cates of service, and reductions in the growth of advertis-
ing. The scale from 0 to 3 was applied to amount of
charitable donations, rewards related to environmental
protection, environmental violations, and certiﬁcates of
quality. Therefore, the total possible score of CSR as the
sum of the above eight items ranged from 0 to 20.

Second, we conducted a telephone survey to collect data
for dependent variables such as performance-based pay,
efﬁciency-based work practices, and contingent employ-
ment. Human resources managers in the 234 ﬁrms were
surveyed in this way. We collected data for the past 5 years
(2005–2009) because ﬁrms usually had HR records for this
period. The telephone survey was conducted between April
1, 2011, and October 1, 2011. Completed questionnaires
were collected from 166 ﬁrms (response rate: 70.94 %)
after several
follow-ups. The 166 ﬁrms included 88
unionized and 78 nonunion organizations. The perfor-
mance-based pay variable was measured by the existence
of an individual merit–pay system, gainsharing, or proﬁt
sharing program, as used in the study by Brown (1990). If a
ﬁrm had an individual merit–pay system, it was coded as 1
(otherwise 0). If a ﬁrm had a gainsharing or proﬁt sharing
program, it was coded as 1 (otherwise 0). The perfor-
mance-based pay variable was calculated by the sum of the
two variables above, ranging from 0 to 2. Efﬁciency-based
work practices were obtained from HR managers and were
measured by three items used by Osterman (1994). The
three items are: team, QC activity, and job rotation. Re-
sponses were rated from 0 (nonexistent) to 1 (existent). All
three items were summed, and the variable, efﬁciency-
based work practices, was rated on a scale of 0–3. The
contingent employment variable was calculated as a per-
centage of the sum of part-time and ﬁxed-term employees

1 All items of the KEJI index were standardized by the following
process: First, a standardized value was created by two methods. One
is linear interpolation, which is a method of curve ﬁtting using linear
polynomials fy¼ ymin þðymax   yminÞðx  xminÞ=ðxmax   xminÞg : The
second is a method using interval scales (i.e., A, B, C, D, and E). Both
methods are dependent on characteristics of the original data. For
example, the interpolation standardization is used when the original
data have few missing values and have a standard normal distribution.
On the other hand, standardization using the interval scale is applied
when the original data have many missing values and their
distribution is skewed. Second, ﬁnal values are obtained by calcu-
lating the weighted rate of each item.

per the total number of employees. These data were also
drawn from the responses of HR managers.

Third, the business reports of the sample ﬁrms were
sources of data for several variables. Employment growth
was obtained from the business reports and calculated as
the total number of employees in the previous year divided
by the present number of employees. Organizational re-
structuring was measured by dichotomous categories used
by Ahmadjian and Robinson (2001), who deﬁned restruc-
turing as a decrease in the number of permanent employees
by more than 5 % from the previous year (between year
t - 1 and year t). Organizational restructuring was mea-
sured by whether employee numbers declined by more than
5 % from one year to the next (coded 1 if true, 0 if not)
(between 2004 and 2005, 2005 and 2006, 2006 and 2007,
2007 and 2008, and 2008 and 2009, respectively).

Control variables, which may have accounted for some
variations in the dependent variables at the ﬁrm level, were
also collected from business reports. We controlled for
ﬁrm-speciﬁc characteristics (i.e., ﬁrm size, ratio of pro-
duction/operation workers and unionization, if any) that
may inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s employment relations policies and
strategies (Evans 1987). Firm size was measured as the
natural log of the number of total employees. The ratio of
production/operation workers was measured as a percent-
age of the number of production/operation workers divided
by the total number of employees. The degree of foreign
ownership was controlled to reﬂect the corporate gover-
nance structure because foreign ownership exerts a con-
siderable impact on employment
(Slaughter
2007). Foreign ownership was measured as a percentage of
the number of foreign-owned stock divided by the total
amount of stock. Financial variables such as sales growth
and labor costs per worker were controlled because overall
ﬁnancial performance plays a role in shaping employment
relations policies and strategies (Huselid 1995). The sales
growth variable was calculated as the percentage growth in
sales in a given year compared with the preceding year.
Also, labor costs per worker were measured by dividing the
amount of total wages by the number of total workers.

relations

Finally, data related to labor unions were provided by
the Ministry of Labor and Employment in Korea. The
union variable was measured as a dummy variable and
coded as ‘‘nonexistent’’ (coded 0) or ‘‘existent’’ (coded 1).

Analyses

We used STATA (13.0 version) for unbalanced panel data
analysis. In general, a longitudinal data analysis provides
several advantages (Baltagi 2008). First, pooling multiple
observations for each ﬁrm increases both sample size and
degrees of freedom. Further, temporal effects that are not
detectable in a cross-sectional analysis can be controlled.

More importantly,
the panel data enable us to reduce
multicollinearity in linear regression analyses. The selec-
tion of the appropriate model in panel data analysis is
important to ensure correct estimation, because the ﬁxed
and random effects models represent different assumptions
about data. In general, if researchers analyze a population
that has heterogeneity within entities,
the ﬁxed effect
model is considered appropriate, whereas they analyze the
randomly chosen or stratiﬁed sample, the random effect
model is regarded suitable (Behrman and Wolfe 1989).
Since the present analyses dealt with the population of
ﬁrms with socially beneﬁcial CSR activities, ﬁxed effect
models were considered more appropriate (Borenstein et al.
2011). Fixed effects regressions were used to test Hy-
potheses 1, 2, 3, and 5. For Hypothesis 4, a logistics re-
gression model was used because the dependent variable,
organizational restructuring, was a 0–1 nominal variable.
In all models, control variables were included because of
their possible inﬂuence on employment and HRM
practices.

Results

Descriptive statistics and correlations for all variables are
presented in Table 1.

All hypotheses were empirically supported. Table 2
presented the relationships between CSR and dependent
variables. First,
the regression coefﬁcient of the CSR
variable on performance-based pay was positive and sig-
niﬁcant (b = .02, p \ .01, R2 = .11). Also, CSR has a
positive and signiﬁcant relation with efﬁciency-based work
practices (b = .02, p \ .05, R2 = .06). Thus, Hypotheses 1
and 2 were supported. Overall, these results indicated that
ﬁrms participating in socially responsible activities may
enhance internal efﬁciency through various HRM prac-
tices. In addition, three CSR index categories (i.e., com-
munity relations, customer satisfaction, and environmental
protection) on dependent variables were individually esti-
mated. In general, the individual estimations showed weak,
but hypothesized relationships between independent de-
pendent variables. While community service has signiﬁcant
and anticipated relationships with both performance-based
pay and efﬁciency-based work practices, customer satis-
faction activities were not signiﬁcantly related with HR
policies for organizational efﬁciency. Environmental pro-
tection showed a signiﬁcant and positive relationship only
with performance-based pay. Taken together, the results
tend to show that the more ﬁrms participated in external
CSR activities, the more they relied on strategies that en-
hanced internal efﬁciency.

Second, we tested the effects of CSR on employment
growth, organizational restructuring, and the usage of
contingent employment. The relationship between CSR

Good Neighbors but Bad Employers

and employee growth was revealed to be both negative and
signiﬁcant (b = -.72, p \ .05, R2 = .29), indicating that
ﬁrms engaged in CSR tended to hesitate in hiring new
employees, possibly because of the ﬁnancial constraints
imposed by the commitment to CSR. Regarding the rela-
tionship between CSR and organizational restructuring, the
result of logistic regressions exhibited a positive and sig-
niﬁcant association (b = .29, p \ .10, -2LL = 163.38)
between CSR and organizational restructuring. This ﬁnding
implies that ﬁrms rated higher for CSR engaged more ac-
tively in restructuring than ﬁrms with lower CSR scores.
This ﬁnding is consistent conceptually with the negative
relationship of CSR with employment growth. Taken to-
gether, these results indicate that CSR based on external
social issues may negatively inﬂuence employment growth
and employment security. Finally, the impact of CSR on
contingent employment likewise exhibited a positive and
relationship (b = 1.69, p \ .05, R2 = .08),
signiﬁcant
suggesting that ﬁrms with CSR are more likely to use
contingent workers than ﬁrms without CSR. Overall, these
ﬁndings suggest that ﬁrms involved in CSR tend to rely on
labor ﬂexibility to offset social costs.

restructuring. Also, CSR initiative

Again, we separately investigated the effects of each
category of CSR on employment relations. CSR initiative
for customer satisfaction showed signiﬁcant and an-
ticipated relationships with employment growth and orga-
nizational
for
community relations also showed signiﬁcant and an-
ticipated positive relationships with contingent employ-
ment. In other regression equations, regression coefﬁcients
generally showed expected, but insigniﬁcant, signs. Over-
all, the results tend to indicate that the more the ﬁrms
participated in external CSR activities, the more they im-
plemented strategies to minimize labor costs.

Despite the above ﬁndings, there can be concerns over
the generalizability of this sample. The present study con-
strained the sample to ﬁrms which had robust CSR pro-
grams according to the KEJI index. By limiting the sample
to only those ﬁrms which had appeared in the top 200 list at
least twice, the sampling methods produced a biased sample
with regard to CSR performance. The low standard de-
viation of CSR relative to its mean revealed this tendency.
Although one can assert that this renders the ﬁnding of the
association between CSR and employment relations out-
comes even more impressive statistically since the present
analysis dealt with such little variation in the variable, we
have to acknowledge the problem of generalizability.

Study 2

To remedy the generalizability problem of Study 1, we
conducted Study 2 utilizing a presumably less biased
dataset with very different measures of CSR.

Sampling

In Study 2, we examined the effects of CSR on the same
dependent variables using longitudinal data drawn from the
Korean Workplace Panel Survey (KWPS). This survey was
conducted by the Korea Labor Institute (KLI), a govern-
ment-funded labor research group. The WPS dataset in-
cludes workplaces selected by stratiﬁed sampling of all
establishments with more than 30 employees. The KWPS
was administered at 290 public enterprises and 1615 pri-
vate ﬁrms. Thus, the collected data are regarded to be na-
tionally representative sample of Korean ﬁrms. A survey
has been conducted biennially since 2005 in over 1905
workplaces and completed through face-to-face interviews
with HR managers, IR managers, and employee represen-
tatives or union leaders. Speciﬁcally, HR managers re-
sponded to questions about CSR activities and HR
practices such as performance-based pay and efﬁciency-
based work practices, and contingent employment.

In the current analysis, we used datasets from 2007, 2009,
and 2011. Although the KWPS has been conducted four times
since 2005, questions about CSR activities were begun in
2007. Thus, we use the data except for 2005. On the other
hand, we excluded ﬁrms with multiple workplaces because
some information, including ﬁnancial data (e.g., labor costs) is
difﬁcult to infer in ﬁrms with multiple workplaces. Our ana-
lysis therefore includes only ﬁrms that have a single work-
place. Finally, we excluded public (i.e., state-owned)
enterprises from our analysis because public enterprises pri-
marily pursue public interests rather than organizational efﬁ-
ciency, and this theoretical framework is inapplicable to public
enterprises. Notably, CSR involvements in public enterprises
can be undertaken to comply with government regulations
rather than a ﬁrm’s proﬁt-maximizing voluntary decision.

Measures

In Study 2, the measure of CSR, performance-based pay,
efﬁciency-based work practices, and contingent employ-
ment were collected from the KWPS dataset. Performance-
based pay, efﬁciency-based work practices, restructuring,
and contingent employment were measured by the same
measures as those used for Study 1. All other control
variables were also obtained from the same data sources as
those of Study 1. In addition, we controlled for 10 industry
dummy variables (i.e., manufacturing, education,
trans-
portation, service, construction, bank, retail, publication,
broadcasting, and engineering industries). Unlike the KEJI
index in Study 1, the KWPS data provide solutions to three
institutional questions to measure CSR involvement: (1)
whether a ﬁrm has mid- and long-term plans to conduct
CSR programs; (2) whether a ﬁrm has codes of conduct in
implementing CSR activities, and (3) whether a ﬁrm

operates an independent (stand-alone) department for CSR
programs. For example, respondents were asked the fol-
lowing question: ‘‘Does your company have mid- and
long-term plans for CSR actions?’’ All responses were
coded as 1 or 0. We summed responses for the three items
as a measure for CSR involvement. Factor analysis indi-
cated assignment of an Eigen value of 1.83 for a single
item comprised of CSR involvement and loadings, .87 for
plans for CSR, .88 for codes of conduct for CSR, and .89
for an independent department for CSR. Cronbach’s alpha
for all items was .84, which was acceptable for statistical
analyses. The measures of performance-based pay, efﬁ-
ciency-based work practices, and contingent employment
were identical in both Study 1 and Study 2.

Analyses

We used STATA (13.0 version) for unbalanced panel data
analysis. A random effects model was estimated in study 2.
Since the present analyses dealt with the stratiﬁed sample
of ﬁrms in Korean ﬁrms, random effect models were
deemed more appropriate (Borenstein et al. 2011).

Results

Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations for vari-
ables used in Study 2 are presented in Table 3.

All proposed hypotheses except for Hypothesis 4 were
empirically supported. The ﬁrst column of Table 4 presented
the relationships between CSR and performance-based pay.
The regression coefﬁcient of the CSR variable was both
positive and signiﬁcant (b = .08, p \ .05, R2 = .28). The
second column showed that CSR has both a positive and
signiﬁcant relation with efﬁciency-based work practices
(b = .25, p \ .01, R2 = .29). In the third column, the rela-
tionship between CSR and employee growth was shown to
have a negative and signiﬁcant association (b = -1.14,
p \ .10, R2 = .33). The fourth column indicates the rela-
tionship between CSR and organizational restructuring, and
the result of the logistic regressions revealed no signiﬁcant
association between CSR and organizational restructuring.
The ﬁfth column presents the impact of CSR on contingent
employment. The results again reveal a positive and sig-
niﬁcant relationship between CSR and the contingent em-
ployment variable (b = 1.02, p \ .05, R2 = .14). All of the
ﬁndings in Study 2 were consistent with those of Study 1
except for organizational restructuring.

Discussion and Conclusions

This paper used two Korean ﬁrm-level panel datasets to
test
the effects of CSR involvement on employment-

related issues. Major ﬁndings include CSR involvement (1)
facilitates employer tendency to use performance-based
pay and efﬁciency-based work practices, (2) has a negative
association with employment growth, and (3) showed a
positive relationship with increased labor ﬂexibility
through restructuring and/or contingent employment.

The present quantitative ﬁndings support the results of
previous qualitative studies. Royle’s (2005) case study
found a positive correlation between CSR and perfor-
mance-oriented payment systems, and Vitaliano and Stella
(2006) identiﬁed a positive relationship between CSR in-
volvement and efﬁciency-based work practices. The posi-
tive association between CSR and labor ﬂexibility was
manifested in several qualitative studies (Benson 2008;
Bonvin 2007; Smith and Helfgott 2010). However, while
previous studies analyzing CSR and employment relations
relied largely on a small set of cases, the present study
enhances the generalizability of these earlier studies. This
enhancement is owed to the adoption of multivariate panel
analyses that used two relatively large datasets each cov-
ering a 5-year period.

The results of this study accordingly have theoretical
implications. First, our ﬁndings support the argument that

as institutional pressures mount for explicit CSR behavior
such as charitable donations, ﬁrms tend to introduce CSR
activities as window dressing (Matten and Moon 2008). As
Freeman (1994) stated, these ﬁrms seem to suffer from the
‘‘separation thesis’’ or ‘‘separation fallacy’’ that there is
disconnect between business and ethics, or in this case
‘‘doing well’’ and ‘‘doing good.’’ These ﬁndings imply that
participation in corporate social activities may not neces-
sarily represent a commitment to do the right thing, but
instead can be associated with mobilizing internal re-
sources in response to the costs of CSR actions undertaken
because of institutional pressure.

Some have argued that CSR activities can lead to co-
operative labor-management relations, improve organiza-
tional identity, and commitment (Bhattacharya et al. 2008;
Brammer et al. 2007; Deakin and Whittaker 2007; Jones
2010; Turker 2009). The empirical ﬁndings of the present
study, however, seem to stand in contrast to this argument.
In reality, CSR commitment to social issues seems to im-
pose additional costs, and in response, ﬁrms with limited
resources appear to mobilize resources even by under-
mining the interests of internal stakeholders. Apparently,
the view arguing the positive impacts of CSR on

123

employment relations, which overlooks the role of limited
resources in terms of CSR involvement, can lead to
assertions that
tend to be too positivistic and rather
unrealistic.

to improvements

Second, the present study clearly emphasizes the im-
portance of enterprise resources available for allocation to
various competing demands. Our evidence indicates that
managerial options concerning CSR may be restricted in
the face of insufﬁcient resources. Management appears to
resort
efﬁciency and
minimization of labor costs as ways to marshal resources to
offset costs associated with externally oriented CSR ac-
tivities designed to both bolster a ﬁrm’s reputation and
secure its social legitimacy. The present study suggests
that, when confronted with limited resources and compet-
ing demands, management is more likely to meet external
social demands than address demands for employment
security of internal stakeholders.

in internal

Third, the present study tends to suggest two contrasting
faces of CSR. At the same time management attempts to be
projected as ‘‘a good neighbor’’ by committing to socially
desirable behavior, it appears ‘‘a bad employer’’ by un-
dermining the employment security of its own employees.
The present study implied that external CSR activities and
internal CSR activities may have a substitutive (instead of
complementary) relationship. The present study suggests
why in many cases an employer’s commitment to social
issues does not go hand in hand with employee interests.
Similarly, it attempts to explain why external CSR activity
is often incompatible with internal CSR. Our ﬁndings im-
ply that although ﬁrms are pressured to undertake socially
responsible positions toward both internal stakeholders and
society as a whole, the real world of limited resources
makes this balance of CSR difﬁcult to achieve.

The results of the present study could be inconsistent
with the ﬁndings of the meta-analysis by Orlitzky et al.
(2003) that showed that good social performance and higher
ﬁnancial performance are broadly correlated. In this regard,
an interesting suggestion for future research might be to
examine the ﬁrms which show the opposite relationship
between CSR and employment practices to the one we ﬁnd
in our sample, and to see what these ﬁrms do to maintain
good employment practices, while also implementing ex-
ternal facing CSR programs. That is, researchers need to
look at some individual cases where ﬁrms get these vari-
ables to move positively together. It will be useful to ﬁnd
out what programs these ﬁrms are implementing to meet
increased cost pressures for CSR programs.

This study has practical implications for policymakers
that policy
and management. First, our results suggest
makers should understand the limited (or even negative) role
of CSR (or at least the current form of CSR) in enhancing

123

labor rights. In many countries, governments have increased
deregulation and decreased their own role in protecting labor
rights. Accordingly, employers’ discretional responsibility
to their employees has increased. Competitive market pres-
sures and limited resources, however, lead to unbalanced
CSR practices between external and internal responsibilities,
and most ﬁrms involved in CSR do not guarantee the rights of
internal stakeholders. In particular, in emerging markets
where labor regulations are weaker than those of developed
countries, the problem can be even graver. Where this is the
case, governments have to be more active in protecting labor
rights and working conditions instead of relying on private
sector CSR activities.

Second, employers should cultivate a more balanced
approach to CSR. Although harmonizing the interests of all
stakeholders is a difﬁcult (if not impossible) task, sacri-
ﬁcing the interests of internal stakeholders to meet social
demands may lead to undesirable consequences in labor
relations (McAdam and Leonard 2003). A long-term per-
spective that seeks to maintain a balance of CSR activity
between social issues and employee issues may help sus-
tain a ﬁrm’s growth.

The limitations of the present study should be men-
tioned. Because our sample included ﬁrms in a single
country, Korea, nation-speciﬁc characteristics may have
affected our results. Thus, our ﬁndings should be carefully
interpreted before any attempt is undertaken to generalize
the results of this paper. The present study (especially
Study 1) addresses only three dimensions of CSR: com-
munity relations, customer satisfaction, and environmental
protection to the exclusion of other dimensions of CSR
such as suppliers and ﬁnanciers. Since the present study did
not adopt a holistic approach toward CSR, the ﬁndings of
the present study may indicate only that a ﬁrms’ investment
in external CSR (in the areas of community, customer, and
environment) has a negative relationship with internal CSR
in the areas of employment relations.

The present study did not test the causal relationship
between these two variables (i.e., CSR and employment
practices) and only found temporary associations between
the two. Thus, one has to be circumspect in asserting that
the investment in CSR is driving the changing employment
practices and slower hiring growth. In this regard, future
research should be helpful to understand if there is a casual
linkage between these two phenomena: CSR and employ-
ment practices. Some qualitative work may be desirable to
ﬁnd out whether ﬁrms really are making an explicit trade-
off, and to understand fully why managers believe they
have to make this trade-off.
