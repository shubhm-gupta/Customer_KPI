Abstract

The primary objective of this study is to test a theoretical framework relating four major corporate
governance attributes with the extent of voluntary disclosure provided by listed ﬁrms in Hong Kong.
These corporate governance attributes are the proportion of independent directors to total number of
directors on the board, the existence of a voluntary audit committee, the existence of dominant
personalities (CEO/Chairman duality), and the percentage of family members on the board. Using a
weighted relative disclosure index for measuring voluntary disclosure, the results indicate that the
existence of an audit committee is signiﬁcantly and positively related to the extent of voluntary
disclosure, while the percentage of family members on the board is negatively related to the extent of
voluntary disclosure. The study provides empirical evidence to policy makers and regulators in East
Asia for implementing the two new board governance requirements on audit committee and family
control. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

It is commonly agreed that the recent Asian ﬁnancial crisis was not only the result of a loss
in investor conﬁdence but, more importantly, of a lack of effective corporate governance and
transparency in many of Asia’s ﬁnancial markets and individual ﬁrms1. Over the last several
years, most East Asian economies have been actively reviewing and improving their
regulatory frameworks, in particular, corporate governance, transparency and disclosure.

However, the simple adoption of more International Accounting Standards (IAS) is not
sufﬁcient to resolve the transparency problem in these countries. Whether the quality of the
actual corporate disclosures satisﬁes investors’ information needs is more central.

Mandatory disclosure rules ensure equal access to basic information (Lev 1992), but this
information has to be augmented by ﬁrms’ voluntary disclosures and information production
by intermediaries. There are major market incentives to disclose information voluntarily and
managers’ attitudes to voluntary disclosure change according to the perceived relationship of
the costs and beneﬁts involved (e.g., see Gray, Radebaugh and Roberts 1990; Healy and
Palepu 1995). Voluntary disclosure and its determinants have been identiﬁed as an important
research area in ﬁnancial reporting since the 1970s. Previous studies on the determinants of
voluntary disclosure have been done mainly in the U.S. and other developed countries (e.g.,
Malone, Fries and Jones 1993; Schadewitz 1994; Raffournier 1995; Lang and Lundholm
1996).

Some studies have examined institutional mechanisms (i.e., corporate governance) that
may inﬂuence voluntary disclosure practice. Corporate governance attributes examined in
these studies include ownership structure (e.g., Craswell and Taylor 1992; Mckinnon and
Dalimunthe 1993; Hossain, Tan and Adams 1994; Raffournier 1995), the proportion or
existence of independent directors (e.g., Forker, 1992; Malone, Fries and Jones 1993), the
appointment of a nonexecutive director as chairman, (e.g., Forker 1992), and the existence
of an audit committee (e.g., Forker 1992).

However, previous research only studied the effect of one single corporate governance
attribute and very few of them examine different governance attributes in a single study. The
ﬁndings of these studies also may not be applicable to Eastern economies which have
different regulatory and cultural environments. Examining the relationship between corpo-
rate governance attributes and corporate disclosure behavior in Hong Kong, with its unique
regulatory (relatively nonstringent disclosure requirements compared to U.K. and U.S.) and
corporate ownership environment (most listed ﬁrms are family- or individual-controlled),
could provide valuable input to a debate that is increasingly becoming international.

The main objective of this study is therefore to test the relationship between a set of
corporate governance factors (see Fig. 1) and the extent of voluntary disclosure provided by
listed ﬁrms in Hong Kong. Under the implicit assumption of information theory and agency
theory, the study hypothesizes that improved monitoring on the board of directors leads to
more voluntary disclosures.

The importance or potential contributions of this current study are several. First, the
current study examines several corporate governance mechanisms in a single model assum-
ing different mechanisms may offset or interact each other. Second, prior studies did not test
the impact of family control and the current study showed that the proportion of family
members on a board is signiﬁcantly related to the extent of voluntary disclosure. Third, the
Hong Kong data allows a fuller and more powerful approach to analysis as there is
considerable variation in the measures of the explanatory and dependent variables. Last but
not the least, as the study found that the audit committee and family control are signiﬁcant
governance variables, it provides empirical evidence to policy makers and regulators in East
Asia for implementing such new board governance requirements.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the corporate

disclosure and corporate governance environment in Hong Kong and discusses the speciﬁc
hypotheses of this study. Section 3 outlines the research design and study sample. Section 4

the implications of the results.

2. Background and hypothesis development

2.1. Corporate disclosure

Since Hong Kong was a British colony before July 1997, its ﬁnancial reporting system is
largely inﬂuenced by British accounting practices. The mandatory disclosure requirements in
Hong Kong are stipulated by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, the Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC) Ordinance, Listing Rules (Appendix 7A), Listing Agreements,


142

S.S.M. Ho, K.S. Wong / Journal of International Accounting, Auditing & Taxation 10 (2001) 139–156

and the Securities Ordinances promulgated by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK)
(recently renamed as the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing, HKEx), and the Statements of
Standard Accounting Practice (SSAPs) issued by the Hong Kong Society of Accountants
(HKSA).

Overall, the scope of disclosure requirements in Hong Kong is much narrower and less
speciﬁc than that in the U.S. and U.K. (Eccles and Mavrinac 1995). For instance, only
interim (midyear) and year-end reports are provided. Disclosure rules governing insider
dealings, related party transactions, and directors’ interests and remuneration are much less
stringent than in the U.S. Since the Listing Rules and HK SSAPs have guidance status only,
they provide Hong Kong companies with more ﬂexibility in reporting and disclosure.
Consequently, ﬁrms’ disclosure choices are also more likely to reﬂect voluntary responses to
market forces.

Conformity with the Listing Rules and accounting standards by Hong Kong ﬁrms is very
high in general (Tai et al. 1990; HKSA 1997). The only area that has a comparatively low
standard of compliance is on the disclosure of related party transactions (HKICS 1998) due
most likely to a high proportion of family-controlled listed ﬁrms. The Judges’ Report of the
HKMA Best Annual Report Award 1994 (HKMA 1995) noted that many Hong Kong
companies made only the minimum disclosures required by the accounting standards and
statutory provisions. In addition, the quality and quantity of information disclosed in annual
reports varied quite substantially. Listed companies have been advised to disclose more
information voluntarily (SCMP 1998). However, to avoid the danger of over-regulation, the
SEHK hopes to encourage a culture of voluntary disclosure among listed companies. The
SEHK believes that the quality of a company’s disclosures will be reﬂected in its stock price
and its future ability to raise share capital (HKICS 1998). Nevertheless, disclosure require-
ments in Hong Kong are reviewed regularly. For instance, the new Securities and Futures
Bill, to be enacted in late 2001 by the SFC, will introduce additional disclosure requirements
to further combat market misconduct and empower investors (SFC, 2000).

2.2. Corporate governance

Corporate governance is viewed as effectively delineating the rights and responsibilities
of each group of stakeholders in the company. Transparency is one major indicator of the
standard of corporate governance in an economy. In 1993 and 1994, to improve transparency
and accountability, the SEHK and the HKSA set up a Corporate Governance Working Group
(CGWG) respectively prescribing a number of recommended practices (HKSA 1997). These
practices included: separation of CEO and board chairman, a requirement of at least two
(independent) nonexecutive directors, limitation of family members on the board to no more
than 50%, and a requirement for two board committees to be composed mainly of nonex-
ecutive directors (an audit committee and a remuneration committee). An additional require-
ment to appoint at least two nonexecutive directors became effective at the beginning of
1995. The establishment of an audit committee is always voluntary in Hong Kong. In 1998,
the Code of Best Practice was also revised by the SEHK which requires listed ﬁrms to
disclose in their interim and annual reports the reason for the establishment or nonestab-
lishment of audit committees for accounting periods beginning January 1, 1999.

While separation of ownership and control is the predominant form of corporate gover-
nance in the U.S. and U.K., family share control is prevalent in Hong Kong and most other
East Asian countries (La Porta et al. 1999). The ﬁrst report of the HKSA’s CGWG conﬁrmed
that over half of Hong Kong listed companies are majority-controlled by a family or an
individual (HKSA 1997). The ten wealthiest families in Hong Kong owned 46.8% of the
total market capitalization of the SEHK in 1996 (HKSA 1997). Many of these family
members appoint themselves as board directors and senior executives of the ﬁrms and always
vote collectively.

2.3. Hypotheses development

An objective of this study is to determine how corporate governance mechanisms affect
a ﬁrm’s disclosure behaviors. Four corporate governance variables are examined in the
current study2. These are the percentage of independent nonexecutive directors, the existence
of an audit committee, the existence of dominant personalities, and the percentage of family
members on the board.

Jensen and Meckling’s (1976) positive agency theory provides a framework linking
disclosure behavior to corporate governance. Corporate governance mechanisms are intro-
duced to control the agency problem and ensure that managers act in the interests of
shareholders. In theory, the impact of internal governance mechanisms on corporate disclo-
sures may be complementary or substitutive. If it is complementary, agency theory predicts
that a greater extent of disclosures is expected since the adoption of more governance
mechanisms will strengthen the internal control of companies and provide an “intensive
monitoring package” for a ﬁrm to reduce opportunistic behaviors and information asymmetry
(Leftwich, Watts and Zimmerman 1981; Welker 1995). Managers are not likely to withhold
information for their own beneﬁts under such an intensive-monitoring environment, which
lead to improvement in disclosure comprehensiveness and quality of ﬁnancial statements. On
the other hand, if the relationship is substitutive, companies will not provide more disclosures
for more governance mechanisms since one corporate governance mechanism may substitute
another one. If information asymmetry in a ﬁrm can be reduced because of the existing
“internal monitoring packages,” the need for install additional governance devices is smaller.
These apparently conﬂicting viewpoints on the impact of corporate governance have not
been totally resolved. In spite of this theoretical ambiguity, Hill (1999) argues that no one
single mechanism is a governance panacea and suggests that “it is desirable to have a system
of overlapping checks and balances.” Therefore, the hypotheses about the effect of internal
governance mechanisms in the current study are mainly predictions of a positive association.

2.3.1. The proportion of independent nonexecutive directors on board

One major role of boards is its control functions (Pound 1995). Outside (independent)
nonexecutive directors (IND) are perceived as a tool for monitoring management behavior
(Rosenstein and Wyatt 1990), resulting in more voluntary disclosure of corporate informa-
tion. Both Lefwich et al. (1981) and Fama and Jensen (1983) argued that the larger the
proportion of INDs on the board, the more effective it will be in monitoring managerial
opportunism, and companies can be expected to have more voluntary disclosures. Forker


144

S.S.M. Ho, K.S. Wong / Journal of International Accounting, Auditing & Taxation 10 (2001) 139–156

(1992) found that a higher percentage of IND on boards enhanced the monitoring of the
ﬁnancial disclosure quality and reduced the beneﬁts of withholding information. It is
hypothesized that:

H1: Companies with a higher proportion of independent nonexecutive directors are more

likely to have a higher extent of voluntary disclosure.

Although SEHK requirements emphasize the number rather than the proportion of IND to
total directors, the use of a proportion was used in the current study. Independent directors
may not exert sufﬁcient monitoring power if their numbers only account for a small
proportion of board membership.3

2.3.2. The existence of an audit committee

The functions of an audit committee include ensuring the quality of ﬁnancial accounting
and control system (Collier 1993). Since an audit committee consists mainly of nonexecutive
directors, it has inﬂuence to reduce the amount of information withheld. Agency theory
predicts the establishment of audit committees as a means of attenuating agency costs. Forker
(1992) argued that the existence of audit committees may improve internal control and thus
regarded it as an effective monitoring device for improving disclosure quality. He found a
positive but weak relationship between the disclosure of the audit committee and the quality
of share-option disclosure for U.K. companies. McMullen (1996) provides support for the
association between the presence of an audit committee and more reliable ﬁnancial reporting.
It is therefore hypothesized that:

H2: Companies that have an audit committee are more likely to have a higher extent of

voluntary disclosure.

2.3.3. The existence of dominant personalities

Firms that have one individual who serves as both chairman and chief executive ofﬁcer/
managing director (CEO duality) are considered to be more managerially dominated (Molz
1988). The person who occupies both roles would tend to withhold unfavorable information
to outsiders. Fama and Jensen (1983) argued that any adverse consequences could be
eliminated by market discipline. But Forker (1992) asserts that a dominant personality in
both roles poses a threat to monitoring quality and is detrimental to the quality of disclosure.
He found a signiﬁcant negative relationship between the existence of a dominant personality
and the quality of share-option disclosure. Hence, it is hypothesized that:

H3: Companies which appoint a dominant chief executive ofﬁcer as board chairman are

more likely to have a lower extent of voluntary disclosure.

2.3.4. The percentage of family members on the board

Agency theory argues that in a diffused ownership environment, ﬁrms will disclose more
information to reduce agency costs and information asymmetry. In a more concentrated
ownership situation, the impact on voluntary disclosure is more complicated and the argu-
ment can be made in either direction. Jensen and Meckling (1976) indicate that since
managers pursue their own interest, higher management shareholding would imply a larger
sharing of the loss, and ultimately, a lower possibility that management would lower
corporate value.

In contrast to the convergence-of-interests hypothesis, the management entrenchment
hypothesis suggests that under very high concentration of ownership, conﬂicts of interest are
not between managers and shareholders, but between large and small shareholders (Shleifer
and Vishny 1997). When ownership control is high enough to ensure its position, manage-
ment has the incentive to behave against the interests of other smaller shareholders because
of its strong voting power to appoint someone it trusts to be CEO, directors and/or board
chairman (Morck, Shleifer and Vishny 1988). Besides expropriating minority interests
directly, these controlling shareholders can enrich themselves through connected party
transactions in which proﬁts are transferred to other companies they control.

In Hong Kong, since family ownership is often high enough to secure a controlling
position, it is generally believed that the management entrenchment hypothesis should apply.
Corporate boards in Hong Kong are sometimes viewed by international investors simply a
mean to approve the wishes of the family shareholders. Family members’ total shareholding
was not used in the current study to measure family control since such data were not
available in Hong Kong. Instead, the number of family members on the board of directors
was used as a surrogate for family control. On the basis of the management entrenchment
hypothesis, it is hypothesized that:

H4: Companies with a higher proportion of family members sitting on the board are more

likely to have a lower extent of voluntary disclosure.

2.3.5. Other control variables

A review of the literature on voluntary disclosure led to the decision to include ﬁve control
variables in the multiple regression models for testing the main hypotheses. These are ﬁrm
size (Chow and Wong-Boren 1987), assets-in-place (Hossain et al., 1994), ﬁnancial leverage
(Bradbury 1992), proﬁtability (Meek et al. 1995) and industry type (Meek et al. 1995).

3. Data collection and research design

3.1. Survey

A questionnaire survey of the 610 chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcers (CFOs) of all listed ﬁrms in
Hong Kong was conducted to determine the existence of an audit committee in their ﬁrms.
Another version of the questionnaire was sent to 535 ﬁnancial analysts from all investment
or brokerage ﬁrms in Hong Kong in late 1997 and early 1998. The purpose of this survey was
to determine users’ perceptions of the usefulness of various voluntary disclosure items. After
two mailings, 98 CFOs and 92 ﬁnancial analysts returned the survey resulting in response
rates of 17% and 18%, respectively4. For both respondent groups, the responses to all
Likert-scale questions from the last 20 questionnaires returned were compared to the results
of the ﬁrst 20 questionnaires returned in order to check for any nonresponse bias. This
technique, introduced by Oppenheim (1966), indicated no signiﬁcant difference (alpha ⫽
0.05) between those companies who responded earlier and those who responded later. Thus,
assuming that the later respondents were similar to the nonrespondents, there was no
indication of a visible nonresponse bias in the data. To further conﬁrm any nonresponse bias,

additional t tests showed that there was no signiﬁcant difference in all continuous-scale
independent variables and the dependent variable between early and late respondents.
Furthermore, the returned reply slips from 58 CFOs and 45 analysts who declined to
complete the questionnaire indicated that over 97.5% of the nonrespondents did not complete
the questionnaires due to company policy not to entertain research questionnaires or lack of
time5. Table 1 provides demographic information concerning the CFO respondents.

3.2. The measurement of voluntary disclosure

Most previous studies (conducted outside Hong Kong) on determinants of voluntary
disclosure have developed disclosure indices to examine the association with ﬁrm-speciﬁc
characteristics (see e.g., Meek et al. 1995). However, most of the studies did not take into
account users’ perceptions of the importance or usefulness of the disclosure items. In the
current study, the extent of voluntary disclosure was measured by using an importance-
adjusted relative disclosure index (RDI). It was derived by ﬁrst compiling from previous
literature and annual reports in Hong Kong a comprehensive list of voluntary disclosure
items that companies have provided. The list was then checked against a mandatory
disclosure checklist prepared by a Big-5 accounting ﬁrm (Ernst & Young) in Hong Kong.
Items mandated to be disclosed by Hong Kong listed companies were eliminated. The
remaining 35 items were included in a survey questionnaire and the sample of analyst users
was asked to rate the importance of each item on a 5-point scale. After standardizing the
responses to a zero mean and unit variance, a total of 20 of the 35 items with a minimum
importance score of 3.5 were identiﬁed as the base for measuring the RDI.

The RDI was then computed for each sample companies as a ratio of the absolute
disclosure score to the maximum possible disclosure score. The absolute disclosure score for
each company is the total number of items of the 20 most important items disclosed
voluntarily in the annual report. This method of calculating RDI alleviates the concern that
a company may be penalized for not disclosing that is considered irrelevant (e.g., cost of
good sold is not relevant to banks). Since only the items which were perceived by analyst


S.S.M. Ho, K.S. Wong / Journal of International Accounting, Auditing & Taxation 10 (2001) 139–156

147

users as most important were used in computing the RDI, no further subjective weighting
was applied6. The use of disclosure indices is not novel, although the incorporation of users’
perceptions of importance is an extension.

3.3. Measurement of independent variables

Data on all but one of the independent variables were collected from the annual reports of
the responding preparer ﬁrms. Data on the existence of an audit committee was collected
directly from the companies through a postal survey. The proportion of independent non-
executive directors to total number of directors (INDs) is the number of INDs on the board
divided by the total number of directors on the board. The percentage of family members on
board (PFM) is measured as a ratio of family board members to the total number of directors.
The SEHK requires that companies must disclose the relationship or related board members
in the annual report. Further, a binary scheme was used to denote the existence of an audit
committee and dominant personality. These dummy variables were coded ‘1⬘ to indicate
existence and ‘0⬘ to indicate nonexistence. Since the current study uses data from 1997 it
should better reﬂect ﬁrms’ voluntary adoption of audit committees in response to market
forces.

3.4. Measurement of the control variables

Firm size (LSIZE) is measured by the log (base 10) of total assets, leverage (LEV) is
measured by the ratio of total debt to the equity value of the ﬁrm, assets-in-place (AIP) is
measured by the ratio of net book value of ﬁxed assets to total assets, and proﬁtability
(PROFIT) is measured by the return on capital employed. The average of three years
(1994 –97) of data were used to calculate all these measures. Lastly, industry type is based
on the SEHK codes of classiﬁcation of listed companies with some modiﬁcations. Listed
companies are classiﬁed as conglomerate (IT1), manufacturing (IT2), banking and ﬁnance
(IT3), or others (IT4).

4. Analysis and discussion of results

4.1. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis

Table 2 shows the distribution of the dependent variable (i.e., extent of voluntary
disclosure measured by RDI). The average relative disclosure index of the sample companies
was 0.29, with a range of 0.05 to 0.85. Thus, there were large variations in voluntary
disclosure practices among the sample companies in Hong Kong. This result is also consis-
tent with the literature that companies in Hong Kong have great ﬂexibility in their voluntary
disclosure choices. In addition, the relative low voluntary disclosure ratio implies that
analysts in Hong Kong may search for information outside of annual reports (e.g., via
investor relations department).

Table 2 shows that the average ratio of IND to total directors on board was 0.34 and the

average number of IND is 2.45. On the other hand, the average percentage of family
members sitting on the board was 32.1%. Table 3 shows that in 29% of the sample
companies the chairman was also the managing director/chief executive ofﬁcer, and 23.5%
of the companies reported having an independent audit committee.

Table 4 shows that the items most likely to be voluntarily disclosed were the future
prospects of the company (75%), the description of company products and services (60%),
China business review (59%), and sales and marketing network (56%). However, none of the
responding companies disclosed a cash ﬂow forecast and only one percentage of the
companies disclosed information relating to cost of goods sold. The results again indicate
that there was a wide variation in the disclosure of these important items in Hong Kong.

The bivariate analysis in Table 5 shows the highest correlation was between LSIZE (ﬁrms
in the banking and ﬁnance industry) and leverage (LEV) (R2⫽0.576). This should not be a
concern until they exceed 0.8. These results also appear to suggest that no serious multi-
collinearity among the independent variables exist.

From Table 5 it can be observed that leverage, the percentage of family members on the
board and ﬁrm size were signiﬁcantly correlated with the extent of voluntary disclosure at the
0.05 level with the predicted sign. The presence of the expected bivariate relationship is
encouraging as the bivariate ﬁndings provide a basis for interpreting the results of the
multivariate analysis of the extent of voluntary disclosure.

coefﬁcients in the correlation matrix suggest that the problem of multicollinearity was

minimal. However, a certain degree of multicollinearity can still exist even when none of the
bivariate correlation coefﬁcients is very large, since one independent variable may be an
approximate linear function of a set of several independent variables. Another effective
means of testing multicollinearity is to compute the Variance Inﬂation Factor (VIF). The
largest VIF factor observed for the full model was 2.5 (LSIZE) and the VIFs of all other
independent variables were below 2.0. Thus, these results further support the lack of presence
of multicollinearity in the research model. The results of the regression analysis can,
therefore, be interpreted with a greater degree of conﬁdence.

Table 6 presents the R2 (coefﬁcient of determination), F-ratio, beta coefﬁcients and

t-statistics for the model and summarizes the multiple regression results of Y (the extent of
voluntary disclosure) on the explanatory variables. The table indicates R2 of 0.42 (F⫽3.45,
p ⫽ 0.000), which shows that a moderate percentage (42%) of the variation in Y can be
explained by variations in the whole set of independent variables (adjusted R2 ⫽ 0.31). At
the 0.05 level of signiﬁcance, the hypothesis that all explanatory variable coefﬁcients are
simultaneously equal to zero is rejected.

Only ﬁve independent variables entered the equation with a regression coefﬁcient that was
signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level in the regression model. These variables include: audit commit-
tee, ﬁrm size, percentage of family members on the board and two industry dummy variables.
In addition, the directions of the signs of all signiﬁcant coefﬁcients in the regression model
are in agreement with the hypotheses. On the other hand, the ratio of independent directors
to total directors on board, family ownership control, proﬁtability, asset-in-place, and
leverage are insigniﬁcant.

The most signiﬁcant corporate governance variable is the percentage of family members
on board (PFM) with a p-value of 0.02. This provides support for the Hypothesis 4 that the
more family members on the board, the less likely that a ﬁrm has a higher extent of voluntary
disclosure. The next most signiﬁcant variable is the existence of an audit committee, which
has a p-value of 0.049. Thus, Hypothesis 2 that companies that have an audit committee are
likely to have a higher extent of voluntary disclosure is also supported. In addition, large
ﬁrms tend to have more voluntary disclosure (p ⬍ 0.01). This result supports numerous
previous empirical studies which show that large ﬁrms disclose more information. This could
occur because large ﬁrms need more ﬁnancing capital than smaller ﬁrms.

4.4. Discussion of ﬁndings

A comparison of the ﬁndings of the current study with previous related studies can be
found in Table 7. Hypothesis 1 which states that companies with a higher ratio of indepen-
dent nonexecutive directors to total directors on board would more likely have a higher
extent of voluntary disclosure was not supported. This ﬁnding is not consistent with the
ﬁndings of Forker (1992) and Chen and Jaggi’s (1998) which found that the proportion of
independent nonexecutive directors on board was positively related to the quality/extent of
ﬁnancial disclosure. Chen and Jaggi’s disclosure index score includes both mandatory and
voluntary disclosure items but the index score adopted in this study includes only the
voluntary disclosure items perceived as most important by analysts. Thus, a possible
explanation of this result is that while IND in Hong Kong are likely to ensure that the
company has complied with mandatory disclosure requirements, they are still not actively
pressing the company to disclose more nonmandatory information. Also, there are questions
about the independence of so-called ‘independent’ nonexecutive directors in Hong Kong and
their effectiveness as a monitoring device as many of them are appointed by the CEO or the
board chairman.

Hypothesis 2 which states that companies which have an audit committee are more likely
to have a higher extent of voluntary disclosure was supported. This result is encouraging
since a previous study by Forker (1992) only found a weak relationship between the
existence of an audit committee and the quality (extent) of disclosure. An important

implication of this ﬁnding is that it may be appropriate for regulatory authorities to require
listed companies in Hong Kong to establish an audit committee in order to secure more
corporate transparency.

Hypothesis 3 states that ﬁrms with the existence of a dominant personality are more likely
to have a lower extent of disclosure. Although the hypothesized direction was correct, the
hypothesis was not supported at the 5% signiﬁcance level. This result is not consistent with
that of Forker (1992) who found a signiﬁcant negative relationship between a dominant
personality and quality (extent) of disclosure. A possible reason is a person who serves as
both board chairman and CEO of a company in Hong Kong is likely to be a substantial
shareholder, so it does not matter whether or not the two jobs are separated.

Hypothesis 4, which states that companies with a higher proportion of family members on
the board are more likely to have a lower extent of voluntary disclosure, was supported. Chen
and Jaggi (1998) also found that the relationship between independent nonexecutive directors
and total ﬁnancial disclosure (mandatory and voluntary) was weaker for family-controlled
ﬁrms. Although the situation where family members dominate the board is not as common
in Hong Kong as one might expect, these ﬁndings might have implications for other Asian
countries where it is common for family members to dominate the board. The recommen-
dation by the HKSA Second Report of Corporate Governance that family members should
not make up more than half of the board membership seems valid and should be maintained.
Boards composed of a wider membership would help strengthen the transparency of the
company.

5. Summary and conclusion

In recent years, regulatory bodies have promulgated new corporate governance require-
ments in order to enhance corporate transparency. In Asia the recent ﬁnancial crisis has
underlined the need for more evidence on the corporate governance and transparency issues.
There has been little research relating voluntary disclosure to speciﬁc corporate governance
attributes. This study uses Hong Kong data to analyze whether ﬁrms disclose more voluntary
information when they are family-controlled, have an audit committee, have independent
board directors, and have a duality of board chairman/CEO.

There are several important implications of this study. The results provide empirical
evidence to support Hong Kong regulatory bodies’ certain new requirements on board
composition, that is, the formation of an audit committee and the family members should not
make up more than half of the board membership. These results may also help other East
Asia reformers, policy makers and regulators to improve market transparency in their
countries by introducing similar new requirements. In particular, the vast majority of listed
companies in East Asia economies are owned and controlled by families. It is essential to
have a higher degree of minority investors’ protection via more such corporate governance
devices.

There are two major limitations of this study. First, the main focus of this study is on the
extent of voluntary disclosures. However, such disclosures do not mean that they are credible
or reﬂecting the true state of affairs of the company. Also, more disclosures do not


154

S.S.M. Ho, K.S. Wong / Journal of International Accounting, Auditing & Taxation 10 (2001) 139–156

necessarily imply more quality disclosures. Second, although the study found the expected
relationship between corporate governance variables and disclosures, it is not certain whether
the results were due to the hypothesized causality. Therefore, the ﬁndings should be
interpreted with care because of these limitations. Future studies in this area should address
these speciﬁc issues directly.

Notes

1. Transparency refers to “a process by which information about existing conditions,
decisions and actions is made accessible, visible and understandable (Working Group
on International Financial Crisis, 1998). Operationally, it is referred to voluntary
disclosure in addition to the already mandated disclosure.

2. Some corporate governance and ﬁrm-speciﬁc variables which had been considered
initially during the research planning process were ﬁnally excluded. For example,
using the services of a Big-5/non-Big-5 audit ﬁrm was excluded because nearly all
listed companies are audited by Big-5 ﬁrms in Hong Kong. Family’s share ownership,
directors’ share ownership and independent nonexecutives’ share ownership were not
used due to the lack of exact and direct share ownership data publicly available in
Hong Kong.

3. On the other hand, one may argue that even one or two IND can also exert inﬂuence
if they are vocal on a particular issue. Therefore, besides proportion of IND to total
directors, the current study also used the number of IND in a supplementary test.
However, since the result of the supplementary test did not differ from the model
using the proportion of IND, only the ﬁndings on the proportion of IND are presented.
4. Fifty-ﬁve completed preparer questionnaires and 42 completed user questionnaires
were returned within two weeks of the ﬁrst mailing. The researcher sent follow-up
letters to all targeted ﬁrms to remind those who had not responded in the ﬁrst mailing,
along with an additional copy of the questionnaire and a reply envelope. The
follow-up reminder emphasized the importance of the research, its practical focus and
in addition, requested them to give the reason (s) by returning the bottom slip of the
letter if they decided not to return the questionnaire. A further 43 completed preparer
questionnaires and 50 completed user questionnaires were received within two weeks
of the second mailing. Data collection was completed about ten weeks after the initial
distribution of the questionnaires.

5. It is well known that Hong Kong ﬁrms are very conservative and generally unwilling
to allow studies by outsiders (Redding and Pugh, 1986). Thus, although the response
rate of this study is not high compared with similar studies in other countries, this rate
can be considered satisfactory for a company survey conducted in Hong Kong.

6. Assuming the maximum possible disclosure score for a ﬁrm is 18 (i.e., two others are
irrelevant to its business) and the ﬁrm did disclose 12 out of the 18 items in is annual
report, then the RDI ⫽ 12/18 ⫽ 0.67.
