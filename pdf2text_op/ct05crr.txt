reputation is inﬂuenced by customers’ satisfac-
tion, which is a mediator in the relationship
between the ﬁrm’s quality of products/services
and reputation. Reputation is associated with
the ﬁrm’s growth and accumulation of custo-

This study emphasizes two major ﬁnd-
ings. First, high quality of products is not
directly associated with overall perceived
organizational reputation. Rather, the rela-
tionship between quality of products/ser-
vices
organizational
reputation is mediated by customer satis-
faction. Secondly, the empirical ﬁndings of
this study suggest that the eﬀect of per-
ceived organizational
reputation on the
ﬁrm’s proﬁtability and ﬁnancial strength is
not direct. Hence, top management should
not perceive the ﬁrm’s growth as the ulti-
mate and only goal. Rather, both the
ﬁrm’s growth and its market share serve as
mediating variables in gaining high proﬁt-
ability.

This paper is organized as follows. The
next section describes the theoretical back-
ground of organizational reputation as a
strategic resource that yields a sustainable
competitive advantage and leads to a super-
ior performance by the organization. The
conceptual model and hypotheses are then
presented. The research method — partici-
pants, measures and data analysis — is fol-
lowed by the results of the study. Finally,
there is a discussion, which lists the limita-
tions of this research and suggests areas for
future research.


THE THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

performance

The Resource-based View of the Firm
Organizational reputation is of increasing
interest to researchers and practitioners in
resource-based strategic management. The
RBV suggests that ﬁrms should be ana-
lyzed in terms of their resources, not only
in terms of their product market activities
(Wernerfelt, 1984). A basic premise is that
ﬁrms are not alike. Diﬀerent ﬁrms are
expected to possess diﬀerent proﬁles of
resources
(Amit and Schoemaker, 1993;
Peteraf, 1993) and this heterogeneity of
organizational resources — both tangible
and intangible — accounts for diﬀerences
in ﬁrms’ competitive advantage and varia-
bility
and
Hamel, 1990; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990).
Resources are considered strategic or core
if
they diﬀerentiate a ﬁrm strategically
(Leonard-Barton, 1992). The fundamental
insight of the RBV is in steering research-
ers toward ﬁrm-speciﬁc resources as the
real
competitive
advantage and above-normal performance
of the ﬁrm (Ghemawat and Pisano, 2000;
Penrose, 1959; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990;
Rumelt, 1984; Teece et al., 1997; Werner-
felt, 1984). Thus, when using the term
resource it means a strategic resource, one that
creates a competitive advantage. Competi-
tive advantage is generated only when a
ﬁrm is implementing a value-creating strat-
egy that is not simultaneously being imple-
mented by any current or potential
competitors and when these other ﬁrms are
unable to duplicate the beneﬁts of
this
strategy (Barney, 1991: 102). Collis and
Montgomery have encapsulated the ratio-
nale behind the RBV, whereby resources
are ‘the substance of
the very
essence of sustainable competitive advan-
tage’ (1998: 27). Intangible resources are
very important for achieving a competitive
advantage (eg Ambrosini and Bowman,
2001) because they are valuable, rare, diﬃ-

(Barney, 1991, 1997; Dierickx and

Cool, 1989; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990;
Peteraf, 1993).

Organizational Reputation — Deﬁnition
Organizational reputation is a construct
that is not easy to deﬁne (eg Dowling,
1988). The inherent diﬃculty in ﬁnding a
sole explicit deﬁnition for this construct
results from the wide range of facets it
embodies. The concept reputation is used by
several diﬀerent disciplines, each of which
deﬁnes
it diﬀerently (Deephouse, 2000:
1093). Furthermore, reputation is deter-
mined according to the observer’s percep-
tions
and
Montgomery, 1998: 65). Researchers per-
ceive reputation as a ‘fragile resource’
(Hall, 1993: 616), which changes over time
(Ching et al., 1992: 291), yet enjoys relative
stability (Barney, 1997: 226), reﬂects cumu-
lative investments (Fombrun and Shanley,
1990: 254) and exists as a concept distinct
from other organizational behavior con-
structs (Jones, 1996: 286).

The Strategic Role of
Organizational Reputation
A critical question is to what extent orga-
nizational reputation is considered to be a
strategic resource of the ﬁrm. Having a
favorable organizational reputation means
that the ﬁrm’s constituencies perceive the
ﬁrm as more attractive than other ﬁrms.
The decision of
to

supplier over the others is based on infor-
mation including recommendations regard-
ing each supplier’s reputation. Thus
the
choice is based, at least to some extent,
upon the reputation — favorable or unfa-
vorable — of those suppliers. This point is
also emphasized by Dollinger et al. (1997),
who note that a ﬁrm’s reputation is an
important criterion in it being targeted for
a joint venture. Podolny (1993) argued that
a favorable status in the market enables a
ﬁrm to access critical
resources. Stuart
et al. (1999) found that the ability of young
biotech ﬁrms to acquire critical resources
for survival and growth depends on the
prestige of their aﬃliates (eg alliance part-

relationships with

Organizational reputation is an intangi-
ble resource, representing an overall assess-
ment of the ﬁrm’s current assets, position
and expected future performance (Teece et
al., 1997: 521). As a core resource, organi-
zational reputation could be a major factor
in gaining a competitive advantage and
fortifying the organization’s ﬁnancial posi-
tion because it is diﬃcult for competitors
to match the prestige and esteem created
by reputation (Hall, 1992: 138). According
to Shrum and Wuthnow (1988: 909),

characteristics to constituents in order to
maximize their economic and non-eco-
nomic (social) status (Fombrun and Shan-
ley, 1990: 234). Based on Fombrun (1996)
and Fombrun and Shanley (1990), a favor-
able organizational reputation may gener-
ate several competitive advantages
for a
ﬁrm, including (1) delaying rivals’ mobility
in the industry,

man (1997: 10), status is most valuable in
those markets in which consumers ﬁnd it
diﬃcult to observe the true quality of the
goods or services and when producers are
certain as to which resource allocation deci-
sions will result in outputs that are highly
valued by customers.

(1997)
showed that corporate reputation

based measures, particularly return on

dictors of a ﬁrm’s reputation for social
responsibility. Hammond
Slocum

Quality of Products/Services,
Customers’ Satisfaction and
Organizational Reputation
A ﬁrm has a good reputation if consumers
believe its products to be of high quality
(Shapiro, 1983). Thus, high-quality ﬁrms
are often high-reputation ﬁrms, or blue-chip
companies (Antunovich et al., 2000). Most

investigate the relationship between QP/S
and organizational reputation, rather than
assigning a direct relationship between a
ﬁrm’s QP/S and performance.

Corporate reputation is determined by
the core images or perceptions of the com-
pany that are held by multiple constituen-
cies. Underlying those perceptions is the
impression made by the quality of
the
ﬁrm’s products and services. General Elec-
tric (GE) sustained its ongoing favorable
reputation’s
status by using a particular
image of QP/S: ‘We bring good things to
life’. The QP/S is at the core of GE’s repu-
tation. Recently, Garud and Lampel (1997)
showed that improper product announce-
ment ultimately would harm a company’s
reputation deeply. This ﬁnding suggests
that a ﬁrm’s QP/S should meet the expec-
tations of the customers, thus increasing
satisfaction with its products and services.
Johnson & Johnson’s credo, written in 1943
by its chairman Robert Wood Johnson, is
a good example. It states, ‘We believe our
ﬁrst responsibility is to the doctors, nurses

Page 18


Carmeli and Tishler

(doctors, nurses, etc)

and patients, to mothers and fathers and all
others who use our products and services.
In meeting their needs, everything we do
must be of high quality’
(Alsop, 1999).
Johnson & Johnson’s credo suggests that
the quality of the products and/or services
alone is not suﬃcient for meeting custo-
mers’
satisfaction.
Another example is Check Point Software
Technologies,
an Israeli-based network
security company, which has become the
top internet security provider, with some
52 per cent of the world’s virtual private
networks (VPN) market, as of July 2000.
In its ﬁrst days, one of the company’s foun-
ders, Gil Shwed, directed eﬀorts toward
gaining a reputation as a government and
military software provider,
this
ensured quality approval for the company’s
products from a highly valued customer,
the Israel Defense Force (IDF). Today,
Check Point’s success is attributed not only
to the reliability, credibility and trust-
worthiness of its products, but mostly for
to save
its ability to enable customers
‘easily US$60,000 a month’
(Pruzman,
2001). In line with these arguments, the
following hypotheses are proposed:

since

H1a: A ﬁrm’s quality of products/services is
positively related to organizational
reputation.

H1b: A ﬁrm’s quality of products/services is

faction.

H1c: Customers’

reputation. The present model
suggests
that organizational reputation has a direct
inﬂuence only on two performance mea-
sures — the ﬁrm’s growth and accumula-
tion of customers’ orders (ACO) (clearly,
proﬁtability depends on,
in addition to
ACO and the ﬁrm’s growth, the produc-
tion cost and eﬃciency of the ﬁrm). Firms
with a favorable organizational reputation
have the ability to enhance their ACO and
turnover. Penrose (1959) claimed that the
ﬁrm’s growth is dependent on its resources
and Itami with Roehl (1987) emphasized
the importance of
intangible (invisible)
resources. Yoon et al. (1993) showed that
intentions of customers to buy an insurance
program depend on the reputation of the
insurance company. Shapiro (1983) argued
that
favorable product-quality-based
reputation enables a ﬁrm to require a pre-
mium, which eventually provides a ﬂow of
proﬁts that compensates the seller for the
resources expended in building up the
reputation. Although a ﬁrm’s reputation
does not necessarily constitute a barrier to
entry, but is more likely a cost of entry
(Shapiro, 1983),
the ﬁrm not
only to maintain its customers, but also to
recruit new ones, which enhances
the
ﬁrm’s turnover. As building up and main-
taining a good reputation takes time and
resources, however,
it is unreasonable to
expect that the premium the ﬁrm demands
from its customers will compensate for the
investment in the short term. Thus, it can
be expected that the growth in ACO and
revenues will only eventually be trans-
formed into proﬁts.

Organizational Reputation and
Multiple Performance
The right side of the model depicted in

ing the inﬂuence of organizational reputa-
tion with an independent measure of
performance, it is better to analyze multi-
attribute measures of performance and
how they are inﬂuenced by organizational

ACO and the ﬁrm’s growth (eg growth
in sales) may aﬀect other performance mea-
sures. The authors expect that the ﬁrm’s
growth would enhance its market share
and proﬁtability, which, in turn, aﬀects the
ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial strength. It is also expected
that ACO will be associated with market
share, but not necessarily with the ﬁrm’s
proﬁtability. The rationale behind these

Page 19

if

relationships is that the ﬁrm’s growth is not
an assurance of ﬁnancial strength. Rather,
it enables the ﬁrm to recruit and maintain
customers and position it as a dominant
actor in the market. Eventually,
the
ﬁrm’s production and distribution are eﬃ-
cient,
it will be transformed into proﬁts.
The collapse of many internet-based ﬁrms
during 2000–01 resulted from a mistaken
strategy of setting growth in revenues and
market share as the ﬁrms’ objectives rather
than long-term proﬁtability and ﬁnancial
strength. In accordance with these argu-
ments, the following hypotheses are pro-
posed:

H2a: Organizational

reputation is posi-

tively related to the ﬁrm’s growth.

H2b: Organizational

reputation is posi-
tively related to the accumulation of
customers’ orders (ACO).

H2c: ACO is positively related to the

share.

A questionnaire to the enterprise’s CEO

envelope. In order to encourage the partici-
pants to take part in this study, two com-
mitments were made. First, a cover letter
guaranteed the complete anonymity of the
respondents. Secondly,
the authors pro-
mised to deliver the results and conclusions
of this study to all participants. Two mail-
ing waves were conducted in order to
obtain a high response rate. In total 95
questionnaires were returned, yielding a
response rate of approximately 32 per cent
(this response rate is similar to previous
studies of
the same research population
(Segev, 1987)). Due to missing data, only
86 questionnaires were usable for
this
study. About 20 per cent of the enterprises
belonged to the high-tech sector. The aver-


age age of the enterprises was 27.7 years
(standard deviation (s.d.) 15.2). The sam-
ple’s average number of employees was 94
and the average annual turnover was about
US$15m. The average age of the CEOs of
the enterprises was 49 years (s.d. 7) and
their mean tenure in the organization was
5.5 years (s.d. 4.4). All but one of the
respondents were men. The majority of the
CEOs (87 per cent) held at least a BA-level
degree. The other 13 per cent had 14 or
less years of education.

Measures
The study analyzed the relations between
measures of quality of products/services,
customers’ satisfaction, perceived organiza-
tional reputation and performance mea-
in the
sures of
sample. These measures
are described

Firm performance
Five measures of the performance of each
ﬁrm were included in this study: growth,
strength, market
proﬁtability, ﬁnancial
share
customers’
future orders (deﬁnitions are given below).
The participants were asked to rate their
ﬁrm’s performance relative to its competi-
tors. Each measure was assessed on a ﬁve-
point scale (ranging from 1 = much less
than the competitors, 2 = less
than the
competitors, 3 = as good as the competi-
tors, 4 = better than the competitors, to
5 = much better than the competitors).
Firm’s growth was measured by the rate of
growth in the ﬁrm’s revenues relative to
last year. The proﬁtability measure included
two items: proﬁt margin (the
ratio
between annual proﬁts before taxes and
annual
revenues) and return on equity
(ROE: the ratio between proﬁts after taxes
and total stockholders’ equity). The Cron-
bach alpha reliability coeﬃcient of
this
measure was 0.86. Financial
strength is
deﬁned as the extent to which a ﬁrm is

able to cover its current
liabilities with
assets that can be converted quickly into
cash. Speciﬁcally, this measure equaled the
ratio between the ﬁrm’s current assets and
its current liabilities. Market share gain was
deﬁned as the enterprise’s estimate of last
year’s change in its market share. Finally,

Perceived organizational reputation
This measure was based on Fortune Maga-
zine’s ‘Annual Survey of America’s Most
Admired Corporations’. This
survey is
conducted among 8,000 top executives,
outside directors and ﬁnancial analysts,
who are asked to rate the ten largest com-
panies in their own industry on eight attri-
butes, using a scale of 0 (poor)
to 10
(excellent). The attributes are quality of
management; quality of products or ser-
vices;3
long-term invest-
ment value; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to
attract, develop and retain talented people;
community and environmental responsibil-
ity; and use of corporate assets (eg Smith,
1990). This index has been used in numer-
ous
studies, eg Fombrun and Shanley
(1990); Fryxell and Wang (1994); Gate-
wood et al.
(1993) and McGuire et al.
(1988). Some studies have used this index
of reputation to evaluate overall corporate
reputation (eg Fombrun and Shanley,
1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994), while
others used only its components, mainly
corporate social responsibility (eg Ham-
mond and Slocum, 1996; McGuire et al.,
1988).

Fortune Magazine’s ‘Corporate Reputa-
tion Index’ often has been criticized. It has
been argued that (1) from the start, the
index was not

Fryxell and Wang, 1994; Wood, 1995); (3)
the survey is limited to a certain population
(ie large US corporations) and has not been
extended to other business populations.
Nevertheless, this index is well regarded in
the literature. Here the overall index was
used, rather than a subset of its components,
since previous
(eg Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994)
have found using factor analysis that all
eight components of the index were loaded
on a single factor. A test of a one-factor
model, applied to this study’s overall cor-
porate reputation index, yielded a good ﬁt;
both the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) and
the incremental ﬁt index (IFI) obtained a
value of 0.98. The participants were asked
to indicate to what extent they agreed or
disagreed with each one of the eight com-
ponents of
the index. The components
were assessed on a seven-point scale, ran-
ging from 1 = ‘Strongly disagree’
to
7 = ‘Strongly agree’. The reliability of the
measure used in this study was 0.77.

Customers’ satisfaction
This measure assessed the extent to which
the ﬁrm fulﬁlled the customers’ need,
in
relation to its competitors (eg Collis and
Montgomery, 1998). The respondents were
asked to indicate the extent to which their
customers were satisﬁed with the ﬁrm.
This item was measured on a ﬁve-point
scale (ranging from 1 = much less than
the competitors, 2 = less than the compe-
the competitors,
titors, 3 = as good as
4 = better
the
competitors,
to
5 = much better than the competitors).

Quality of the ﬁrm’s products/services

To test the research model presented in

using LISREL VIII (Joreskog and Sorbom,
1993).
the
research model
in Figure 1, the authors
relied on multiple goodness-of-ﬁt indices,
since no single indicator has been demon-
strated as superior in the structural equation
modeling (SEM) (Medsker et al., 1994). Fol-
lowing Bentler and Bonnet (1980), Joreskog
and Sorbom (1993) and Kline (1998), the
indices relied upon here included the w2 sta-
tistic divided by the degree of freedom (w2/
df) (recommended to be less than three).
Joreskog and Sorbom (1993) pointed out
that even if all the assumptions underlying
the use of the w2 test hold, it might not be
realistic to assume that the model holds
exactly in the population. Thus, it is useful
to also consider other, less sensitive, tests.
These include the root mean squared error
of approximation (RMSEA) (its value is
recommended to be up to 0.05 and is accep-
table up to 0.08),
index
(RFI), the normed ﬁt index (NFI) and the
comparative ﬁt
index (CFI), which is
recommended to be >0.90 and close to a
value of 1.00. In addition, the parsimony
normed ﬁt index (PNFI) (James et al., 1982)
(the closer the value of the PNFI to 1.00,
the more eﬃcient
the model) and the
expected cross-validation index (ECVI)
were used.

collinearity among the research variables
was probably not severe (Nunnaly, 1978).

Path Analysis
Table 2 shows the results of a path analysis
among the model’s variables and the rele-
vant test statistics. The estimates highlight
several
interesting ﬁndings. The research
model, depicted in Figure 1, was almost
fully supported by the data (see Figure 2).
Contrary to H1a, no signiﬁcant path was
found between quality of products/services
and organizational reputation. H2h, which
predicted that market share will be posi-
tively related to ﬁnancial strength, was not
supported either. Signiﬁcant relationships
were found among all the other proposed
paths and all the other hypotheses of the
model were supported by the data. The
ﬁndings suggest that there is no direct rela-
tionship between the quality of products/
services
reputation.
Rather, these two variables are connected
(mediated) via the variable customers’ satis-
faction. The path between the variables
quality of products/services and customers’
satisfaction was signiﬁcant (0.50), suggest-
ing that positive customers’ satisfaction is

and organizational

required to gain a favorable organizational
reputation and customer
satisfaction is
obtained if the ﬁrm’s quality of products/
services is high.

Generally, the results in Table 2 show
that a ﬁrm with high performance has a
favorable organizational
reputation. The
relationship between organizational reputa-
tion and performance, however, is indirect.
The estimates
in Figure 2 and Table 2
point to signiﬁcant paths between organi-
zational reputation and the ﬁrm’s growth
(0.405) and between organizational reputa-
tion and the accumulation of customers’
orders (0.278). There were also signiﬁcant
connections (paths) between the accumula-
tion of customers’ orders and the ﬁrm’s
growth (0.464) and between the accumula-
tion of customers’ orders and market share
(0.334). As expected,
the ﬁrm’s growth
was signiﬁcantly connected to market share
(0.353)
and to the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability
(0.318). Market share was connected with
the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability (0.278), but did not
directly inﬂuence ﬁnancial strength (corre-
lation of 0.084, see Table 2). Market share
signiﬁcantly aﬀected the ﬁrm’s proﬁtabil-
ity, which,
aﬀected ﬁnancial
strength (0.278).

DISCUSSION

Implications
The goal of this study was to highlight the
strategic role that perceived organizational
reputation plays in creating superior per-
formance among industrial enterprises. As
pointed out by Petrick et al. (1999: 60),
‘reputation, whether or not it is embodied
in a trademark, should receive constant lea-
dership attention’. Strategists and econo-
mists have devoted considerable eﬀorts to
detecting the strategic role of organiza-
tional reputation in creating SCA that, in
turn,
leads to superior performance. The
logic behind attributing a strategic role to
organizational reputation is the acknowl-
edgment among academics and practi-
tioners that having a good reputation is the
outcome of a competitive process in which
ﬁrms signal their key characteristics to their
constituents and stakeholders in order to
maximize their economic and non-eco-
nomic position (Shrum and Wuthnow,
1988; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Much
less attention has been devoted, however,
to the interrelationship between reputation
that is based on quality of products/service,
reputation that is based on customers’ satis-
faction, overall organizational reputation
and multivariate measures of performance.
This study’s major goal was to bridge this
gap by presenting and empirically testing a
conceptual model that ties up all of these
relationships.

The ﬁndings of this study support the
premise that organizational reputation has
a strategic role in the ﬁrm’s attempt to
obtain a competitive edge in the market.
The ﬁndings here suggest some interesting
theoretical and managerial implications. It
has long been proposed that quality of pro-
ducts/service-based reputation is associated
with overall organizational
reputation.

This study’s ﬁndings do not support this
proposition. Rather,

tation,
satisfaction
plays a signiﬁcant mediating role. These
ﬁndings suggest that high-quality products/
services alone do not ensure a favorable
organizational
reputation. Many ﬁrms
developed high-quality products that were
rejected by potential customers soon after
their introduction to the market. This fact
does not imply that the high quality of
products/services is not an important factor
in creating a favorable organizational repu-
tation. Rather, it suggests that this factor
alone is not suﬃcient to guarantee organi-
zational reputation. Only high quality pro-
ducts/services
customers’
expectations and assure customers’ satisfac-
tion create a suﬃcient condition for a
favorable organizational
reputation. The
case of Ford’s Edsel is a good example of
this situation. In the ﬁrst half of the 1950s,
Ford decided to develop a moderately
priced car. Extensive market studies were
conducted at that time to detect customers’
preference for this type of car. The Edsel
was introduced to the market in 1957 and
soon became a major failure. The public
expected a vehicle that provided a signiﬁ-
cant advancement toward something that
had never been seen before. The Edsel had
a new design and was a powerful vehicle,
but it failed to meet customers’ expecta-
tions and, hence, preferences (satisfaction).

This study’s ﬁndings suggest that per-
ceived organizational reputation inﬂuences
the ﬁrm’s performance. The results support
the

measures. Building a favorable organiza-
tional reputation is a lengthy and costly
process and the returns on organizational
reputation should be expected in the long
term. Thus, the authors expect organiza-
tional reputation to have a direct eﬀect on
the ﬁrm’s growth and accumulation of cus-

tomers’ orders. This ﬁnding is consistent
with the results of Yoon et al. (1993), who
suggest that the intention to buy an insur-
ance program is a function of the insurance
company’s reputation. Top management
should not expect a quick return on repu-
tation. Rather, they need to acknowledge
that building reputation as a strategic
resource and positioning it as a sustainable
competitive advantage is achieved, as in
Southwest Airlines, by a large number of
activities that complement and strengthen
each other (Porter, 1996).

the

The return on reputation eventually will
be gained by converting the ﬁrm’s growth
into larger market share and sustained prof-
itability. Domination in
relevant
market is extremely important in setting
new rules and standards, as well as barriers
to entry that enable ﬁrms to charge pre-
miums. The domination of Microsoft in
the market for PC operating systems is an
important reason for its high proﬁtability.
Top management should not perceive their
ﬁrm’s growth as
the ultimate and only
goal. Rather, the ﬁrm’s growth is one of
two (market share is the other) mediator
variables
for gaining high proﬁtability.
Finally, these results show that sustained
ﬁnancial strength is a function of the ﬁrm’s
proﬁtability and is not directly aﬀected by
market share. This ﬁnding suggests
that
top management
should be aware that
market share is by no means an assurance
of ﬁnancial strength. Market share serves
only as an indicator of the ﬁrm’s current
proﬁtability.

Limitations of the Study and Suggestions
for Future Research
Several limitations of this study should be
mentioned. First, although the study relies
on the growing body of literature about
resource-based strategy and organizational
reputation,
the model presented here is
new and the data must be cautiously inter-
preted. Secondly, the empirical model pro-

Page 26

the perceptions of

posed here is a preliminary method that
should be put to other tests. Thirdly, data
from a particular set of industrial enter-
prises were used;
investigations
should be conducted on other data sets and
other types of organizations in order to
extend the validity of this model. Fourthly,
two variables
(customer satisfaction and
quality of products/services) are single-item
scales and, thus, should be interpreted cau-
tiously. Finally,
the
industrial enterprises’ CEOs were exam-
ined. Clearly, using single-source data is a
major limitation. This research design may
yield response bias towards overestimating
the prestige of an organization. Some sec-
ondary data, which were available to com-
pare responses
to performance measures
such as growth and return on sales with
the responses received, were used. This
comparison, although for a very small
number of ﬁrms, indicated that the CEOs’
responses represented the secondary data
quite well. A further examination yielded
no relationship between CEOs’ tenure in
the organization and their perceptions of
organizational reputation (r = 0.06, n.s.).
This ﬁnding indicates that the mean level
of reported perceived organizational repu-
tation by leaders with little experience in
their position was statistically equivalent to
the reports of
leaders who had longer
experience in their position. If leaders’ ego-
centric biases signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced their
reports of perceived organizational reputa-
tion,
longer-tenured leaders would likely
have reported, on average, higher levels of
perceived organizational
reputation than
short-tenured leaders.4 Finally, the results
from Harman’s one-factor test (Podsakoﬀ
et al., 2003; Podsakoﬀ and Organ, 1986)
suggest that one dominant factor did not
emerge, because it accounts
for only a
the variance.

Researchers may need to use multivariate
measures and multivariate analysis in order
to uncover the interrelationships between
organizational reputation and multiple per-

to explore
complex relationships
between quality of products/services, custo-
mers’ satisfaction and organizational repu-

that ﬁrms may need to account for several
types of reputation,
including reputation
based on the quality of products/services
and reputation based on the customers’
satisfaction.

compares with their rivals. A similar item was
also included, using a diﬀerent question (the
respondents were to indicate whether they agreed
or disagreed that their ﬁrm features high quality
of products and/or services), in the measure of the
quality of the ﬁrm’s products and/or services. The
correlation between the two items was 0.37, sug-
gesting that they were suﬃciently diﬀerent from
each other.

4 The authors believe that the non-signiﬁcant corre-
lation between a CEO’s tenure and perceived orga-
nizational reputation indicates that this study does
not suﬀer from severe response bias. However, this
correlation need not be an informative measure of
this phenomenon. Thanks go to a referee for this
point.
