Signiﬁcant research attention has been devoted to examining the re-
lationship between HR practices and ﬁrm performance, and research
support has assumed HR as the causal variable. Using data from 45
business units (with 62 data points), this study examines how measures
of HR practices correlate with past, concurrent, and future operational
performance measures. The results indicate that correlations with per-
formance measures at all 3 times are both high and invariant, and that
controlling for past or concurrent performance virtually eliminates the
correlation of HR practices with future performance. Implications are
discussed.

The desire of human resource (HR) practitioners to demonstrate the
value of what they do for the rest of the organization has a long history.
Drucker (1954) referred to “personnel” managers as constantly worrying
about “their inability to prove that they are making a contribution to the
enterprise,” (p. 275). This has been echoed more recently by Tom Stewart,
who described HR leaders as being “unable to describe their contribution
to value added except in trendy, unquantiﬁable and wannabe terms. . .”
(Stewart, 1996, p. 105).

In response to these longstanding and repeated criticisms that HR does
not add value to organizations, the past 10 years has seen a burgeoning of

research attempting to demonstrate that progressive HR practices result
in higher organizational performance. Huselid’s (1995) groundbreaking
study demonstrated that a set of HR practices he referred to as high per-
formance work systems (HPWS) were related to turnover, accounting
proﬁts, and ﬁrm market value.

Since then, a number of studies have shown similar positive relation-
ships between HR practices and various measures of ﬁrm performance.
For instance, MacDufﬁe (1995) found that “bundles” of HR practices
were related to productivity and quality in his sample of worldwide auto
assembly plants. Delery and Doty (1996) found signiﬁcant relationships
between HR practices and accounting proﬁts among a sample of banks.
Youndt, Snell, Dean, and Lepak (1996) found that among their sample of
manufacturing ﬁrms, certain combinations of HR practices were related
to operational performance indicators. More recently, Guthrie (2001) sur-
veyed corporations in New Zealand and found that their HR practices
were related to turnover and proﬁtability. This vein of research has been
summarized by Huselid and Becker who stated “Based on four national
surveys and observations on more that 2,000 ﬁrms, our judgment is that
the effect of a one standard deviation change in the HR system is 10–
20% of a ﬁrm’s market value” (Huselid & Becker, 2000, p. 851, emphasis
added).

Certainly, the existing research suggests a positive relationship be-
tween HR and performance. However, contrary to Huselid and Becker’s
(2000) claim, this body of work tends to lack sufﬁcient methodological
rigor to demonstrate that the relationship is actually causal in the sense
that HR practices, when instituted, lead to higher performance. Little, if
any, research has utilized rigorous designs to test the hypothesis that em-
ploying progressive HRM systems actually results in higher organizational
performance in a causal sense.

The purpose of this study is to provide a more rigorous examination of
the causal order in the HR practice–organizational performance relation-
ship. It uses a unique sample of autonomous business units within the same
company and explores the relationships between HR practices and past,
concurrent, and future measures of operational and ﬁnancial performance.

A Causal Examination of the HR–Performance Relationship

For researchers to better explore the relationship between HR prac-
tices and proﬁtability, they ﬁrst must consider the conditions necessary for
making valid causal inferences. These conditions have been thoroughly
examined within the philosophy of science literature, yet little of that dis-
cussion has been integrated into the literature on the relationship between
HR practices and ﬁrm performance. We address this below.


PATRICK M. WRIGHT ET AL.

Conditions for Inferring Cause

Cook and Campbell (1979) provide an in-depth analysis of how
philosophers of science have approached the issue of demonstrating a
causal relationship. Based on the work of John Stuart Mill, they propose
three criteria for inferring cause: covariation between the presumed cause
and effect, the temporal precedence of the cause, and the ability to con-
trol or rule out alternative explanations for a possible cause-and-effect
connection.

With regard to covariation, they suggest that demonstrating cause re-
quires that the effect be present when the cause is present and be absent
when the cause is absent. Temporal precedence requires that, at the level
of molar relationships, the proposed cause must exist in time prior to the
proposed outcome. Finally, although not always possible, they suggest a
need to control for all other variables that might cause the focal outcome.
Although such conditions do not necessarily “prove” cause, they provide
a basis for drawing more valid causal inferences.

Importantly, Cook and Campbell (1979) note that the ability to in-
fer causal connections is instrumental for human decision making. They
suggested that the most interesting causal relationships are those where
decision makers exert some control over the putative cause. In such sit-
uations, they can manipulate the putative cause in order to inﬂuence the
proposed outcome. This ﬁts quite nicely with the basic assumption and
goal of the research on the HR–performance relationship. This stream of
research seeks to demonstrate a relationship between HR practices and
performance in an effort to provide decision makers with the causal infer-
ences necessary to justify developing and implementing these practices
in order to increase performance. Consequently, this vein of research, to
fulﬁll its ultimate goal, must provide research that maximizes the validity
of the proposed causal inferences.

Research on the HR–Performance Causal Relationship

Acquiring data that enables researchers to validly infer cause is dif-
ﬁcult in any arena but even more so in research on the HR–performance
relationship. Such research requires studying organizations that are sub-
ject to a tremendous variety of variables that inﬂuence performance. The
research almost universally relies on survey or interview methodologies
to assess the HR practices that exist at a given time. It is important to
note that research built predominantly around survey methodologies can
never match the ability to demonstrate both temporal precedence and con-
trol of alternative explanations that exist in laboratory experiments. So,
we do not suggest that any survey design can ultimately “prove” cause in


412

either direction. However, we do believe that existing research, although
consistently demonstrating covariation, has paid inadequate attention to
temporal precedence and/or alternative explanations.

In order to examine the extent to which this literature has addressed
causality issues, we conducted a literature review identifying 681 empiri-
cal studies examining the relationship between multiple HR practices and
performance. These studies were gathered via literature search as well as
examining studies for cross referencing. We included only studies that
reported empirical relationships between a system of HR practices (we
excluded studies examining a single practice) and organization-level per-
formance measures. We classiﬁed each study in terms of the type of design
(discussed below), whether or not a signiﬁcant relationship was supported,
and whether or not the study empirically tested for reverse causality. It is
important to note that some studies reported data from multiple designs,
so there are actually more designs (70) than studies (66). Table 1 displays
these results (the full reference information for the studies is available in
the appendix). The ﬁrst thing notable about this table is that all of the pub-
lished studies have reported at least one signiﬁcant relationship between
HR practices and performance.

The second notable observation from this table is the vast reliance on
one kind of design. By far the most prevalent design within the litera-
ture examining the HR–performance relationship is what we call “post-
predictive” because it measures HR practices after the performance period,
resulting in actually predicting past performance. Many of these designs
entail a single data collection effort where the same respondent provides
information for both assessments of their current HR practices and their
ﬁrms’ performance. For instance, Delaney and Huselid (1996) used data on
both HR practices and performance collected via phone interviews. Inter-
estingly, such designs ask respondents for their ﬁrm’s current HR practices
but measure their past performance (i.e., performance up until the point
of the response) presenting a logical inconsistency for arguing that HR
practices cause performance. Other studies using this design gather HR
practices via survey during 1 year but use the previous year’s performance
metrics (e.g., Black and Lynch, [2001] use HR practice data gathered in
1994 to predict performance during the 1987–1993 time period). Regard-
less, in both cases the performance occurs prior to the assessment of HR
practices.

A second type of design is referred to as “retrospective” because
it asks respondents to recall HR practices that existed prior to the

1Of the 68 studies, two were impossible to classify because they did not provide sufﬁcient
detail regarding the timing of the measures. Consequently, Table 1 only includes 66 studies,
the designs of which could be coded.

Note. All of the above studies reported at least one signiﬁcant relationship between HR

practices and performance.

performance period. For instance, Ichniowski, Shaw, and Prennushi (1997)
used monthly performance data from steel-ﬁnishing lines over a 5-year
period. However, they measured HR practices by asking respondents af-
ter the 5-year production period to recall what the HR systems were
in place at monthly intervals during the 5-year time frame. Similarly,
Guthrie (2001) used performance data from 1996/97 but asked respon-
dents during that time to report the practices that existed during 1995/96.
Despite the popularity of retrospective reports, there are a number of
problems associated with informant fallibility that can strongly inﬂuence
these reports. The primary problem is that key informants may not be
able to accurately recall sets of HR practices used in years past. As a
number of organizational researchers have suggested, inaccurate recall
in retrospective reporting can result from inappropriate rationalizations,


PATRICK M. WRIGHT ET AL.

415

oversimpliﬁcations, faulty post hoc attributions, and simple lapses of mem-
ory (Golden, 1992; Huber & Power, 1985). Given the potential problems
noted by others (Gerhart, Wright, McMahan, & Snell, 2000; Wright et
al., 2001) with regard to unreliability of single rater reports of HR prac-
tices compounded with the memory requirements to report practices that
existed from 1 to 5 years in the past, such retrospective designs preclude
drawing conﬁdent causal conclusions (Martell & Guzzo, 1991)

Third, other studies have gathered contemporaneous HR practice and
performance data, and we refer to these studies as being “contempora-
neous.” For instance, Delery and Doty (1996) gathered HR practice data
during 1992 and used the year-end performance data. Because the year-
end data includes performance from months prior to and concurrent with
the HR practice measure, it is difﬁcult to draw ﬁrm causal conclusions
using this methodology.

Finally, only a few studies have explored if practices assessed at one
point in time were related to subsequent ﬁrm performance. Such designs
are the only true “predictive” designs. Huselid (1995) gathered both con-
temporaneous and subsequent year performance data and reported only
the subsequent year data in his study in order to provide more conser-
vative effect size estimates. Youndt et al. (1996) related HR practices to
plant performance assessed 2 years later. Youndt and Snell (1995) also
related their assessments of HR practices to performance assessed 3 years
later.

As can be seen in Table 1, the vast preponderance (50 of the 70 designs)
of studies have used a “post-predictive” design. This is not surprising given
the relative ease of data collection, but it does make one wonder how such
studies can legitimately suggest that HR practices “cause” performance.
Six of the studies have used a retrospective design, and an additional four
used a contemporaneous design. The strongest design for actually arguing
a causal relationship, the predictive, has been used in only 10 studies.

Finally, as can be seen in Table 1, very few studies to date have at-
tempted to test whether ﬁrm performance predicts future HR practices or
vice versa. A study conducted by the consulting ﬁrm Watson Wyatt (2002)
(not included in the table because it was not refereed) used data on 51 cor-
porations with HR practice and ﬁnancial performance scores for 1999 and
2001. They found that the 1999 HR practices correlated .41 with 2001
ﬁnancial performance, but 1999 ﬁnancial performance correlated only .19
with 2001 HR practices, thereby concluding that this demonstrated that
HR practices were “leading indicators” of future ﬁnancial performance.
In one of the most extensive efforts to examine causal order, Huselid
and Becker (1996) compared cross-sectional and panel estimates to de-
termine the direction in which the causal arrow pointed. They found
that longitudinal estimates were substantially smaller than cross-sectional


416

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

estimates and, when using the most appropriate statistical analyses, non-
signiﬁcant. However, they found that after making the necessary statis-
tical corrections for measurement error, the data seemed to indicate that
previous HR practices predicted future corporate ﬁnancial performance. In
addition, as Gerhart (2004) notes, using ﬁxed effects estimates can result in
lower effect sizes than cross-sectional estimates because of measurement
error problems. Although Huselid and Becker corrected for unreliability
in their ﬁxed effects estimates, they did not correct for unreliability in the
cross-sectional estimates. Upon doing so, Gerhart found that the cross-
sectional coefﬁcient (.24) was nearly twice as large as the comparable
ﬁxed effects coefﬁcient of .125, suggesting that there may be an omitted
variables problem.

More recently, Guest, Michie, Conway, and Sheehan (2003) related
HR practices to both past and subsequent objective productivity and prof-
itability data as well as current subjective productivity and ﬁnancial per-
formance estimates among a sample of 366 companies in the UK. They
found that HR practices were related to higher proﬁtability but not produc-
tivity using the objective performance measures, but that after controlling
for past performance, the signiﬁcant relationship with proﬁtability disap-
peared. They concluded that their results conﬁrm an association between
HRM and performance, but failed to demonstrate that HR causes higher
performance.

So, in summary, the literature on the HR performance relationship has
(a) universally reported signiﬁcant relationships between HR and perfor-
mance, (b) almost exclusively used designs that do not logically allow
one to draw causal conclusions, and (c) very seldom actually tested for a
reverse causal order.

Research on the Attitude–Performance Causal Relationship

The notion of causality is not limited to the HR–performance relation-
ship. Recent research on the relationship between affective variables such
as employee engagement, job satisfaction, or organizational commitment
and performance at the business unit level of analysis provides interesting
insights and additional evidence that the directionality of cause may be
suspect.

For instance, Ryan, Schmidt, and Johnson (1996) examined the
relationship between unit employee satisfaction and a number of
organizational performance measures with branches of a ﬁnancial ser-
vice organization. Although they found that employee satisfaction was
related to employee turnover, customer satisfaction, and a 60-day delin-
quency rate within each of successive years, they unexpectedly found that


PATRICK M. WRIGHT ET AL.

417

customer satisfaction in Year 1 predicted employee satisfaction in Year 2,
but not vice versa.

More recently, Koys (2001) examined the relationship between the HR
outcomes of employee satisfaction, employee turnover, and citizenship be-
havior and organizational outcomes of proﬁts and customer satisfaction
among 28 branches of a restaurant chain. He found that the HR outcomes
in 1 year more strongly predicted the organizational outcomes in the fol-
lowing year than the organizational outcomes in 1 year predicted the HR
outcomes in the following year.

In a signiﬁcant meta-analysis of the attitude–performance relationship,
Harter, Schmidt, and Hayes (2002) examined the relationship between
employee satisfaction–engagement and business unit outcomes such as
customer satisfaction, productivity, proﬁt, employee turnover and acci-
dents. Their results showed a consistent set of strong relationships with all
these outcomes. They concluded that changes in management practices
that increase employee satisfaction may increase business unit outcomes.
Although they did not speciﬁcally test for the causal direction, they noted
that some of the studies used predictive designs and acknowledged that
future research should continue to focus on causality and directionality
issues.

In a more pessimistic study, Schneider, Hanges, Smith, and Salvaggio
(2003) used job satisfaction data from a consortium of companies gath-
ered over a set of 8 years. They gathered ﬁnancial performance information
(ROA and EPS) over the same period of time in order to assess the causal
direction. Using multiple time lags (1-year, 2-year, etc.) they found sig-
niﬁcant and stable relationships for three of the seven scales. However,
their results indicated that Overall Job Satisfaction and Satisfaction with
Security were more strongly predicted by past performance (using both
ROA and EPS) than vice versa, and that the third scale, Satisfaction with
Pay, exhibited a reciprocal relationship with the performance measures.

Finally, Fulmer, Gerhart, and Scott (2003) examined whether the
“100 Best Companies to Work For” are actually better performers. These
authors based their analysis on the idea that having a superior employee
relations climate would result in higher motivation and productivity, and
reduced turnover that would translate into ﬁnancial performance. In an
extremely creative study, they examined differences between a set of
the 1998 100 Best and (a) a matched set of peer companies from each
member’s industry, and (b) a Value Weighted Index of ﬁrms from the
NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ stock listings over a 6-year time frame includ-
ing 3 years prior to the announcement of their status on the list and the
3 years following. We should note that our categorization would actually
suggest that although the authors were correct in deﬁning these years prior
to and following the announcement (the list came out on January 12, 1998)


418

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

the actual employee satisfaction data was gathered during the prior year
(1997), making results with regard to that year really a “concurrent” study.
Nonetheless, this study provides some evidence of the potential for a re-
verse causal direction. Although they did ﬁnd that the 100 Best companies
outperformed their comparison groups on most of the dependent variables
in 1997 and 1998, on at least one variable (annual return to shareholders,
1996, Table 3) they also outperformed their competitors. In addition, al-
though problematic because it included the 1997 year, which was actually
concurrent with the data collection, the 100 Best companies outperformed
their comparison groups on the cumulative returns from 1995 to 1997.
Thus, although it is clear, as the authors note, that investing in these 100
Best companies would provide a higher return than investing in the com-
parison companies, this might have been true even before they were noted
for their strong employee relations climate.

These studies indicate that signiﬁcant uncertainty exists as to the extent
to which attitudes at the unit level impact unit performance, unit perfor-
mance impact attitudes, or the relationship exhibits dual causality. This
suggests the need for further research because, as Harter et al. (2002) sug-
gest, “The most convincing causal evidence comes not from one study
but from a body of research and a multitude of types of evidence. . .”
(p. 276).

Summary

As can be seen by this detailed analysis of the designs, some of the
seminal studies in the HR-performance literature fail to provide predictive
designs that allow drawing more conﬁdent causal inferences. In addition,
the studies that speciﬁcally set out to address the causal nature of the rela-
tionship have provided, at best, somewhat mixed results. Finally, studies
examining the causal order in the employee attitude (those expected to
be strongly impacted by HR practices) and organizational outcomes have
also produced mixed results. This may not be problematic if no valid al-
ternative explanations for the relationship have been proposed. However,
a number of alternative causal models have been proposed.

Alternative Causal Models for the HR–Performance Relationship

Universally assumed in the HR-performance literature is a causal
model wherein HR practices, when implemented effectively, result in
higher organizational performance. However, Wright and Gardner (2003)
offered three alternative explanations for the observed covariation between
HR practices and ﬁrm performance.


PATRICK M. WRIGHT ET AL.

419

First, “reverse causation” would suggest that, rather than HR prac-
tices causing performance, performance causes HR practices. This model
suggests that high-performing organizations by their nature possess slack
resources. Firms that are proﬁtable may share these proﬁts with employees
in a number of ways. They may provide higher pay and beneﬁts, may in-
vest in offering more training and development opportunities, may develop
more extensive selection systems, and may allow employees to participate
in teams, quality circles, and other forms of empowerment activities. In
fact, a number of the HR practice items more logically demonstrate a re-
verse causation effect. Items such as the percentage of total pay that is
variable, the differences in percent merit increases between high and low
performers, and the number of hours of training received are heavily inﬂu-
enced by the past and current ﬁnancial performance of a ﬁrm. Firms facing
ﬁnancial difﬁculties reduce their variable pay (proﬁt sharing and stock op-
tions have little or no value; Hewitt Associates, 2001; Kennedy, 2003),
merit increases (and thus the difference between high and low performers;
Kennedy, 2003), and training budgets (reduce the number of hours they
train employees; Exclusive RSS Survey, 2003; McIntyre, 1992).

Consequently, studies that do not attempt to assess temporal prece-
dence (through using a predictive design that uses a performance mea-
sure collected following the HR practice measure) may not provide the
data necessary for making valid causal inferences. Even studies that are
predictive in design may still not allow complete conﬁdence in drawing
causal conclusions. As Huselid and Becker (1996) showed, if ﬁnancial
performance also predicts HR practices, then both predictive designs, or
designs that examine cross-lagged correlations (such as the Watson Wyatt
study), may show relationships between past HR practices and future ﬁrm
performance, without truly proving that it is the HR practices leading to
performance, rather than vice versa.

Second, a “spurious” relationship might exist if there were an actual
true covariation between the measures of HR practices and performance,
yet, there was no direct causal relationship between the two variables. In
this case, it may be that a third variable is causing both variables result-
ing in their respective covariation. For instance, it could be that effective
leaders cause organizational performance, and they also treat employees
well through progressive HR practices. A number of texts have argued for
the positive effects of leadership on organizational performance (Conger
& Kanungo, 1988; Day & Lord, 1988; Kouzes & Posner, 1995). These
texts argue that leadership contributes toward deﬁning strategic direction,
integrating various job activities, coordinating communication between
organizational subunits, monitoring activities, and controlling deviations
from standard. These activities are likely to directly effect performance as
well as deﬁne organizational HR practices.


420

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Organizational culture may be another third variable that causes both
the implementation of “high performance” HR practices and organiza-
tional performance. Organizational culture is a system of shared values
(what is important) and beliefs (how things work) that shape a company’s
people, organizational structures, and control system to produce behavioral
norms (the way we do things around here; Schein, 1985). An organiza-
tion’s culture is likely to be related to both its management practices as well
as organizational performance. A number of texts have in fact argued for
positive effects of organizational culture on organizational performance
(Barney, 1986; Collins & Porras, 1994; Kotter & Heskett, 1992; Siehl
& Martin, 1990). Although some researchers have argued that HR prac-
tices shape organizational culture as part of the HR practice–ﬁrm perfor-
mance causal chain (Kopelman, Brief, & Guzzo, 1990; Ostroff & Bowen,
2000), it is just as possible that culture actually inﬂuences which types of
HR practices are put in place in an organization as well as how they are
implemented.

One of the very ﬁrst published HR–performance articles supports the
notion of a third spurious variable driving HR practices and ﬁrm perfor-
mance (Krackhardt, McKenaa, Porter, & Steers, 1981). Using 50 branches
of a single commercial bank, the researchers trained managers in half the
branches to improve communications with tellers, set up cross-training,
and reward top performers; managers in the matched sample received no
such training. The main ﬁndings suggested that the experimental group
had lower turnover than the control group. Post hoc analyses revealed
that some of the managers in the experimental branches implemented the
management practices and some did not. Managers in historically high-
performing branches were more likely to implement the practices than
those in historically low-performing branches. Although clearly not a
true test of the spurious variable hypothesis, these ﬁndings suggest an
unmeasured attribute of the bank branches concurrently drove perfor-
mance, use of HR practices, and employee turnover (Krackhardt et al.,
1981). Studies that do not control for a full set of variables that might
cause performance may lack the data necessary for making valid causal
inferences.

Finally, “implicit performance theories” might suggest that there may
be no true relationship between HR practices and performance, but one
may be observed empirically due to respondents’ implicit performance
theories. This explanation suggests that the information processing re-
quirements for respondents to know and report all HR practices across all
jobs across all units, across the globe are too great, and consequently, they
respond to the HR practice measure based on their knowledge of the ﬁrm’s
performance (i.e., “we’re a high performing ﬁrm so we must do all these
HR things”). In fact, a study by Gardner and Wright (2002) presented

executives and graduate students with ﬁctitious descriptions of high- and
low-performing companies and found evidence that their reports of HR
practices can be inﬂuenced by knowledge of the company’s past perfor-
mance. Thus, studies gathering concurrent HR practice and performance
(or retrospective HR) data, particularly if both measures come from the
same respondent, may have HR practice measures that are contaminated
by respondents’ implicit performance theories.

This discussion is not to suggest that any one study can adequately
address all of the conditions necessary for drawing causal conclusions. It
does, however, point to the fact that the current research base does not
provide the data necessary for drawing causal conclusions implicitly or
explicitly driving current research and practice.

This study will attempt to address at least some of these issues with
regard to drawing valid causal conclusions regarding the relationship be-
tween HR practices and ﬁrm performance. First, it uses a number of vari-
ables that comprise a logical chain through which we expect that HR
practices will impact proﬁtability, including human resource (affective or-
ganizational commitment), operational (productivity, quality, shrinkage,
and workers compensation), and ﬁnancial (expenses and proﬁts) perfor-
mance measures. Second, the performance data are collected over time,
allowing us to explore the relative relationships between our focal vari-
ables (HR and affective organizational commitment) and the performance
variables assessed prior to, concurrent with, and following the assess-
ment of these focal variables. Finally, although it does not control for
all potential alternative causes of the performance variables, the unique
sample of autonomous business units within the same company control
for a number of extraneous variables (industry, product lines, revenues,
number of employees, etc.) that are often difﬁcult to control in other
studies.

The design of our study is illustrated in Figure 1. As can be seen, we
test for the relationships between both HR practice and aggregated af-
fective commitment and multiple performance measures at four different
times: past, concurrent, early post, and late post. The performance mea-
sures span both operational (productivity, quality, shrinkage, and workers
compensation) and ﬁnancial (expenses and proﬁts) performance measures.
At the outset we should note that the purpose of this article is not
to argue that HR practices do not have any impact on ﬁrm performance.
Rather, it is to argue that (a) past research does not provide an adequate
basis for inferring cause, and (b) past research may have resulted in inﬂated
estimates of any causal impact that does exist. We hope that the empirical
examination of the causal direction will spur future researchers to conduct
more rigorous empirical investigations that can result in more valid causal
inferences.

Method

Overview

This study consisted of examining the relationships between both HR
practices and collective affective commitment and various operational and
ﬁnancial measures of performance. Survey data collected from multiple
employees per business unit were used to measure HR practices and af-
fective commitment and their covariation with archival measures of pre-
vious, concurrent, and subsequent organizational performance measures
collected at 6-month intervals.

Sample

The sample consisted of 45 self-contained business units (the equiva-
lent of a plant) of a large food service corporation with operations in the
United States and Canada. The data were collected from U.S. employees
over two ﬁscal years (1998–2000), and because a subset (n = 17) of the
business units participated in the survey in both years, there are a total of
62 data points.2 Each of the business units has six basic job categories:

2For each of these 17 cases we treated them as independent observations using the
corresponding past, simultaneous, early post and late post measures. Consequently, the late
post measures for these cases in Year 1 also served as the past measures in Year 2. Because
the 17 business units created the situation where the observations were not all independent,
we reran the analyses with only the 45 independent observations. The results did not differ
signiﬁcantly from those presented here, so in the interest of higher power, we used the full
data set.

sales, warehousing, merchandising, delivery drivers, administrative staff,
and supervisors/managers. Business unit HR directors were instructed to
randomly select and survey 20% or more of the employees in each job
group from each of the three shifts. Employees completed surveys on
company time under the direction of the HR director. Surveys were col-
lected in one large sealable envelope per meeting, which was then sent
to the researchers. The response rate for employees in this meeting was
99.4% for a total employee sample size of 13,005.

Consistent with past research on the HR-performance relationship
(Arthur, 1994; Batt, 2002; Delery & Doty, 1996; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, &
Gupta, 1998), we used the survey responses from employees in core jobs,
deﬁned as nonsupervisory, nonmanagerial workers at the business unit who
are directly involved in providing the service at the location (Osterman,
1994, p. 175). Extensive ﬁeld work at multiple business units along with
conversations with business unit presidents allowed us to conclude that the
core jobs were MA (merchandising associates, i.e., salespersons), ware-
house employees, and delivery drivers. The MAs work with customers to
determine their product needs and place their orders, warehouse employ-
ees acquire the necessary products from the warehouse, and the delivery
drivers deliver these products to the customers.

Thus, each data point in this study was derived from an average of
39.02 MAs, 38.66 warehousers, and 35.00 drivers for a total of
112.68 employees per business unit and a total of 6,986 employees across
the 62 business units. The employee sample included 21.6% of all em-
ployees across all 62 business units. In order to eliminate the possibility of
common method variance (or percept–percept correlations that are biased
by collecting two measures from the same source using the same method at
the same time), we used the reports of HR practices from half the respon-
dents from each organization and the reports of affective organizational
commitment from the other half of the respondents.

This corporation’s management philosophy emphasizing structural
ways to create an entrepreneurial environment presents a unique opportu-
nity to study the relationship between HR and performance in a controlled
ﬁeld setting. First, the corporation tries to keep every business between
$350 million and $700 million in revenues with a corresponding employee
count of between 250 and 600 employees. If a business unit grows beyond
the $700 million mark, it is then divided into two business units. This
creates a sample where size (both in terms of revenues and employees)
is strongly controlled. In addition, the basic products and information
technology are largely uniform across all of the business units. Although
regional differences may result in different volumes and mixes of products,
the products available for sale are uniform. Similarly, although localized


424

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

changes might be made to the information technology, the basic opera-
tional systems are largely uniform. Thus, again the sample largely controls
for performance differences due to products and technology.

However, although size, technology, and products provide little op-
portunity for variance, considerable variance exists with regard to HR
strategies. Guided by the corporate principle of “earned autonomy,” busi-
ness units are largely free to manage their employees however they see ﬁt.
A minimal level of uniformity in HR practices exists with regard to legally
mandated beneﬁts, but the majority of HR practices (e.g., speciﬁc selection
processes and practices, pay systems, performance management systems,
training and development strategies and practices) are left to the business
units to design, develop, and implement. Corporate control over the busi-
ness units comes from monitoring the operational and ﬁnancial results that
we report here. This is analogous to the “ﬁnancial” controls as opposed
to “strategic” controls discussed in the corporate strategy literature (see
Rowe & Wright, 1997). Thus, this sample provides a unique opportunity
to study the HR–performance relationship where many sources of extra-
neous variance are controlled through design (thus negating the need for
statistical controls), but the major focus of variance is with regard to the
phenomenon of interest: HR practices.

Measures

HR practices. Employee respondents in each work unit were asked
whether or not nine speciﬁc HR practices existed for their job category
(“Yes,” “No,” and “I don’t know”). “Yes” responses were coded as 1; “No”
responses were coded as zeros. “I don’t know” responses were classiﬁed
as “No” and coded as zeros. See Table 2 for the complete listing of the
HR practice items used in this study. The choice of the items was based
on a compromise between what the researchers wanted to examine and
what the company was willing to allow to be asked. We were allowed to
add some actual HR practice items to the survey in return for providing a
reduced fee (the company was originally only interested in assessing the
climate), but the company representatives refused to allow us to ask some
questions that they deemed too sensitive in terms of potentially priming
employees to wonder why they did not have these practices (e.g., gain-
sharing, proﬁt sharing, etc.). In the end, we had items that represented the
major areas of HR practices (selection, pay for performance, training, and
participation).

One training item was originally written in a different response format
than the rest of the HR practice items. This item was “On average, how
many hours of formal training do employees in this job receive each year?”

Human Resource Management Practice Questionsa

TABLE 2

Selection

1. Applicants undergo structured interviews (job related questions, same questions

asked of all applicants, rating scales) before being hired.

2. Qualiﬁed employees have the opportunity to be promoted to positions of greater pay

and/or responsibility within the company.

3. Applicants for this job take formal tests (paper and pencil or work sample) before

being hired.

Training

4. On average how many hours of formal training do employees in this job receive each

year?b

Pay for Performance and Performance Evaluation

5. Employees in this job regularly (at least once a year) receive a formal evaluation of

their performance.

6. Pay raises for employees in this job are based on job performance.
7. Employees in this job have the opportunity to earn individual bonuses (or

commissions) for productivity, performance, or other individual performance
outcomes.

Participation

8. Employees in this job are involved in formal participation processes such as quality
improvement groups, problem-solving groups, roundtable discussions, or suggestion
systems.

9. Employees in this job have a reasonable and fair complaint process.

aWith the exception of those marked, the response option for these questions was “Yes,

No, I don’t know.”

bResponse option was “Hours—”

This item was recoded to comply with the yes/no dichotomous response
format of the other practice items. If the number of training hours entered
is equal to or greater than 15, that response was be coded as 1 = yes. Hours
below 15 were coded as 0 = no.3

It should be noted that collecting HR practice data from multiple em-
ployees from each business unit is consistent with recommendations by
Gerhart et al. (2000) and Wright et al. (2001). Collecting HR data from
employees results in the measurement of HR practices in use and not
policies in books. Second, due to information processing demands, HR

conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Frazis, Gittleman, Harrigan, & Joyce, 1998).
Both employers and employees of establishments of this size in the wholesale trade industry
report employee receive 16 to 24 hours of training each year. Fifteen hours is well below
industry averages.

executives are generally unable to accurately describe the HR practices
used to manage employees at multiple locations in multiple job groups.
Individual employees are best able to describe their actual employment
relationships. Finally, collecting data from multiple sources allows the es-
timation of the interrater reliability for both the individual practices and
the index. As reported below, use of this methodology results in highly
reliable measures.

Consistent with previous research, we used an additive index of these
HR practices (e.g., MacDufﬁe, 1995; Youndt et al., 1996). Because there
was no reason to believe that these practices should be conceptualized as
a unidimensional construct (see Delery, 1998), interrater reliability was
deemed to be the most appropriate reliability assessment. Intraclass cor-
relations were computed for this scale at the organizational level. For each
individual, a ratio was calculated of the number practices they stated were
present divided by nine. The business unit index of HR practices was cre-
ated by taking the mean of this ratio for the half of the employees providing
information about this measure. Hofmann (2002) notes that when con-
structs are objective ones that are being assessed by multiple respondents
(such as with HR practices), one is only interested in obtaining a reliable
estimate of the aggregate phenomena. These HR practice measures illus-
trated that using a single respondent (ICC(1), which assesses the reliability
of a single respondent measure) would result in extremely low reliability,
but that by using multiple respondents (ICC(2) which assesses the reli-
ability of using aggregated multiple respondents), the reliability of the
measures is more than adequate (average item ICC(1) = .06, average item
ICC(2) = .77; scale ICC(1) = .13, scale ICC(2) = .89).

Affective organizational commitment. Five items from two different
organizational commitment scales (Meyer & Allen, 1997; Porter, Steers,
Mowday, & Boulin, 1974) were used to construct the collective affective
commitment measure. Sample items include “I feel a strong sense of be-
longing to this organization,” “I am willing to work harder than I have to
in order to help this company succeed,” and “I am proud to be working
for this company.” Items were averaged to create one index per person
and were then aggregated to the business level using half the sample of
employees providing information about commitment. Again, aggregat-
ing over respondents resulted in good reliability (α = .86, ICC(1) = .07,
ICC(2)= .81). The ANOVAs used to calculate the ICCs were signiﬁcant at
the .001 level suggesting a level of agreement about affective commitment
at the business unit to aggregate individual scores into a mean commitment
score.

Performance. Six measures of performance were obtained from
archival company records. These measures represent the major perfor-
mance measures tracked by the corporate headquarters as indicators of

a businesses success.4 “Workers Compensation” was the workers com-
pensation expenses incurred during the 6 months divided by sales; the
lower the number the better. “Quality” was measured as number of pieces
per error where each piece represents a carton of product. “Shrinkage”
was measured as inventory loss including loss due to spoilage, warehouse
outs, inventory adjustments, cycle count adjustments, warehouse dam-
age, delivery shorts, delivery damage, samples shrinkage, and sales return
damage as a percentage of sales. “Productivity” was assessed as payroll
expenses for all employees divided by the number of pieces; the lower
the number the better (i.e., it measures “payroll per piece”). “Operating
Expenses” consisted of all relevant business operating expenses including
warehouse, occupancy, delivery, selling, data processing, and G&A ex-
penses as a percentage of sales. Finally “Proﬁtability” was assessed as the
operating pre tax proﬁt of the business unit as a percentage of sales where
operating pre tax proﬁt was calculated as Sales−(Cost of Goods Sold +
Operating Expenses + Cash Discounts).

Each measure was for a 6-month period and included 9 months to
3 months prior to the survey administration (past), 3 months prior and
3 months after the survey administration (concurrent), 3 to 9 months after
survey administration (early post) and 9 to 15 months after the survey
administration (late post). It is also important to point out that although the
standard deviations for operating expenses, shrinkage, and worker’s comp
are extremely small, their means are also quite small. These performance
measures have a similar dispersion, relative to the mean as the HR index,
collective commitment, and the other performance measures.

Results

The means (at the request of the company all variables were cen-
tered to disguise the raw data), SDs, and intercorrelations are presented in
Table 3.

Although somewhat redundant, Tables 4 (HR practices) and 5 (collec-
tive affective commitment) provide these same relationships in a way that
enables the reader to better understand the causal connections. Columns
1 through 4 display the correlations between the focal variable and each
of the past, concurrent, early post, and late post performance variables.
Columns 5 through 8 show the partial correlations with each of the six
future performance measures (early and late) controlling for the same

4One of the reviewers correctly noted that a number of problems exist with using ratio
measures in regression. The preferred method for controlling for the denominator is by
entering it in to the regression equation rather than computing it as a denominator. However,
the corporation only provided us with data in its already computed ratio form.

measure’s past (Columns 5 and 6) and concurrent (Columns 7 and 8) per-
formance, respectively (e.g., the partial correlation between HR and future
quality performance controlling for past quality performance).

In order to examine the basic relationships depicted in Figure 1, we
ﬁrst report the bivariate correlations using the concurrent measure of col-
lective commitment and the early post performance measures. As can
be seen in Table 3, HR practices correlated highly with concurrent col-
lective affective commitment (r = .57; p < .01). Table 4 (column 3)
shows that the HR index was also appropriately correlated with all but one
of the early post operational performance measures including shrinkage
(r = −.30, p < .05), quality (r = .48, p < .01), and workers compensation
(r = −.43, p < .01). HR practices were unrelated to our measure of early
post productivity (r = −.07, ns). The HR practice index also correlated
signiﬁcantly with early post expenses (r = −.25; p < .05) and proﬁts
(r = .33; p < .01). Similarly, as can be seen in Table 5 (Column 3), af-
fective commitment correlated strongly with the operational performance
measures’ productivity (r = −.23, p < .10), shrinkage (r = −.26, p < .05),
quality (r = .38, p < .01), and workers compensation (r =−.50, p < .01) as
well as expenses (r = −.27; p < .05) and proﬁts (r = .29; p < .05). The re-
sults were similar using the late post measures (Column 4 of both Tables 4
and 5), indicating support for the basic idea that both HR practices and
affective organizational commitment are positively related to measures of
organizational performance.

Although these results show that past HR practices predict future per-
formance, they may be biased (and even misleading) if the causal arrow
points in the opposite direction (e.g., performance is relatively stable and it
causes HR practices). Thus, the next set of analyses examines the compar-
ative relationships using past, concurrent, and post (early and late) mea-
sures. Starting with Table 4, comparing Columns 1 and 2 with Columns 3
and 4 shows that the correlations between HR practices and the perfor-
mance measures vary little over time. The same comparisons in Table 5
display similar results in that the correlations between commitment and
the performance measures vary little over time. On a positive note, this
suggests that the relationships observed in the concurrent studies may
adequately reﬂect what would be observed in predictive studies. On the
negative side, however, these results provide just as much support for the
proposition that performance causes commitment and HR practices as it
does the reverse.

Finally, not surprisingly given the stable correlations discussed previ-
ously, controlling for past or concurrent performance tends to reduce the
relationships drastically, usually to the level of nonsigniﬁcance. Looking
at Table 4 (Columns 3 and 4), 9 of the 12 bivariate correlations between
HR and the two post-performance measures were signiﬁcant. However,
when controlling for the past performance on each of the focal variables


432

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

(Columns 5 and 6), only one correlation remains signiﬁcant, and control-
ling for concurrent performance results in only one signiﬁcant correlation.
Turning to Table 5 (Columns 3 and 4), 8 of the 12 bivariate correlations
between collective affective commitment and the two post-performance
measures were signiﬁcant at the .05 level. However, after controlling for
past performance (Columns 5 and 6), none of the correlations remained
signiﬁcant, and only two correlations remained signiﬁcant when control-
ling for concurrent performance (Columns 7 and 8). These results sug-
gest that the proposition that HR practices cause higher organizational
performance should be, at best, tentative, and great caution should be ex-
ercised in interpreting past HR–performance research that suggests this
relationship.

Discussion

Research on the relationship between HR practices and performance
has provided a ﬁrm foundation from which the next generation of research
can be built. Although models of the process through which HR practices
impact performance have progressed, they have not been tested empiri-
cally. In addition, research has not attended to the methodological rigor
necessary to suggest causality. Consequently, the existing research base
does not provide as ﬁrm a foundation for drawing valid causal inferences.
This study suggests that such causal inferences should be drawn with
extreme caution.

The basic causal model positing that HR practices impact collective
commitment, operational performance, expenses, and proﬁts was sup-
ported in a predictive sense. HR practices correlated strongly, positively,
and most often signiﬁcantly with operational and ﬁnancial measures ob-
served later (both early and late). Taken alone, these results would provide
more support for the notion that implementing progressive HR practices
will result in improved operating and ﬁnancial performance (Becker &
Huselid, 1998; Dyer & Reeves, 1995).

However, when comparing these relationships with those between HR
practices and past or concurrent performance, caution ﬂags arise. The
relative consistency across all these time periods suggests that the causal
order could just as easily be reversed. These results essentially mirror
those of Guest et al. (2003) who found that in some cases, the correlations
with past performance exceeded those with future performance. Certainly
they point to the fact that even predictive studies that simply explore the
relationship with future performance may be misleading.

Finally, the drastic reduction in observed relationships that occurs when
controlling for past or concurrent performance provides further impetus
for exercising extreme caution in inferring a direct causal impact of HR

433

on performance. Among the signiﬁcant correlations (i.e., those that would
lead to the conclusion that HR causes performance) from Table 3 (HR–
performance) and Table 4 (OC–performance), considerable reductions oc-
cur. Speciﬁcally, when using the early post measure, the average signiﬁcant
correlation is .36, which is reduced by 23 and 24 correlation points when
controlling for past and simultaneous performance, respectively. Using the
late post, the average signiﬁcant correlation of .34 is reduced by 18 and
23 points, respectively. In Table 4, when using the early post-performance
measures, the average signiﬁcant correlation of .34 is reduced by 22 and 21
points when controlling for past and simultaneous performance, respec-
tively. Using the late post-performance measures, the average signiﬁcant
correlation of .37 is reduced by 21 and 22 points, respectively. Again, this
coincides with Guest et al.’s (2003) research demonstrating the drastic
reduction to nonsigniﬁcance of the effects of HR on performance once
past performance has been controlled. Again, these results spark cautious
interpretation among even predictive studies.

By no means do these results suggest that HR practices do not have a
positive impact on performance. Neither do they provide any more support
for concluding that performance causes HR practices than they do for
concluding that HR practices cause performance. They do, however, raise
interesting questions regarding the true causal relationship between HR
practices and performance. This leads us to speculate on some potential
explanations for ﬁndings such as ours and Guest et al.’s (2003).

One possibility is that the data observed here, relatively consistent pos-
itive relationships over time, may indicate a nonrecursive model. Such a
model suggests dual causation; business units that perform well, invest
more in HR practices, and this investment pays off in increased perfor-
mance. If this is the case, then it does not negate the value in implementing
progressive HR practices, but it does suggest that the observed payoff may
be far less than the estimates provided in past research (e.g., Huselid, 1995;
Huselid & Becker, 1996, 2000).

A second explanation for these results may be that the relationship
is spurious, with both HR and performance variables being caused by
some third variable. For instance, it may be that, as previously discussed,
the business units with effective leaders (presidents) both treat people
well (through the HR practices) and drive higher business performance.
For example, in addition to assessing HR practices, Huselid and Becker
(1997) captured a measure of “other management effectiveness” (i.e., a
one-item measure “Excluding the HR function, how would you rate the
other functional areas within your ﬁrm [e.g. ﬁnance, marketing, produc-
tion, etc.] relative to those same functions in your direct competitors?”)
This measure correlated .30 with performance and .25 with the HR systems
measure. Partialling out this crude measure from the HR–performance


434

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

relationship reduces the observed correlation from .25 to .18, indicating at
least some evidence for the possibility of a spurious relationship. Or, for
instance, recently many corporations have sought to build “high perfor-
mance” cultures (Wright, Snell, & Jacobsen, 2004). Such a culture seeks to
both engage employees emotionally to the ﬁrm and to encourage them to
maximize their performance. Because such cultures are sought to be built
in part by aligning the HR systems, one cannot easily tease out whether
both HR practices and performance emanate from the culture or the culture
and performance emanate from the HR practices.

Third, one could hypothesize that the observed relationships result
from the temporal stability of both sets of variables. For instance, HR
practices tend to be intractable and very difﬁcult to change (Gerhart &
Milkovich, 1990; Snell & Dean, 1994). Thus, when measuring HR prac-
tices at one point in time, one is likely capturing the practices that have
existed for a number of years. If, in fact, these practices do result in higher
performance, then the measure at one point in time would still be strongly
related to both past and future performance. In this case, our “past” perfor-
mance measure may actually be a “post”-performance measure because
though our measure was taken after the performance measure, the prac-
tices were implemented prior to the performance measure. In addition, the
performance measures are quite stable over time. The correlations across
the four time periods ranged from .67 to .95 for proﬁtability, .87 to .97 for
expenses, .59 to .93 for shrinkage, .85 to .96 for productivity, .64 to .92
for quality, and .51 to .86 for workers compensation. Consequently, past
research using post-predictive or concurrent designs may display similar
results to predictive designs.

However, interestingly, the results do not seem to differ whether using
the HR practices measure (assumed to be extremely stable) or the commit-
ment measure (assumed to be a bit more variable over time). Our results
indicated that the correlations between commitment and the various per-
formance measures are almost invariant over time and that they became
nonsigniﬁcant when controlling for past or concurrent performance. This
differs somewhat from the results of Koys (2001) who found that employee
satisfaction in Year 1 was more strongly related to proﬁts in Year 2 than the
reverse. However, he did ﬁnd that when controlling for other HR outcomes
in one equation, and for those outcomes and past performance in another
equation, employee satisfaction did not predict proﬁts. Again, if HR prac-
tices strongly inﬂuence commitment, and the practices have existed for
considerable time, there should also be some stable variance in commit-
ment. However, we note simply that our results seem to show suspicion
in drawing causal order conclusions whether using a stable HR predic-
tor measure (practices) or a more variable predictor (commitment), and
also seem to be consistent using both operational (shrinkage, productivity,


PATRICK M. WRIGHT ET AL.

435

quality, workers compensation costs) and ﬁnancial (expenses, proﬁt) mea-
sures of performance.

An additional ﬁnding stemmed from a question raised by one of the
reviewers regarding differences in variance in HR practices at different
performance levels. In an exploratory analysis, we divided the ﬁrms into
quartiles on each of the 24 performance measures (6 measures at 4 differ-
ent times) and examined the standard deviations for each of the quartiles.
Surprisingly, we found that greater variance existed in HR practices at
the bottom quartiles than at the top quartiles. This seems to indicate two
things. First, high-performing companies seem to almost universally use
a high level of HR practices (a high mean and low SD). However, hav-
ing a high level of HR practices does not ensure high performance. The
low-performing companies, although having a low mean, also had a high
SD, indicating that some of them must have been engaging in a signiﬁcant
number of the HR practices we assessed. This leads to the second impli-
cation, that perhaps something is moderating the relationship between HR
practices and performance. In other words, it seems that low HR practices
are associated with low performance, but high HR may only be associated
with high performance under certain conditions. Again, this may lead to
the potential missing variable discussed above. Perhaps effective leaders
or high performance cultures that are supported by HR practices tend to
exhibit high performance, but simply transplanting a set of HR practices
into a low performance culture or under an ineffective leader may not have
the intended effect.

These results also suggest some interesting implications for future re-
search. Future research should focus on study designs that are better able
to demonstrate the causal order to show that HR practices, when imple-
mented correctly, can positively generate higher ﬁrm performance. At a
minimum, this calls for focusing on gathering data at multiple points in
time as was done in both this study and the Huselid and Becker (1996)
study. Our current sample of business units with data at both points
(n = 17) is too small for providing any stable results. However, we con-
tinue to conduct the climate survey, the number of participating business
units continues to grow, and the company continues to provide the per-
formance data. Thus, we are hopeful that future waves of data collection
will provide an ability to examine how units that actually change their HR
practices experience corresponding performance changes.

Another approach to teasing out the causal direction in the HR–ﬁrm
performance relationship may be the use of quasi-experimental designs.
Cook and Campbell (1979) discuss how quasi-experimentation can pro-
vide data that enable researchers to more conﬁdently draw causal conclu-
sions. For instance, the company we studied uses the climate data in part
to persuade business leaders to implement better HR practices. One could


436

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

identify companies that have gone through drastic changes in their HR
practices and match them with companies who did not change their prac-
tices. These two samples could then be compared with regard to their
subsequent performance. Although such designs do not prove causation,
they can enable researchers to better understand the causal nature of the
relationship between HR practices and ﬁrm performance.

Limitations

A few limitations must be considered in interpreting these results.
First, the time frame used for the study (i.e., 3–9 months prior to and
9–15 months following the measure of HR) may have been too short to
fully capture causal effects. Although this is one of only a few studies
that have actually examined how measures of HR practices relate to past
performance, the time lag between the previous performance measure and
the measure of HR was not great (3–9 months). Certainly, it is possible that
the practices reported were likely in place during the timeframe compris-
ing this past performance measure. In addition, the effects of HR practices
may take longer and/or aggregate over longer time periods (i.e., longer than
9–15 months) after their implementation. However, this illustrates the po-
tential vacuousness of cross-sectional or even lagged studies that examine
the impact of HR practices on performance. The cross-sectional relation-
ship may exist, but there is no way of knowing the causal direction. Thus,
although the short lag does not prove reverse causation, it certainly demon-
strates that empirically, this is just as likely as the oft-hypothesized causal
order. This argues for future research that both uses longer time periods
of study and assesses performance variables after actual changes in HR
practices.

Second, because the study was conducted within one organization, one
could question the generalizability of the results. We note that generaliz-
ability is not the goal of all research. Some research, such as this, is aimed
primarily at testing theoretical predictions rather than trying to develop
generalizable empirical results. What our study demonstrates is that in
a cross-sectional study ﬁnding a relationship between HR practices and
performance, the results could also support a reverse causation or recipro-
cal causation explanation. Again, the goal is not to conclude that reverse
causation explains all past research, nor to argue that HR practices do not
impact performance, but simply to provide results that spur researchers
to be more creative in the design of research in this area. Better future
research designs will provide more conclusive evidence of the true causal
order.

Third, we must recognize the potential for an unmeasured variables
problem. Although the single corporation/multiple business unit design


PATRICK M. WRIGHT ET AL.

437

allows real controls over a number of variables, because these business
units are geographically distinct, it may be that local labor markets and
economic conditions might vary considerably across the companies. In-
terestingly, however, if one explores how that might play out, the most
likely effect would be to support the reverse causation effect. For instance,
if it is the local markets that greatly impact proﬁtability (e.g., markets
with higher socioeconomic conditions result in those companies having
naturally higher proﬁts), then any unmeasured variable effect (i.e., the
relationship between HR and performance is due to this variable) would
require that these companies use their excess proﬁts to build HR systems.
One would be hard pressed to hypothesize that companies investing in HR
practices produces greater geographical socioeconomic conditions.

Fourth, we must recognize the limited number of HR practices that
went into our HR practice measure. We assessed practices representing the
major functional areas (stafﬁng, training, appraisal, pay for performance,
and participation) but only had nine practices assessed as opposed to other
studies that have assessed a broader set of practices.

Finally, we must note that we did not attempt to test any complex me-
diational model (i.e., the impact of HR on performance is through commit-
ment). We have tested this model with a subset of the data presented here
(Wright, Gardner, & Moynihan, 2003) and found support for the media-
tion. However, the purpose of this study was to examine methodological, as
opposed to theoretical issues in this vein of research. Because questions of
causality have been raised regarding both the HR practices–performance
and job attitudes–performance relationships, focusing speciﬁcally on these
relationships allowed a more focused test of the research questions.

Conclusion

Past research has provided extensive data on the positive relation-
ship between HR practices and organizational performance in an effort to
demonstrate a positive impact of HR practices. This study has attempted
to both explicate the issues with regard to drawing causal conclusions
within this vein of research and to provide empirical data to explore some
of these issues. The study demonstrates that HR practices are strongly
related to future performance but that they are also strongly related to past
performance, suggesting caution among both academics and practitioners
in making any causal inferences. Although one could accurately interpret
our results as showing HR practices to be part of a “high-performance”
organization, they certainly do not provide proof that these practices cause
that high performance. Consequently, our study points to the need to de-
sign and conduct studies that are better able to examine the extent to which
implementing progressive HR practices will result in improved operating

and ﬁnancial performance. Such research will provide for decision makers
a more convincing business case for the need to properly manage human
resources.
