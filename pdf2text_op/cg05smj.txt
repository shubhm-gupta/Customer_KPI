We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs’ salaries, bonuses, stock options,
and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder
management and ﬁnancial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database
of 406 Fortune 1000 ﬁrms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards
of directors when setting CEO compensation. Speciﬁcally, we found a signiﬁcant, negative
main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder
management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of ﬁnancial
performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth
by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CEO compensation is one of the most widely
researched areas in management. Much of this
research has focused on determining whether and
to what extent CEOs are rewarded for superior
organizational performance. Despite this work,
empirical support for this relationship has been
mixed.
In a recent CEO compensation meta-
analysis, Tosi et al. (2000) reported that ﬁnancial
performance accounted for approximately 5 per-
cent of the variance in CEO compensation, with
ﬁrm size exerting a much larger inﬂuence. As
Gomez-Mejia notes: ‘The literature on executive
pay is rather extensive . . . However . . . it is amaz-
ing how little we know about executive pay in spite
of the massive volume of empirical work available
on this topic’ (Gomez-Mejia, 1994: 199). One pos-
sible reason for the difﬁculty in ﬁnding a consistent
link between organizational performance and CEO

compensation may be the ﬁeld’s almost exclusive
focus on ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance.

Several calls have been made for researchers to
go beyond ﬁnancial performance and to include
additional organizational effectiveness measures
when studying strategic management (see Came-
ron, 1986; Hillman, Keim, and Luce, 2001).
One such measure of organizational effectiveness,
stakeholder management (SM), has been explored
as a possible outcome of CEO compensation
structure (McGuire, Dow, and Argheyd, 2003), but
it has been ignored as a possible antecedent. SM
deals with the degree to which organizations move
beyond their own needs and legal requirements
(McWilliams and Siegel, 2001) to satisfy the needs
of
their various non-shareholding stakeholders
such as employees, suppliers, customers, and
individuals in the community whose primary
beneﬁt derived from the company is not from
its shareholder
returns. We are aware of no
studies that have examined the extent to which
top executives are compensated for leading their
ﬁrms to higher levels of SM. Thus, the extent to

which CEOs are rewarded for pursuing stakeholder
management
an empirical
question. Our goal, then, is to advance the ﬁeld of
strategic management by developing the argument
that SM is likely to affect CEO compensation, both
as a main effect and as an interaction effect with
ﬁnancial performance. We empirically test these
relationships using a sample of 406 Fortune 1000
ﬁrms and their CEOs.

LITERATURE REVIEW AND
HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT

Prior CEO compensation research has relied im-
plicitly or explicitly on agency theory to frame
discussions and empirical tests (Tosi and Gomez-
Mejia, 1989). The most essential agency the-
ory component is the principal–agent relationship,
whereby the agent (in this case the CEO) con-
ducts business on behalf of the organization’s prin-
cipals (the owners/shareholders). Principals often
ﬁnd it difﬁcult and expensive to monitor agents’
actions, resulting in agency-related costs. Agency
theory suggests that compensation should be tied
to ﬁnancial performance so that agents are encour-
aged to simultaneously maximize ﬁnancial perfor-
mance and their own wealth (Stroh et al., 1996).
In the absence of such a compensation structure,
executives may favor strategic actions designed to
increase ﬁrm size and the CEO’s own ﬁnancial
rewards, potentially at the cost of proﬁtability and
shareholder wealth (Baumol, 1967). When CEO
compensation is related to ﬁnancial performance,
agency costs are minimized.

Results from examinations of the ﬁrm perfor-
mance–CEO compensation relationship are sur-
prisingly inconsistent with regard to the strength
of the relationship. As Tosi et al. (2000) noted, the
correlations between ﬁrm performance and CEO
compensation in prior research have ranged from
0.41 (Belliveau, O’Reilly, and Wade, 1996) to
−0.03 (Finkelstein and Boyd, 1998). Therefore,
prior research has found that CEO compensation
does not always depend on the extent to which
CEOs guide their ﬁrms to superior ﬁnancial per-
formance, though the nature of the relationship is
generally positive.

Prior CEO compensation research has focused,
however, almost entirely on the ﬁnancial compo-
nent of ﬁrm performance when assessing the ﬁrm
relationship.
performance–CEO compensation

Given the many recent corporate scandals that
have rocked Wall Street, it is evident that orga-
nizations focusing on ﬁnancial performance at the
expense of other organizational effectiveness mea-
sures run the risk of long-run declines in their
ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Never-
theless, management research has thus far largely
ignored the extent to which executive compensa-
tion systems are structured such that CEOs are
given incentives to go beyond ﬁnancial perfor-
mance in their decision making.

Stakeholder–agency theory and CEO
compensation

While most prior CEO compensation studies have
been founded on agency theory, stakeholder–a-
gency theory provides a useful foundation for the
study of the effects of SM on CEO compensa-
tion. Hill and Jones (1992) developed a view of
the agent–principal relationship based on Jensen
and Meckling’s (1976) notion that the relationship
between managers and stockholders is just one
of a series of relationships that form the mod-
ern corporation. Particularly relevant here are the
unique relationships between managers and the
ﬁrm’s stakeholders that form the basis of stake-
holder–agency theory. Stakeholders are deﬁned
here as those groups or individuals who can affect
or are affected by ﬁrm’s actions (Freeman, 1984).
This stakeholder deﬁnition is inclusive in nature
and covers a broad variety of individuals, groups,
and entities, such as shareholders, employees, cus-
tomers, suppliers, the community, and the natural
environment.

CEOs have direct control over ﬁrm-level deci-
sions that directly impact all stakeholder groups.
Clearly, SM is an important component of organi-
zational effectiveness, and it is affected by deci-
sions made at the very top of the organization
(Jones and Wicks, 1999). Due to this unique rela-
tionship, CEOs can be viewed as stakeholders’
agents, not
just shareholders’ agents (Hill and
Jones, 1992). As agents for all the ﬁrm’s stakehold-
ers, CEOs’ actions are monitored and inﬂuenced
by the presence of representatives on the board of
directors (Harrison, 1987; Luoma and Goodstein,
1999). A stakeholder–agency view would suggest
that stakeholder-monitors consider organizational
effectiveness to be enhanced when organizations
meet the needs of a wide variety of stakeholders

Stakeholder Management as a Predictor of CEO Compensation

(Jawahar and McLaughlin, 2001; Jones, 1995),
including both shareholders and non-shareholders.
Following prior research in the area (Hillman
and Keim, 2001), we examine the ﬁrm’s stake-
holder management-related performance with
regard to employees (including diversity initia-
tives), customers (product safety/quality), the nat-
ural environment, the community, and suppliers
(to the extent that certain diversity initiatives are
directed toward suppliers). We contend that the
board of directors compensates CEOs for maxi-
mizing value for these stakeholders because, in
doing so, such CEOs are enhancing the ﬁrm’s
overall effectiveness. Prior research has clearly
suggested that incentives should be structured so
that organizational performance is a key determi-
nant of executive compensation (Tosi et al., 2000).
This alignment has been theorized to be critical
to maximizing long-run ﬁrm performance, but the
focus of prior research has been almost exclusively
on ﬁnancial performance. It seems reasonable to
suggest, however, that boards of directors recog-
nize the value of effective stakeholder management
and seek to design executive compensation sys-
tems such that CEOs are rewarded for maximizing
stakeholder value. Thus:

Hypothesis 1: Stakeholder management (SM)
will have a positive effect on CEO compensation
levels.

Interactions between SM and ﬁnancial
performance
Prior research has consistently suggested that the
ﬁrm’s long-run survival depends on its ability to
satisfy the needs of its various stakeholders (Clark-
son, 1995), beyond just shareholding stakeholders.
Organizations maximize their effectiveness when
their various stakeholders attain maximum value
from the ﬁrm (Donaldson and Preston, 1995). Fur-
thermore, by attending to the needs of the orga-
nization’s various stakeholders, corporate execu-
tives increase the ﬁrm’s performance relative to
the desires of a broad base of constituents, while
at the same time having fewer resources to devote
to self-centered decisions (Hill and Jones, 1992).
This suggests that CEOs may beneﬁt their organi-
zations by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives
designed to add value for multiple stakeholder
groups.

Empirical research generally supports this con-
clusion. For instance, Hillman and Keim (2001)

found a positive relationship between stakeholder
management and shareholder value creation. Og-
den and Watson (1999) reported that enhancing
customer service levels negatively affects short-run
accounting returns but signiﬁcantly enhances share
price. In addition, Berman et al. (1999) concluded
that customer-related and employee-related en-
hancements positively affected return on assets. Fi-
nally, Waddock and Graves (1997) noted that cor-
porate social responsibility was positively related
to accounting returns.

Boards of directors have generally based CEO
compensation partially on the organization’s ﬁnan-
cial performance, although the extent
to which
compensation is based on performance varies from
study to study and from ﬁrm to ﬁrm. One poten-
tial reason that ﬁrm performance has been found
to marginally affect CEO compensation is that
researchers have ignored the complex interrelation-
ships between different types of organizational per-
formance, choosing instead to focus only on ﬁnan-
cial outcomes. Although SM and ﬁnancial per-
formance are unique dimensions of organizational
performance,
they are complementary in nature
and should both affect CEO compensation. In their
study of corporate governance and social respon-
sibility, Johnson and Greening (1999) concluded
that their ﬁndings highlighted the need for direc-
tors to be concerned with both stakeholders’ social
goals and stockholders’ proﬁt goals. We believe
directors’ concerns for both stakeholders’ social
goals and stockholders’ proﬁt goals may take the
form of an interaction effect with regard to their
inﬂuence on CEO compensation. We contend that
the extent to which ﬁnancial performance affects
CEO compensation is partly based on the ﬁrm’s
stakeholder-related performance, and vice versa.
For example, regardless of how highly an organiza-
tion may perform on ﬁnancial criteria, those CEOs
not meeting non-shareholding stakeholders’ needs
may see their compensation adversely affected.
The reverse may also be the case: CEOs meeting
the needs of their non-shareholding stakeholders,
but achieving disappointing ﬁnancial performance,
may not be rewarded for their superior leadership
on stakeholder-related initiatives. CEOs simultane-
ously achieving superior ﬁnancial and stakeholder
performance would be compensated most highly.
Thus, the effects of ﬁnancial performance on CEO
compensation may be contingent on SM, and vice
versa. In other words, ﬁrm performance is clearly a
multidimensional construct, and CEOs performing

well simultaneously on multiple dimensions will
be most highly compensated.

Hypothesis 2: Stakeholder management and ﬁ-
nancial performance interact to predict CEO
compensation levels, such that CEOs simulta-
neously achieving higher levels of both will be
the most highly compensated.

RESEARCH METHOD

Sample and data collection
To test these hypotheses, we collected SM data
from the Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini, and Com-
pany (KLD) database. KLD’s data have been
widely used in empirical studies in premier man-
agement journals over the past several years (see
Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999; Berman
et al., 1999; Graves and Waddock, 1994; Hill-
man and Keim, 2001; Johnson and Greening,
1999; Turban and Greening, 1996; Waddock and
Graves, 1997). These are considered to be the most
comprehensive and prominent data on SM. Ana-
lysts at KLD, a social equity fund advisor, col-
lected KLD’s stakeholder management data. The
database includes all ﬁrms on the Standard and
Poor’s 500, as well as approximately 150 ﬁrms
included in the Domini Social Index.

Firm ﬁnancial performance data and data for
ﬁrm-level control variables were taken from the
Compustat database, while CEO compensation and
characteristics data were drawn from the Exec-
ucomp database. Although it is uncertain as to
exactly how long it takes SM to affect CEO com-
pensation, we believe that a 1-year lag is appro-
priate here. The choice of the appropriate lag
presented an interesting challenge,
in particular
because we are aware of no studies that specif-
ically address the matter. However, given that
CEO compensation is determined annually and is
generally based on the ﬁrm’s performance over
the prior year, a 1-year lag seems the appropri-
ate choice. Indeed, prior research examining the
antecedents of CEO compensation has followed a
1-year lag approach (e.g., Balkin, Markman and
Gomez-Mejia, 2000). Although a 1-year lag, cou-
pled with our longitudinal research design, pro-
vides some assurance that reverse causality is
not signiﬁcantly affecting our results (Benner and
Tushman, 2002), we followed the process outlined

by Hillman and Keim (2001) and found little evi-
dence of a recursive relationship in a series of
additional analyses designed speciﬁcally to test for
reverse causality. Data were available for 406 ﬁrms
and their CEOs. Firms in the sample represented
a total of 47 2-digit SIC code industries and had
average 1999 sales of approximately $11 billion.

Estimation methods
An unbalanced panel data set relating to a sam-
ple of ﬁrms for the period 1995–2001 is analyzed.
As both ﬁrm-speciﬁc and time-speciﬁc effects are
likely to be present, a panel estimation procedure
is used (Chamberlain, 1982) including a White
heteroskedasticity-consistent variance–covariance
matrix (White, 1980). While a ﬁxed-effects speci-
ﬁcation is a more conservative approach (Greene,
1995), the analyses include industry control vari-
ables that are invariant over
time and there-
fore necessitate the use of random-effects models
(Greene, 1995; Sanders, 2001). The ﬁrm is the
primary stratiﬁcation variable, so that there is a
406-item unbalanced panel, with a time series of
between three and seven observations in each stra-
tum. There are a total of 2297 observations in
the panel. Year dummy variables were included
to eliminate year-speciﬁc heterogeneity (Bergh,
1993).

Measures
Dependent variables
Our primary dependent variables were the different
categories of CEO compensation, including salary,
bonus, stock options granted value, and total com-
pensation. Stock options were valued using the
Black–Scholes options pricing model. The aver-
age CEO in our study had total compensation of
approximately $6.5 million.

Independent variables and moderators
Our independent variables were ﬁve types of SM
found in the KLD database. Because these mea-
sures have been used extensively in prior research,
we will only summarize them here. We measured
SM as it related to the following: community rela-
tions, diversity, employee relations, environmen-
tal impact, and product safety/quality (customer
related). These ﬁve dimensions best reﬂect a stake-
holder view of the organization (Agle et al., 1999).

Stakeholder Management as a Predictor of CEO Compensation

831

Each ﬁrm’s performance on these dimensions is
determined by KLD after extensive investigation
of public records, surveys, and even facilities vis-
its by the KLD analysts (Berman et al., 1999).
After this data collection, ﬁrms are given rat-
ings on 5-point Likert-type scales, with a score
of −2 suggesting poor social performance and a
+2 indicating superior social performance. To test
for interaction effects between SM and ﬁnancial
performance, we measured ﬁnancial performance
using return on assets (following Berman et al.,
1999) and total returns to shareholders. Each of
these was drawn from the Compustat database for
the year prior to our CEO compensation measure.

Control variables
Several industry-, ﬁrm-, and CEO-speciﬁc con-
trol variables used in prior research were included
in our study to enhance conﬁdence in our ﬁnd-
ings. Prior research has suggested that industry
effects may inﬂuence both compensation strate-
gies (Gerhart and Milkovich, 1990; Stroh et al.,
1996) and stakeholder management (Agle et al.,
1999; Hillman and Keim, 2001; Hillman et al.,
2001; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Following
Hillman and Keim (2001), we therefore created
industry dummy variables measured at the 2-digit
SIC code level. Firm size was measured by the
logarithm of sales following prior CEO compen-
sation research using similar samples (Belliveau
et al., 1996; Finkelstein and Boyd, 1998; Sanders,
2001; Sanders and Carpenter, 1998). Prior research
has shown that ﬁrm size generally has a signif-
icant effect on CEO compensation (Tosi et al.,
2000), and larger ﬁrms may have lower average
costs than smaller ﬁrms when implementing social
performance-related initiatives (McWilliams and
Siegel, 2001). Thus, ﬁrm size is an important con-
trol variable.

CEO-related factors included CEO share own-
ership and CEO tenure with the current ﬁrm in
days. A CEO’s tenure may inﬂuence compen-
sation levels because newer CEOs are likely to
receive different levels and types of compensation
than longer-tenured ones (Hambrick and Finkel-
stein, 1995). CEO equity ownership was included
as a control variable because it has long been
considered an important potential antecedent of
CEO compensation (see Finkelstein, 1992). CEO
equity ownership was measured as the percentage
of shares outstanding owned by the CEO.

RESULTS

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics and correla-
tions for the variables included in this study. On
average, CEOs were paid $739,000 in salary and
received $986,000 in bonus compensation. Stock
options value averaged $4,700,000 while on aver-
age CEOs owned 1.5 percent of their ﬁrms. Mul-
tiple regression and moderated multiple regression
analyses were used to test our hypotheses. The
results of these analyses are shown in Tables 2
and 3. To aid in interpreting our interaction results,
each variable included in the interaction terms was
centered (Aiken and West, 1991). While centering
our data helps minimize multicollinearity prob-
lems, we tested for the presence of multicollinear-
ity in our analyses by examining variance inﬂation
factors (VIF). These analyses showed no indication
of multicollinearity, thus each of the interaction
terms was included in one analysis. Table 2 reports
results using ROA as ﬁrm performance, while
Table 3 shows our results when ﬁnancial perfor-
mance is measured using shareholder returns.

Models 1, 4, 7, and 10 of Tables 2 and 3 present
our control variable results for salary, bonus, stock
options, and total compensation as dependent vari-
ables, respectively. Consistent with prior research,
ﬁrm size and ﬁnancial performance were both pos-
itively associated with each type of compensation.
Stock ownership and tenure were negatively asso-
ciated with salary, but unrelated to the other forms
of compensation. Main effects for each of our
SM performance measures are reported in Mod-
els 2, 5, 8, and 11 of Tables 2 and 3. The com-
munity, diversity, environment, and product per-
formance variables were all negative and signif-
icant for salary, suggesting that CEOs are given
incentives to decrease their focus on stakeholder
management. These results refute our prediction
in Hypothesis 1 that SM performance would have
a positive effect on CEO compensation. Rather,
CEOs appear to be given disincentives to engage
in stakeholder management issues, at least as far
as base salary is concerned. Our results for bonus,
stock options, and total compensation as dependent
variables yield almost no signiﬁcant effects of SM
performance on compensation except for a positive
effect of employee-related SM on bonuses. Given
the number of relationships we explored, however,
this ﬁnding should be viewed with extreme cau-
tion. We found no main effect whatsoever of SM
on stock options or total compensation in either

Stakeholder Management as a Predictor of CEO Compensation

837

Table 2 or Table 3. Thus, our results indicate a
relationship that is the opposite of what was sug-
gested in Hypothesis 1.

Hypothesis 2 proposed that ﬁnancial perfor-
mance and SM interact to predict CEO compen-
sation such that CEOs of ﬁrms having higher SM
and higher ﬁnancial performance would be most
highly compensated. Moderated multiple regres-
sion analyses were used to test this hypothesis. We
created linear-by-linear interaction terms follow-
ing Stone and Hollenbeck (1988) by multiplying
ﬁnancial performance (either ROA or 1-year share-
holder return) by the ﬁve types of SM. After enter-
ing the proposed main effects into the regression
model, we then added the multiplicative terms. As
with our main effects models, there appears to be
a predominantly negative interaction effect of SM
and ﬁnancial performance on compensation. Our
two types of ﬁnancial performance, ﬁve types of
SM, and four types of compensation yielded a total
of 40 interaction terms, 12 of which were sig-
niﬁcant. Of these 12, eight were in the direction
opposite of our hypothesis. SM tended to reduce
the positive effects of ﬁnancial performance on the
various types of compensation. Consistent patterns
were difﬁcult to ﬁnd, however, with regard to a
given interaction’s effects across multiple types of
compensation, or with respect to the effects of mul-
tiple interactions on a single type of compensation.
One exception, however, is a negative interaction
of community-related SM and shareholder returns
on salary, stock options, and total compensation.
In sum, we feel that our results should be viewed
with caution, with the exception of the negative
main effects we found of SM on CEO salaries.

DISCUSSION

Despite being one of the most highly researched
areas in the management ﬁeld, empirical investi-
gations of CEO compensation and organizational
effectiveness have been limited by researchers’
reliance on ﬁnancial measures of organizational
effectiveness. This study’s purpose was to examine
the effects of a different organizational effective-
ness measure, SM, on CEO compensation. Our
main effects models provide evidence that the SM
dimensions of community, diversity, environment,
and product performance are negatively associ-
ated with CEO salaries. These results indicate
that a proactive approach to SM on the part of

CEOs may negatively affect their personal wealth.
Our tests for interactions between SM and ﬁnan-
cial performance yielded similar results, though
the bulk of the interactions were non-signiﬁcant.
Boards apparently give negative reinforcement to
their CEOs for engaging in stakeholder value-
enhancing initiatives. This may occur because
proactive behavior is costly in terms of ﬁnancial
and managerial resources (Jawahar and McLaugh-
lin, 2001).

Our results suggest that boards consider both
ﬁnancial
and stakeholder-related performance
when determining CEO compensation, especially
with regard to main effects on salary. Our ﬁnd-
ings of a negative SM effect on salary and many
negative interactions between SM and ﬁrm ﬁnan-
cial performance are interesting in light of John-
son and Greening’s (1999) observation that boards
are concerned with both stakeholders’ social goals
and stockholders’ proﬁt goals. Our results suggest
that, to more fully understand the complex rela-
tionships between ﬁrm performance and the vari-
ous types of CEO compensation, researchers must
move beyond ﬁnancial performance and consider
a broader view of organizational effectiveness that
includes different dimensions of social (Freeman,
1984; Hillman et al., 2001) and innovative (Balkin
et al., 2000) performance.

Although the results of our moderated multi-
ple regression models should be interpreted with
caution, several observations can be made. Results
suggest that CEOs who simultaneously maximize
environment-related SM and ﬁnancial performance
may be rewarded with greater salaries, while CEOs
maximizing diversity-related SM and ﬁnancial per-
formance may be rewarded with higher bonuses.
The diversity results are consistent with prior
research that has clearly explicated a positive con-
nection between diversity and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance outcomes (Richard, 2000). We also found
evidence that the interaction of diversity-related
SM and ROA was negatively related to salaries,
which is consistent with CEO risk aversion asso-
ciated with ﬁxed compensation (Jensen and Mur-
phy, 1990; McGuire et al., 2003; Zajac and West-
phal, 1994). Our positive results for CEOs achiev-
ing greater levels of ﬁnancial and environment-
related SM appear inconsistent with prior ﬁndings
by Mathur and Mathur (2000) and Gilley et al.
(2000). Interestingly, a CEO’s salary for achieving
greater shareholder return appears to be reduced
those CEOs focusing on employee-related
for

SM. This result supports research that has found
positive market reactions to announcements of
union de-certiﬁcation petitions and elections (Huth
and MacDonald, 1990). Finally, consistent with
CEO risk aversion toward ﬁxed compensation, the
interaction of ﬁnancial performance (measured by
ROA) and product performance is negatively asso-
ciated with CEO salary compensation.

Hillman and Keim (2001) suggest it would be
beneﬁcial for researchers to more fully understand
how managers prioritize and manage stakeholder
demands. With few exceptions our results sug-
gest that CEOs are given negative signals from
boards of directors with regard to enhancing ﬁrm
value to its various stakeholders. CEOs do appear
to be rewarded (through bonus compensation) for
employee-related SM performance, but again this
ﬁnding should be viewed with caution. These
ﬁndings indicate, however, that boards generally
punish stakeholder-related managerial initiatives.
This conclusion not only affects CEO compen-
sation in isolation, but also affects the extent to
which CEOs are rewarded for ﬁnancial perfor-
mance itself. Therefore,
is likely that CEOs
will respond to this incentive system in a way
that maximizes their own rewards, often at the
expense of the organization’s various stakeholder
groups.

it

Limitations and future research

An important research limitation is the lack of
attention to the complex relationships among board
members and between the board and the CEO that
ultimately determine CEO compensation. We have
taken a more coarse-grained approach by using
CEO compensation as a proxy for those behav-
iors that boards are rewarding. Researchers should
extend this line of inquiry by collecting primary
data from directors, especially those serving on
compensation committees, dealing with the extent
to which they value and reward SM-related behav-
iors on the part of their ﬁrm’s CEO.

Our ﬁndings’ generalizability is also somewhat
limited. Given that our sample consisted only of
the largest publicly held companies in the United
States, it remains uncertain whether our results are
generalizable to smaller public ﬁrms, private ﬁrms,
non-proﬁt and government agency executives, and
ﬁrms outside the United States. These limitations
may partially explain the relatively small amount

of bonus, stock option, and total compensation
variation we are able to explain.

Our results suggest several avenues for clarify-
ing the relationship between organizational perfor-
mance and CEO compensation. First, researchers
should take care to separate salary and contingent
compensation. Researchers have often combined
these types of compensation to form a single mea-
sure (Geletkanycz, Boyd, and Finkelstein, 2001;
Henderson and Fredrickson, 1996). Our results
show that the organizational effectiveness mea-
sures used in this study have very different rela-
tionships with ﬁxed vs. contingent compensa-
tion,
likely due to CEO risk aversion (Jensen
and Murphy, 1990; McGuire et al., 2003; Zajac
and Westphal, 1994). Second, researchers should
expand their conception of organization perfor-
mance to include variables beyond ﬁnancial per-
formance such as innovative (Balkin et al., 2000),
social, and diversiﬁcation performance. Finally,
research clarifying board member attitudes toward
SM would beneﬁt our understanding of the induce-
ments
and corporate
governance.

to satisfy stakeholders

CONCLUSION

This paper has extended research into CEO com-
pensation antecedents by examining the extent to
which America’s top executives are rewarded or
punished for pursuing stakeholder-related initia-
tives. Our results provide evidence that the main
effects of SM on CEO compensation are more
often negative than positive, and that
the only
form of compensation substantially affected by
SM is salary. Our results also suggest that the
interaction effects between ﬁnancial performance
and SM were generally negative. We therefore
conclude that social performance is relevant
to
compensation committees when setting CEO com-
pensation, and that CEOs are typically dissuaded
from pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives.
