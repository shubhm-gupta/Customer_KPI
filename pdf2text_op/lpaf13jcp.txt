This study explores the joint impact on ﬁrm performance of the decision to adopt quality and envi-
ronmental practices in small service companies. In the literature existing to date insufﬁcient attention
has been given to small service companies in general, and to the restaurant sector in particular. Most of
the studies conducted into environmental practices have thus focused on the industrial sector and on
larger companies. This work is based on 374 surveys involving the managers of restaurants, using
structural equation modeling to study the links between the dimensions studied. The ﬁndings of this
study state that Quality Management Practices have a signiﬁcant direct impact on market success factors
but not on companies’ proﬁt and loss statements. On the other hand, the study shows a signiﬁcant
relationship between Environment Management Practices and ﬁnancial performance. The article
suggests that being proactive on quality and environmental issues can bring small service companies
a great number of beneﬁts that improve their competitiveness.

1. Introduction

Quality and environment management practices are two of the
key drivers for achieving market success and ﬁnancial performance
in service industries (Karim et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2008; Alonso-
Almeida et al., 2012).

Most small companies, however, have not adopted a quality or
environmental management system due to various barriers to
doing so, such as cost, lack of training personnel or non-inclusion
in the ﬁrm’s management strategy (Chan, 2011). Nevertheless,
some quality and environmental practices have been adopted by
numerous small companies. Such management practices take
on particular importance when they are used as strategies to
differentiate small service companies from their competitors
(Rubio-Andrada et al., 2011; Alonso-Almeida and Rodriguez-Anton,
2011; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2011), in a context in which econo-
mies of scale do not apply and operational costs can have a suffo-
cating effect on the company concerned.

Prior research into service companies has mainly focused,
separately, on either the positive impact of Quality Management
Practices (QMPs) on performance (e.g. Kaynak, 2003; Corbett et al.,
2005; Terlaak and King, 2006; Nair, 2006; Claver-Cortes et al., 2008;
Climent-Serrano, 2010; Ruiz-Molina et al., 2011; Rubio-Andrada
et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Anton et al., 2011; Alonso-Almeida et al.,
2012) or the proﬁtable impact of environmental management
practices (EMPs) on performance (e.g. Enz and Siquaw, 1999;
Goodman, 2000; Alvarez et al., 2001; Kassinis and Soteriou, 2003;
Carmona-Moreno et al., 2004; Molina-Azorín et al., 2009; Alonso-
Almeida and Rodriguez-Anton, 2011).
Little research has,
however, been undertaken to examine the combined impact of
QMPs and EMPs on service industries. This is the general situation
throughout the service sector with the exception of the hospitality
industry, where some such studies have nevertheless been con-
ducted (Alonso-Almeida et al., 2011, 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al.,
2012). This lack of research becomes even more pronounced
when the speciﬁc case of small service companies is examined in
any sector apart from hospitality. Each industry develops different
types of QMPs and EMPs and to different degrees of adoption,
which will therefore result in different effects and results. For these
reasons,
in order to identify speciﬁc organizational behavior
patterns, Lee (2009) pointed to the needed for quantitative research
into a speciﬁc industry in relation to SMEs. In keeping with the

recommendations made by a number of authors (e.g. Kassinis and
Soteriou, 2003; Hillary, 2004), the present study focuses on
another speciﬁc branch of the tourist service industry in which
there is a predominance of small or micro-companies, i.e. the
restaurant sector. Moreover, the activities of companies operating
in the restaurant sector revolve around two components, food
production and service delivery, for which the adoption of both
quality and environmental practices could be crucial for competi-
tiveness. Thus, in relation to food production, the adoption of QMPs
helps to save time and money by standardizing certain actions
(Molina-Azorín et al., 2009; Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012), and EMPs
reduce waste and water and energy consumption (Alonso-Almeida,
2012). In the case of service delivery, service quality is a key driver
to achieving customer satisfaction and loyalty (Ribeiro, 2003;
Ladhari et al., 2008; Hyun, 2010), while EMPs could attract new
market segments (Hu et al., 2010; Jang et al., 2011).

Moreover, another reason for restricting the survey to this
subsector is that, according to Eurostat (2012), the food and
beverages subsector accounted in 2011 for 85.4% of all companies in
the EU-27’s accommodation and food services sector, and for 76.1%
of the persons employed and 65.6% of the value added within it.

This paper thus adds to previous research in a number of ways.
First, it sheds light on the main QMPs adopted and the impact of
such decisions on ﬁrm performance both directly and as modiﬁed
by environmental management practices. Second, it increases the
understanding of the environmental behavior of the service sector.
Third, it provides an analysis of the effect of QMPs and EMPs on ﬁrm
performance. In this study, ﬁrm performance is measured in terms
of two aspects: companies’ market success factors (e.g., their image,
their levels of customer and employee satisfaction), and their
ﬁnancial performance. Fourth, it focuses on a service industry
which has not previously been studied in this respect, thus
providing useful empirical evidence for managerial practice in this
industry. Finally, it provides new evidence about the importance of
environmental practices to the service sector and their impact on
companies’ organization and performance.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2
discusses the theoretical arguments concerning the adoption of
QMPs and EMPs and the relationship with ﬁrm performance.
Section 3 describes the empirical design of this study. Section 4
presents a quantitative analysis, followed by Section 5, which
presents the study’s ﬁndings. Section 6 concludes this paper with
several conclusions drawn both from the research and from
observed business practice.

2. Literature review

2.1.

Impact of quality management on ﬁrm performance

Previous research has also pointed to a certain number of critical
drivers of quality management, such as management commitment,
quality planning, quality improvement and quality control (Saraph
et al., 1989). However, Zhao et al. (2004) stated that not all QMPs are
equally effective in all organizations, especially in the case of small
service ﬁrms, where QMPs such as management support, customer
focus and process management, seemed to be more effective than
detailed processes and complex systems. Given that QMPs could be
considered as being unique to each company (Sousa and Aspinwall,
2010), small companies could choose certain QMPs and improve
their performance even without adopting a speciﬁc standard
management system or complex management practices (such as
the examples shown in Appendix A).

A debate exists about the extent of the impact of QMPs on ﬁrm
performance as measured in ﬁnancial terms. Most research has
pointed to a positive effect on ﬁnancial performance, due to

operational improvements in the form of more effective control of
processes and products that lead to savings by reducing repetitive
tasks and reducing waste. This has beneﬁcial effects on the service
provided, and can lead to improvements in the company’s ﬁnancial
performance (Callan, 1992; Samson and Terziovski, 1999; Nield and
Kozak, 1999; Forza and Flippini, 1998; Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000;
Kaynak, 2003; Corbett et al., 2005; Terlaak and King, 2006; Rubio-
Andrada et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2011; Alonso-Almeida
et al., 2012). However, some studies have asserted that this positive
effect is limited in scope (Nair, 2006), mainly because the imple-
mentation of QMPs inevitably involves speciﬁc costs in terms of
training, planning and control management. Given that most
previous research nevertheless concluded that QMPs may make
companies more proﬁtable thanks to cost reductions and improved
income due to an increasing number of customers and of
repurchases, this hypothesis is proposed:

H1a. Quality Management Practices (QMPs) are likely to have
a direct positive impact on ﬁnancial performance in restaurants.

In relation to restaurants, prior research has shown that the
main market success factors are quality of service, customer satis-
faction and strong image (Ribeiro, 2003; Chow et al., 2007; Noone
et al., 2007; Ladhari et al., 2008; Azar, 2009; Hyun, 2010; Susskind,
2010; Black, 2012).

Thus, Yong and Wilkinson (2003) found in relation to a restau-
rant chain that they studied that key drivers in Quality Manage-
ment Practices are strong management support, employee and
supplier involvement, a culture of continuous improvement and
control management. These QM practices contribute to maintain-
ing competitiveness in both internal and external respects.

With regard to the internal dimension, training in service
quality and rewarding employees for suggestions made in the
framework of continuous improvement schemes have the effect of
increasing employee satisfaction (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003).
Indeed, a positive atmosphere in which workers derive satisfaction
from doing a good job (Azar, 2009) may produce a “virtuous cycle”
effect that can encourage them to provide a better service (Walker
and Salameh, 1996; Nield and Kozak, 1999; Testa and Sipe, 2006).
In terms of the external dimension, good quality of service was
found to have a strong relationship with customer satisfaction with
the restaurants (Ribeiro, 2003; Chow et al., 2007; Ladhari et al.,
2008; Hyun, 2010), with improved corporate image thanks to
positive word-of-mouth, and with conﬁdence in the company
(Hyun, 2010; Hyun and Kim, 2011). In accordance with the ﬁndings
of prior research, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H1b. Quality Management Practices (QMPs) are likely to have
a direct positive impact on market success factors in restaurants.

2.2.

Impact of environmental management on ﬁrm performance

According to Blanco et al. (2009), a reduction in the consump-
tion of resources or in the generation of waste is the ﬁrst incentive
to implement environmental practices in the service sector.
Companies usually adopt this type of environmental practice in
order to achieve savings in their consumption costs, since they do
not require signiﬁcant investment but may provide an immediate
ﬁnancial beneﬁt (Zeng et al., 2010).

The adoption of environmental practices also has an indirect
impact on ﬁnancial performance. The reason for this is that the
company concerned may have achieved savings in its consumption,
reduced the cost of its operations and improved its overall oper-
ating conditions (Vazquez et al., 2001; Fernandez-Viñé et al., 2010;
Bagur et al., in press). Thus, Aragon-Correa et al. (2008), found
a positive and direct relationship between the adoption of eco-
efﬁcient practices and ﬁnancial performance in small industrial


98

ﬁrms. In relation to services, some authors (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2001;
Molina-Azorín et al., 2009) showed that hotels that were more
environmentally proactive achieved a better ﬁnancial performance.
There may well be a direct logical reason for this, given that Trung
and Kumar (2005) found that in the Vietnamese hotel industry the
highest consumption of water and energy was for guests’ rooms
and for the kitchens, with the kitchens representing the greatest
cause of waste. Therefore, when measures of control are taken and
practiced this could have an immediate effect on invoices. Hence,
the following hypothesis is proposed:

H2a. Environmental management practices (EMPs) are likely to
have a direct positive impact on ﬁnancial performance in restaurants.
When a company adopts and implements environmental prac-
tices, it can improve its image, attract a new category of customer,
further satisfy existing customers and thus ensure a better overall
position for the company in the market (Hillary, 2004; Molina-
Azorín et al., 2009; Alonso-Almeida and Rodriguez-Anton, 2011;
Bagur et al., in press). Moreover, the company’s employees may
experience greater satisfaction, in that its environmental commit-
ment opens up a new channel of communication between staff and
management that may well enhance staff morale and the general
working atmosphere in the company (Kassinis and Soteriou, 2003;
Cote et al., 2006). Employees’ commitment to environmental
concerns may subsequently become increasingly identiﬁed with
the company’s objectives (Enz and Siquaw, 1999; Kassinis and
Soteriou, 2003). In accordance with prior research, the following
hypothesis is thus proposed:

H2b. Environmental management practices (EMPs) are likely to
have a direct positive impact on market success factors in restaurants.

2.3. Strategies on the adoption of management practices and
impact on ﬁrm performance

As mentioned above, QMPs and EMPs help companies to be
more competitive, which is why prior research found that
companies of all sizes adopted ﬁrst QMPs and then EMPs
(Karapetrovic and Willborn, 1998; Zeng et al., 2007; Karapetrovic
and Casadesus, 2009; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2012).
In small
companies the adoption strategy is the same (Douglas and Glen,
2000). The adoption of both QMPs and EMPs has been a growing
concern in the tourism industry in recent years (Casadesus et al.,
2010; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2012). Moreover, Rodriguez-Anton
et al. (2012) suggested that these practices add value to the busi-
ness. Pereira-Moliner et al. (2012) reinforced this idea. These
authors suggested that QMPs could provide an improvement in
efﬁciency and effectiveness in the adoption of other organizational
practices such as EMPs, because QMPs avoid duplications, reduce
waste, simplify procedures, minimize unnecessary activities and
improve communication and employee learning (Rodriguez-Antón
and Alonso-Almeida, 2011).

This reasoning is in line with previous research into integrated
management systems (Karapetrovic and Willborn, 1998; Douglas
and Glen, 2000; Zutshi and Sohal, 2005; Zeng et al., 2007;
Salomone, 2008; Karapetrovic and Casadesus, 2009), which
conﬁrmed that an optimization of resources is thus produced. Thus,
QMPs could lead to the adoption of EMPs with less effort and fewer
resources due to the competences achieved through the QMPs
already developed (Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012).

Therefore this hypothesis is proposed:

H3. Adoption of QMPs impacts positively on the adoption of EMPs
in restaurants.

Today companies have to face a range of complex situations
including stiff competition, a hostile economic environment,

a decline in demand, ﬁnancial downturns and changes in
consumers’ behavior (O’Connor and Frew, 2002; Kim et al., 2007;
Briggs et al., 2007). So many challenges create a need for companies
to develop distinctive features in order to maintain their position in
the market (Russo and Fouts, 1997).

Market success entails internal and external factors (Parsa et al.,
2005). In the case of restaurants the main drivers are human capital
(Yong and Wilkinson, 2003), customer satisfaction (Cohen, 1997;
Susskind et al., 2007; Susskind, 2010; Black, 2012) and a strong
company image (Susskind, 2002; Noone et al., 2007; Hyun and
Kim, 2011).

From an internal viewpoint, human resources are a major key to
ensuring customer satisfaction, given that employees are crucial to
delivering a high quality service. When customers perceive efforts
to provide a quality service, this affects both their level of satis-
faction and their purchase intentions (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003;
Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012). Therefore, employees impact directly
on their company’s ﬁnancial performance.

From an external viewpoint, two factors are relevant. First,
customer satisfaction is crucial to producing repurchase intentions,
positive word-of-mouth and customer loyalty, and thus an
improved ﬁnancial performance (Susskind et al., 2007: Alonso-
Almeida, 2012). The second factor is company image. Consumers
usually have conﬁdence in companies with a strong market image
(i.e. strong brand references), even when they have never had
direct contact with the company. Consumers are therefore more
willing to purchase from this kind of company. In this way, both
drivers have a direct impact on ﬁnancial performance.

Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:

H4. Market success factors impacts positively on ﬁnancial
performance in restaurants.

In Fig. 1 below we present a proposed model based on the

hypotheses postulated above.

3. Methodology

3.1. Population and sample

The data used in the empirical section of the paper were ob-
tained from a survey conducted in November and December 2010,
in the region of Madrid, Spain, through personal interviews with
the managers of 374 establishments in the food and beverage
services subsector (division 56, NACE Rev.2). Eurostat (2012) deﬁnes
the food and beverage services subsector as those ﬁrms that
“provide complete meals or drinks ﬁt for immediate consumption,
regardless of the type of facility providing the service.”

The main reason for restricting the survey to this subsector is
because, according to Eurostat (2012), the food and beverages
subsector accounted in 2011 for 85.4% of all enterprises in the

Fig. 1. Final model with hypothesis.

EU-27’s accommodation and food services sector, and for 76.1% of
the persons employed and 65.6% of the value added within it.

These ﬁgures take on particular importance in the Spanish
context because, in terms of value added, Spain is the joint leader in
the EU (together with Austria) in terms of specialization in these
activities. Speciﬁcally, in Spain the food and beverage services
subsector employed 969,196 persons in 261,320 ﬁrms in 2009,
representing approximately 6% of the GDP in Spain (Spanish
National Statistics Institute, 2012).

The questionnaire was divided into three main sections: quality,
environment and society. Moreover, there was a supplementary
section asking for information about the company’s proﬁle.

The sample is balanced between café-bars and restaurants. By
typology, most of the ﬁrms were independent ﬁrms and, in terms of
company history, more than half of the ﬁrms had been established
for less than 10 years. See Table 1.

3.2. Measures

‘management

Based on the above review of the literature and in the light of the
hypotheses addressed, four constructs were explored in this study.
The ﬁrst construct was Quality Management Practices (QMPs).
The variables explored to measure quality management adoption
were
collaboration’,
‘provider collaboration’, ‘delivery service’, ‘objectives monitor’ and
‘quality culture’. The second factor, Environmental Management
Practices (EMPs), was also measured in terms of six dimensions:
‘environmental
‘environ-
mental marketing’, ‘environmental activities’, ‘long-term environ-
mental strategic focus’ and ‘environmental savings and costs’.

‘environmental

commitment’,

initiatives’,

‘customer

training’,

Finally, in order to measure the impact on ﬁrms’ performance of
the implementation of the above-mentioned practices, the present
paper uses a valid and reliable scale developed by Camisón (1999)
and used lately by other authors such as Pereira-Moliner et al.
(2012). We adapted this scale and divided it into two dimensions:
Market Success Factors (MSF) and Financial Performance (FP). MSF
were measured in terms of ‘corporate image’, ‘customer satisfaction’
and ‘employee satisfaction’, while FP included measures of ‘proﬁts’,
‘activity’ and ‘occupation’. The deﬁnitions of the variables used to
measure the four constructs, the variable codes and the references
on which they were based are detailed in Appendix A.

For measuring the dimensions of Quality and Environmental
Management Practices and Market Success Factors, respondents
were required to choose a value from a 7-point Likert scale
(1 meaning “totally disagree” and 7 meaning “totally agree”).
On the other hand, the variables used for measuring Financial
Performance were ﬁve percentage intervals, following the scale
proposed by Camisón (1999).

4. Results

4.1. Exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis

To validate the proposed model, a strictly-controlled process
was followed in two stages: ﬁrstly, an exploratory factor analysis of
the four constructs and, secondly, a conﬁrmatory factor analysis. In
both stages the proposed model was assessed on the basis of
statistical criteria.

The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed for each
factor to identify the latent dimensions deriving from the data used
in the study. The scales were analyzed in accordance with the
recommendations made by Hair et al. (1998) and Ladhari (2010). In
all cases the items (i) load at more than .5 on a factor, (ii) do not load
at more than .50 in two factors, and (iii) have an item to total
correlation of more than .40. According to Table 2 the loads of the
variables in the four factors are over .7.

In addition, in order to conﬁrm the existence of linear depen-
dence between the variables, the correlation matrix was subjected
to the Bartlett’s test of sphericity. Moreover, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(KMO) index also conﬁrmed that factor analysis was likely to
generate satisfactory results (Visauta, 1998).

Next, the average variance extracted (AVE) for each factor
was compared to the correlation with the other factors. It was
thus possible to analyze the existence of discriminant validity
(Chin, 1998). Table 3 shows that for the indicators used in the
present study, on average, each construct was more closely related
to its own dimensions than to the dimensions of other constructs.
Finally, the conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to the
model to verify the factor structures that emerged from the EFA. The
reliability of the resulting factors was assessed using Cronbach’s
alpha. All the constructs had an alpha value of over .6, which
exceeded Malhotra’s (2004) and Nunnaly’s (1978) minimum
internal consistency criterion. Moreover, internal consistency was
tested with the composite reliability indicator. In all cases the results
conﬁrmed the adequacy of the constructs because all items excee-
ded the minimum criterion of .6 for composed reliability coefﬁcient.
Next, within the CFA, structural equation modeling (SEM) was
performed using the maximum likelihood method and EQS soft-
ware to test the model.

In accordance with Table 4, an overall conclusion about the ﬁt of
the model can be obtained by considering these indices simulta-
neously, as recommended by Schermelleh-Engel et al. (2003), and
by obtaining at least three ﬁt statistics indicating an acceptable ﬁt.
In the case of the Chi-square test divided by degrees of freedom,
the values are smaller than 3, as Carmines (1981) proposes. Related
to the model goodness-of-ﬁt
index (GFI) and the adjusted
goodness-of-ﬁt (AGFI), both values are greater than .8, which
indicates an acceptable model ﬁt (Byrne, 1994; Hu and Bentler,
1999). Moreover, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA) has a value of .06 or less, which indicates a good ﬁt model,
as Hu and Bentler (1999) also indicate. Finally, the comparative ﬁt
index (CFI) value is, in all cases, higher than .90, also indicating
a better model ﬁt (Hu and Bentler, 1999).

Therefore, because more than three statistics in the model are
over the recommended values, we can afﬁrm that these measures
of overall ﬁtness reﬂect the explanatory power of the proposed
model.

4.2. Final model

The standardized solution of the causal model is presented
in Fig. 2. The initial dimensionality proposal was conﬁrmed after
a second-order conﬁrmatory analysis with EQS 6.1 software
(Byrne, 1994).

was extended to examine the mediator effect of EMP between QMP
and ﬁrms’ performance, in terms of both Financial Performance and
Market Success Factors.

4.3. Mediation effect of EMP

The mediation effect was measured using the methodology
proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) and later by other authors in
different settings (e.g. Bontis et al., 2007; Petnji et al., 2011; or, more
recently, Kong et al., 2012).

Three control variables were included in the model: classiﬁcation,
typology and age, which were described in Table 1. Classiﬁcation is
a dichotomous variable (0 ¼ casual restaurant; 1 ¼ restaurant),
typology is another dichotomous variable (0 ¼ independent ﬁrm;
1 ¼ subsidiary ﬁrm) and age is a continuous variable.

Baron and Kenny’s (1986) methodology proposes three regres-

sion models:

1. Regressing the mediator on the independent variable
2. Regressing the dependent variable on the independent variable
3. Regressing the dependent variable on both the independent

variable and the mediator

Next, two sets of regression analysis were performed (Tables 5a
and b) following Baron and Kenny’s (1986) methodology to test the
mediation effect of EMP between QMP and ﬁrms’ performance.

In the ﬁrst set of regression analysis (Table 5a), we studied the
mediation role of EMP between QMP and FP. Therefore, we
considered QMP to be the independent variable, FP the dependent
variable, and EMP the mediator variable.

Table 5a shows that (i) regression 1a conﬁrms that the inde-
pendent variable affects the mediator, (ii) regression 2a conﬁrms
that the independent variable does not affect the dependent vari-
able, and (iii) regression 3a conﬁrms that the mediation variable
effects on the dependent variable and the independent variable
become insigniﬁcant when the mediation variable is introduced in
the model. However, the conclusions raised from these results may
need to be taken with caution due to the low adjusted R2 value.

In the second set of regression analysis (Table 5b), we study the
mediation role of EMP between QMP and ﬁrms’ performance, but
now in terms of Market Success Factors.

Table 5b shows that (i) regression 1 conﬁrms that the inde-
pendent variable affects the mediator as it was presented in
Table 5a, (ii) regression 2 conﬁrms that the independent variable
also affects the dependent variable, and (iii) regression 3 shows
that the independent variable remains signiﬁcant, although its

may be forced to devise strategies of differentiation which can ﬁt
the QMPs. Employees are directly involved in the implementation
of QMPs, and for this reason it is essential that they should be
committed and motivated to operating internal processes, so that
the customer can perceive and value highly the service received,
resulting in a positive buzz of the kind that can be considered as the
world’s cheapest marketing tool (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003). In
hospitality, previous authors shown that QMPs have a positive
effect on market success and stakeholders satisfaction factors
(Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012). In this
regard, Hypothesis H1b is conﬁrmed.

However, as previous authors have highlighted (e.g. Chan, 2011),
this then provides proof that there is not always a direct effect
between the implementation of quality practices and ﬁnancial
performance.
It is clear that the introduction of QMPs into
a company impacts positively on its image and other key factors for
its survival, although there are signiﬁcant barriers that often make
their implementation expensive. The costs of staff training, and the
preparation of the organization to make it capable when imple-
menting quality methodologies, make the proﬁtability of QMPs
certainly doubtful in many cases. This fact is conﬁrmed in this
present study. Contrary to the study of hospitality conducted by
Pereira-Moliner et al. (2012) in which a positive relation was found
between QMPs and EMPs, in the analyzed sample, the negative
impact of the implementation of QMPs (high costs) is greater than
the positive impact represented by the direct increase in income.
For this reason, Hypothesis H1a is rejected.

In reference to Environmental Management Practices (EMPs),
H2a is conﬁrmed and H2b is rejected. EMPs have direct and positive
impact on FP (ﬁnancial performance) but not on Market Success
Factors (MSF). These results are similar in Pereira-Moliner et al.
(2012). These authors found that EMPs have a positive effect on
ﬁnancial performance but not on stakeholder satisfaction in hotels.
Our ﬁndings partially corroborate previous research. On the one
hand the adoption of EMPs, even though they were considered
“basic” (Alvarez-Gil et al., 2001; Molina-Azorín et al., 2009; Bagur
et al., in press), impacts directly and immediately on operational
costs. Bagur et al. (in press) pointed to a number of beneﬁts for
small service companies. First, EMPs constitute an efﬁcient method
of cost reduction, since the company reduces its costs with no
impact on sales. The customer does not perceive this cost reduction
as a loss of value in terms of the service received. Second, it is a form
of cost reduction that reduces the company’s ﬁxed costs. This type
of reduction not only improves its economic performance but also
improves its ability to remain viable in the market during times of
crisis. A reduction of ﬁxed costs could result in companies
becoming more ﬂexible and less volatile, since they need to sell less
to cover their costs. Finally, this ﬁnding highlights the importance
of environmental policy adoption as a global strategy in addition to
marketing that will enable companies to achieve a competitive
advantage based on customer focus independently of company size.
On the other hand, unlike previous research (Alvarez-Gil, 2001;
Aragon-Correa et al., 2008; Molina-Azorín et al., 2009) this study
has not found any direct impacts between EMPs and MSF. One
possible explanation could be that, unlike QMPs, which improve
the company image, the implementation of EMPs cannot inﬂuence
the competitiveness of the company by improving its “green
image” and enabling it to attract a new category of customers for
the restaurant, when most of the practices adopted are internal
and, therefore, the costumers could not be aware of their use. In the
case of the relationship between QMPs and EMPs, as demonstrated
in previous research (Zutshi and Sohal, 2005; Zeng et al., 2007;
Salomone, 2008; Karapetrovic and Casadesus, 2009; Rodriguez-
Anton et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012) and corroborated
by this study, it seems clear that the adoption of QMPs facilitates

inﬂuence on the dependent variable decreases, and the mediator
does not affect the dependent variable. In this second set of
regression analysis the models adjust much more than the models
presented in Table 5a.

5. Discussion of the results

The results of the statistical analysis validate most of the model
proposed in the previous sections. As stated below, hypotheses are
contrasted one by one and ﬁndings are explained.

As demonstrated by the previous research, the quality of service,
customer satisfaction and external image are the most important
success factors in restaurants. In this sense, the model conﬁrms
a high relationship between these variables and QMPs. It seems
clear that customer relationships should be a priority not only for
large businesses but also for small ones, whose limited resources
make the QMPs a great tool to differentiate themselves from their
competitors in the market (Russo and Fouts, 1997; Parsa et al.,
2005). Small businesses operating in limited markets with high
degrees of competition, as is the case in the sector being studied,

the implementation of EMPs. Moreover, this ﬁnding also points to
the sequence of the implementation process, based ﬁrst on QMPs
and second on EMPs. Service companies prefer to focus on adding
value activities for customers with high visibility, and only later
optimizing internal operations. Another explanation could be some
of the entry barriers to the adoption of either of these management
practices. Thus the adoption of EMPs could be made difﬁcult by
a lack of training and the cost of implementation. In this sense, the
experience of already having established QMPs provides a valuable
learning process for the organization facilitating the adoption of
EMPs, thus creating synergies between both practices. For this
reason Hypothesis H3 is conﬁrmed.

The relationship between MSF and FP is very clearly conﬁrmed. The
key factors described as being necessary for organizations to be able to
ensure their survival in the long term (i.e. through improving their
competitiveness) have a direct and positive impact on FP, as was
described in hypotheses H4. The factors mentioned are either internal
(operational cost reduction and efﬁciency improvement) or external
(external image enhancement, improved positioning). While it has not
shown a direct relationship between QMPs and FP, this study demon-
strates that the implementation through mediating factors of quality
management techniques is ﬁnancially positive for the organization.

Finally,

the “image enhancement” and “internal process
improvement” effects which occur in any organization when the
culture of quality is introduced are subjects which have come to be
studied in depth. There is virtual unanimity, then, that QMPs
improve competitiveness and the ability of a company to survive in
times of crisis, as many studies have indicated. However, the issue
of whether the improvement of competitiveness and image actu-
ally improves the ﬁnancial performance of the company generates
less consensus.

In this regard, this study conﬁrms that improvements in
competitiveness which involve the implantation of QMPs have a real
impact on the ﬁnances of companies, and also facilitate the imple-
mentation of EMPs, which also have a direct impact on results. This
impact is achieved through positioning the organization externally
e in terms of image and customer satisfaction e or by internally
improving the competitiveness of the company e in terms of process
improvement, human resources and reduced operating costs.

6. Conclusions

Hitherto, business practices related to quality and the environ-
ment have already been identiﬁed as two key drivers for achieving
market success and ﬁnancial performance in service ﬁrms.
However, previous studies focused on service companies in
general, with the exception of hospitality, and hence, little research
has been undertaken in relation to small companies. Therefore, the
conclusions drawn from the study of the restaurant industry, where
there is predominance of small and micro-enterprises, may be
especially relevant both for academics and for practitioners.

With regard to the academic aspect, three conclusions can be
drawn from this study. First,
it can be stated that Quality
Management Practices have a signiﬁcant direct impact on Market
Success Factors. Therefore, developing a culture based on the
involvement of managers, working with the client and suppliers to
improve the product, identifying improvements in the service
delivery process, monitoring compliance with objectives and
where appropriate, the correction of any deviation from them, and
the implementation of a culture of continuous improvement has
a signiﬁcant direct impact on the corporate image of the business,
and on customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction.
It is
particularly crucial
to achieve employee involvement and
commitment as a result of a high degree of contact between
customers and employees (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003; Rodriguez-

Anton and Alonso-Almeida, 2011). In contrast, the study did not
show that there is a signiﬁcant direct relationship between QMPs
and FP. Second, following the above argument, the study shows that
there is a signiﬁcant relationship between EMPs and FP but not
between EMPs and MSF. Therefore, restaurants that implement an
active environmental policy in the form of initiatives such as
establishing a long-term environmental strategy and quantifying
the savings and costs of their environmental policies, subsequently
experience a direct improvement in their operating proﬁts in terms
of ﬁnancial performance. To optimize this strategy externally the
small service company may thus adopt an environmentally
responsible posture that helps to create a positive public image and
turn it into an example for other companies in the sector (Enz and
Siquaw, 1999; Hillary, 2004; Fernandez-Viñé et al., 2010).

Third, the study shows that although it is only environmental
practices that have a direct effect on proﬁts, economic activity and
occupation, any quality practices that a restaurant implements may
actually have an indirect effect on these variables. In this regard, it
is shown from the results that, although it was only EMPs that had
a direct signiﬁcant effect on FP, EMPs were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
by QMPs. Thus, according to these ﬁndings, it can be concluded that
QMPs are still important for achieving FP, but that this importance
is exercised in an indirect way, mediated by the implementation of
EMPs. Restaurants could achieve the best performance by jointly
adopting QMPs and EMPs in a proactive manner.

Three conclusions can be drawn from the study that may be of
direct interest to professional practitioners working in the sector.
First, it can be concluded that the signiﬁcant positive relationship
between QMPs and MSF should lead restaurant managers to
consider implementing quality policies. If these businesses could
manage to train their employees to apply quality practices at an
organizational level, they would experience an improvement in
their operational processes leading to customer satisfaction with
the product they offer in their establishment. However, such
practices, in the case of restaurants, do not have a direct positive
effect on operational proﬁts in this type of micro-company. The
limited degree of mutual inﬂuence between these two variables is
explained by the fact that implementing quality policies can be
expensive, especially in micro-enterprises with very limited
resources. An increase in costs due to staff training or the intro-
duction of a continuous improvement policy in the organization
could thus have a negative effect on the business’s proﬁtability.

Second, the fact that the study shows a direct relationship
between EMPs and FP should raise awareness among restaurant
managers of the importance of implementing an environmental
policy in their businesses in order to improve their proﬁts. In any
case, since the environmental practices are likely to be imple-
mented as an internal process, they are less visible to external
customers. Their impact on the MSF is less signiﬁcant than their
impact on competitiveness due to the implementation of quality
practices.

Third, the direct mutual inter-effects operating between QMPs
and EMPs should lead restaurant managers to focus on the imple-
mentation of such practices in order to take full advantage of their
beneﬁts. The study shows that environmental practices in restau-
rants are inﬂuenced by the implementation of quality practices,
and that environmental practices have a direct inﬂuence on prof-
itability. Additionally,
the relationship with MSF shows the
restaurant’s potential, and its ﬁnancial results will be improved by
the indirect relation referred to above, since it is clear that, ulti-
mately, the balance sheet will be positively inﬂuenced by factors
such as customer satisfaction and enhanced brand image.

This study opens the door to other issues to consider in future
research, such as, for example, whether these results are valid in
other sectors, other small businesses or other regions; and the

practical viability of developing corporate social responsibility prac-
tices within the variables that have been studied during the research.
Finally, this study is subject to certain limitations, one of which
is related to most surveys of this type: the ﬁeld work was per-
formed in a speciﬁc geographical region, and the study results may
be difﬁcult to extrapolate to other countries. Additionally, as only
restaurants have been surveyed, the conclusions may be difﬁcult to
apply in other sectors. Nevertheless, as the survey can justiﬁably be
considered as being representative of the region analyzed, this may
be indicative of the status of this sub-industry in the whole of Spain.
