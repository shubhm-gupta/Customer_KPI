We  developed  and  tested  a  model  examining  the  influence  of  unit-level  voluntary  and  involuntary 
turnover  on  critical  performance  outcomes  within  a  relationship  based  business  context.  Utilizing  the 
notion  of  relational  assets,  we  proposed  that  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  levels  disrupt  the 
existing stock of relationships with customers thus negatively affecting customers’ satisfaction with the 
firm, thereby decreasing unit-level financial performance. We tested our hypotheses using longitudinal 
data related to voluntary and involuntary turnover of full-time staff, customer satisfaction, and financial 
performance (net operating profits per employee) obtained from 46 regional offices of a temporary help 
services (THS) firm. Consistent with our predictions, customer satisfaction with the THS firm mediated 
the  relationship  between  both  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  rates  and  unit-level  financial 
performance. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 

While numerous research articles have been published examining the antecedents of turnover, few 
have  examined  the  consequences  of  turnover  (Holtom,  Mitchell,  Lee,  &  Eberly,  2008).  This  research 
reveals  that  high  levels  of  employee  turnover can  have  negative  effects on  business-unit  performance. 
Specifically, there is support for the argument that voluntary turnover disrupts normal operations of the 
firm (Staw, 1980) and engenders the loss of firm-specific human and social capital (Dess and Shaw 2001; 
Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2005), thereby decreasing unit-level efficiency (Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy, 
Steilberg, & Cerrone, 2006; Morrow & McElroy, 2007), customer service outcomes (Hausknecht, Trevor 
&  Howard,  2009),  and  financial  performance  (Glebbeek  &  Bax,  2004;  Shaw,  Duffy,  Johnson,  & 
Lockhart, 2005; Siebert & Zubanov, 2009). Similarly, involuntary turnover has been found to negatively 
influence business outcomes including organizational efficiency (Zatzick & Iverson, 2006), profitability 
(Guthrie & Datta, 2008), and stock prices (Nixon, Hitt, Lee, & Jeong, 2004). While several studies have 
examined the relationship between turnover and unit-level performance, relatively few have theorized and 
measured the mediators of the turnover-performance relationship for both voluntary (Holtom et al., 2008), 
and involuntary (Datta, Guthrie, Basuil, & Pandey, 2010) turnover, and even fewer have attempted to test 
these mediated relationships using longitudinal designs (Morrow & McElroy, 2007). There is a critical 
need to examine the ‘black box’ or theoretical intermediaries of these effects.

We  address  this  gap  by  proposing  and  testing  a  model  where  customer  satisfaction  mediates  the 
relationship between both forms of turnover and unit performance. Utilizing the notion of relational assets 
(Srivastava, Fahey, & Christensen, 2001), we argue that high turnover levels can destabilize the existing 
stock  of  relationships  between  business  units  and  their  customers,  leading  customers  to  evaluate  the 
business unfavorably, and through their dissatisfaction, affect unit-level financial performance. Given that 
83% of workers in the United States produce a service rather than a product (Lee & Mather, 2008) and 
that  the  value  of  services  are  inextricably  linked  to  the  interaction  between  employees  and  customers 
(Schneider & White, 2004), we believe it is critical to explore the role that effective service relationships 
play in influencing financial performance. We developed our theoretical argument within the context of a 
relationship-based  service  business—temporary  help  services  (THS)—and  tested  it  using  time-lagged 
turnover, customer, and financial performance data gathered from 46 units of a THS firm in the US. 
 
THEORY AND HYPOTHESES 
 
Theorized Mechanisms for the Turnover-Performance Relationship 

Three  theoretical  perspectives  predict  the  negative  influence  of  turnover  levels  on  organizational 
outcomes.  First,  according  to  operational  disruption  theory  (Staw,  1980;  Hausknecht,  et  al.,  2009), 
employee  departures  affect  “the  ability  of  others  to  produce  because  of  the  interdependence  of  work 
roles” (Staw, 1980; p. 256), thus disrupting the normal operations of the unit and diverting unit-resources 
(i.e.,  people,  time,  and  money)  toward  dealing  with  this  disruption.  Although  specific  forms  of 
involuntary turnover (e.g., downsizing and layoffs) are typically initiated by firms in order to increase 
their efficiency levels by reducing labor costs (Freeman & Cameron, 1993), empirical evidence instead 
suggests efficiency reducing (Wagar, 1998; Zatzick & Iverson, 2006) or value-neutral (Baumol, Blinder, 
&  Wolff,  2003)  effects.  Particularly  pertinent  to  our  study  is  the  finding  that  both  dismissals  and 
reduction-in-force  initiatives  are  negatively  associated  with  customer  satisfaction,  productivity,  and 
profitability (McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001). 

Second,  human  capital  theory  (Becker,  1964)  asserts  that  turnover  leads  to  the  depletion  of  firm-
specific human capital and therefore to a decline in firm performance (Shaw et al, 2005). Because firm-
specific human capital includes employees’ knowledge of “specific product features, service agreements, 
pricing, packaging, promotions (and)…demand characteristics of particular individuals or segments (Batt, 
2002; p. 588),” employee turnover can translate into a loss of customer-related knowledge and lead to 
lowered levels of customer service (Liao, Toya, Lepak, & Hong, 2009). 

Third, researchers focusing on social capital or the connections between members of an organization 
view turnover as leading to the dissolution of key relationships between organizational members (Adler & 
Kwon, 2002; Leana & VanBuren, 1999). Regardless of turnover type, loss of key members can lead to 
communication  problems  within  the  firm’s  social  network  and  engender  a  loss  of  efficiency  in 
communication and work flow (Shaw et al., 2005b), which are likely to translate into lowered levels of 
customer satisfaction (Morrow & McElroy, 2007). 

In the context of relationship-based service organizations such as THS firms, we believe that a fourth, 
complementary, theoretical argument applies. In short, we contend that relationships with customers are a 
critical resource for firms (Srivastava, et al., 2001). Considered in this light, high rates of turnover among 
full-time,  permanent  staff  members  can  disrupt  the  ability  of  THS  firms  to  form  effective  service 
relationships with their customers and, thereafter, financial performance. 
 
Turnover Levels and Customer Satisfaction 

Boundary spanning employees constitute a critical link between firms and their customers (Schneider 
& Bowen, 1985; Bettencourt, Brown, & MacKenzie, 2005; Gelade & Young, 2005), and there is evidence 
that  customers’  loyalty  to  the  firm  is  strongly  influenced  by  their  loyalty  to  the  firm’s  representatives 
(Palmatier, Scheer, & Steenkamp, 2007). This is because repeated interactions with customers provide 
employees  with  the  opportunity  to  develop  a  deeper  understanding  and  appreciation  of  individual 
customers’  needs  and  preferences  (Liao  &  Subramony,  2008),  and  consequently  lead  them  to  exert 

50     Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011


discretionary  effort  to  solve  customer  problems  (Bettencourt,  Gwinner,  &  Meuter,  2001).  These 
discretionary  behaviors  are  typically  reciprocated  by  customers  in  the  form  of  attachment  directed 
specifically  toward  the  employee  (Tax  &  Brown,  1998).  Through  frequent  interactions  over  time, 
employees  and  customers  often  form  personal  bonds  or  relationships,  mutual  trust,  and  commitment. 
Overall,  these  relationships  are  difficult  to  replace  (Hunt,  1997;  Hunt  &  Morgan,  1994).  The  loss  of 
relationships can significantly disrupt the stock of relational assets accumulated by the firm, and lead to 
customer dissatisfaction and defection (Bendapudi & Leone, 2001; Tax & Brown, 1998). 

The interactions between THS firms and their customers are characterized by relational exchanges 
(Dwyer,  Schurr,  &  Oh,  1987).  Customers  typically  interact  with  the  same  staff  for  the  identification, 
placement, and management of multiple temporary employees. Over the course of this relationship, they 
develop an understanding of each others’ contexts, capabilities, and vulnerabilities and become uniquely 
suited  to  meet  each  others’  needs  (Druker  &  Stanworth,  2004).  In  addition,  over  the  long  term,  both 
parties  receive  opportunities  to  develop  mutual  trust  and  commitment  (Hunt  &  Morgan,  1994),  and 
establish mutually-acceptable relational norms (Palmatier, Dant, & Grewal, 2007). Staff turnover, in these 
circumstances, could lead to customer dissatisfaction due to factors such as disruption in communication, 
reduced  speed  of  response,  and  delays  in  execution  arising  from  disruption  of  the  firm’s  operations 
amongt others. 

While it can be argued that voluntary and involuntary turnover have different etiologies (Chatman, 
1991; Mitchell et al., 2001; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998), they tend to have similar effects on 
firm-customer relationships (Bendapudi & Leone, 2002). Organizational units that experience higher rates 
of employee attrition are less likely to anticipate and deliver high-quality service (Hausknect et al., 2009) 
because their employees lack the critical knowledge, skills, abilities, and customer relationships, unlike 
organizations with lower attrition rates (Kacmar et al., 2006). Consequently, customers are more likely to 
be dissatisfied with the received levels of service (Brown & Lam, 2008; Brown, Barry, Dacin, & Gunst, 
2005; Zeithaml, Parasuraman, & Berry, 1990). 
 

Hypothesis 1: The rate of unit-level voluntary and involuntary turnover will be negatively 
related to customer satisfaction. 

 
Customer Satisfaction and Unit Financial Performance 

Current  literature  demonstrates  the  positive  effects  of  customer  satisfaction  on  key  customer 
behaviors (Szymanski & Henard, 2001). Satisfied customers are likely to continue buying from the firm 
in  spite  of  viable  alternatives  (Gustafsson,  Johnson,  &  Roos,  2005),  strongly  identify  with  the  firm 
(Homburg, Wieseke, & Hoyer, 2009), and be more tolerant of service transgressions (Grégoire, Tripp, & 
Legoux,  2009). These behaviors  have  been  found to  improve  firm-level  performance  through  two  key 
routes. First, as a consequence of customer retention and loyalty, firms with higher levels of customer 
satisfaction  enjoy  greater  revenue  growth  and  profitability  than  firms  with  lower  levels  of  customer 
satisfaction  (Anderson,  Fornell,  &  Lehmann,  1994;  Smith  &  Wright,  2004).  Second,  customers’ 
propensity  to  stay  with  the  firm  and  provide  positive  word-of-mouth  reduces  the  need  to  attract  more 
customers, which leads to a reduction in marketing and promotion expenses (Luo & Homburg, 2007). In 
sum, customer satisfaction with the firm should enhance revenues and decrease expenses such that we 
would expect higher levels of net operating profit. 

Because net operating profit per unit could vary dramatically by the number of staff within the unit, 
we utilize net operating profits divided by the number of full-time employees per unit (NOP/EE), as the 
measure  of  unit-level  financial  performance.  This  measure  is  similar  to  labor  productivity  because  it 
provides an estimate of per-employee contribution in the unit. It has an additional advantage as it controls 
for one of the unit’s largest operating expenses (labor cost), making it ideal for service businesses such as 
THS (Barber & Strack, 2005; Bryan, 2007). 
 

Hypothesis  2:  Customer  satisfaction  will  be  positively  related  to  unit-level  financial 
performance. 

Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011     51


 

Based on the above rationale, we propose that the detrimental effect of both voluntary and involuntary 
turnover on unit-level financial performance will be fully mediated by customer-satisfaction levels. 
 

Hypothesis  3:  The  negative  relationship  between  unit-level  voluntary  and  involuntary 
turnover  and  unit-level  financial  performance  will  be  fully  mediated  by  customer 
satisfaction. 

Recent  reviews  (e.g.,  Mathieu,  DeShon,  &  Bergh,  2008;  Wood,  Goodman,  Beckmann,  &  Cook, 
2008)  have  noted  the  relative  lack  of  time-lagged  or  longitudinal  designs  in  testing  mediated 
relationships. It takes time for the relationship-destabilizing effects of turnover to manifest in the form of 
customer dissatisfaction, which, in turn, takes time to translate into unit-level performance. Although, it is 
difficult to precisely pinpoint the amount of elapsed time for these effects to unfold, a review of the few 
longitudinal  studies  suggest  that  a  one-year  time-lag  is  sufficient  for  detecting  these  effects  (Luo  & 
Homburg, 2006; McElroy, et al, 2001). 
 
METHOD 
 
Sample and Procedure 

Our sample consisted of 46 regional offices of a THS firm in the United States. This firm employs 
1,485  (unit  mean  =  32;  SD  =  16)  full-time  staff  who  recruit  and  manage  430,000  contingent  workers 
delivering  a  variety  of  limited-term  administrative,  and  professional/skilled  (e.g.,  quality  technician, 
electronic assembly, computer programming, and accounting) services to over 40,000 client organizations 
in the US. Each regional office in this sample was a semi-autonomous unit with its own annual objectives 
and performance metrics. Voluntary and involuntary turnover data of full-time staff for these units were 
obtained  for  an  18-month  period  (from  January  2005  to  June  2006)  for  all  46  units  in  the  sample. 
Customer-satisfaction data for these units were collected in June 2007 (i.e., a year after the last wave of 
turnover  data)  through  a  telephone-survey  of  a  random  sample  of  contact  persons  working  for  the 
customer organizations. These surveys were conducted by a market-research company contracted by the 
THS firm. Responses were received from 1,956 customers (n ~ 43 per unit). Financial performance data 
(i.e., net operating profit per full-time employee) was obtained for 2008 from these units. 
 
Measures 
Turnover 

Voluntary and involuntary turnover data were reported in the form of the proportion of full-time staff 
voluntarily or involuntarily (i.e., terminations and discharges) leaving each unit. These proportions were 
calculated by dividing the total number of staff voluntary and involuntary leaving each unit and dividing 
these numbers by the average number of employees in each unit in the 18-month period from January 
2005 to June 2006. 
 
Customer Satisfaction 

Customer satisfaction with the THS firm’s operations was measured using 3 items rated on a 5-point 
Likert scale. Items included:  Your satisfaction with…“How well we communicate information that is 
relevant to your staffing needs”, “How innovative we are in meeting your staffing needs”, and “Overall 
satisfaction  with the  firm’s  service  delivery.”  This measure  is  similar to  others  used  to  capture  global 
customer satisfaction (c.f., Netemeyer, Maxham, & Lichtenstein, 2010). The internal consistency of this 
scale (Alpha = .88) was found to be high. 
 
Financial Performance 

Unit-level financial performance was measured using net operation profit (i.e., gross operating profits 
minus operating expenses) for each unit divided by the number of full time staff at the end of the year 
2008.

Control Variables 

Based on previous evidence indicating that unit-size can affect the relationship between voluntary-
turnover and customers’ service quality evaluations (Hausknecht, et al., 2009), we controlled for the size 
of  the  regional  offices,  operationalized  as  the  number  of  full-time  staff  working  in  these  offices. 
Additionally,  we  gathered  unemployment  data  for  the  year  2006,  reported  for  different  states  and 
metropolitan  regions  by  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  (www.bls.gov),  and  explored  the  relationship 
between regional unemployment rates and the other variables in our analyses. 
 
Data Aggregation 

All our analyses were conducted at the unit level (i.e., regional office). While turnover rates, financial 
performance,  and  the  control  variables  were  a-priori  conceptualized  and  measured  at  the  unit  level  of 
analyses, customer satisfaction data were acquired from the responses of individual customers. There is 
ample precedent for aggregating customer data at the unit level of analyses (e.g., Schneider, White, & 
Paul, 1998; Susskind, Kacmar, & Borchgrevink, 2003; Hausknecht, et al., 2009). Moreover, the THS firm 
itself used aggregated data for its service improvement programs. Additionally, we conducted analyses to 
ensure  that  customers  for  each  regional  office  evaluated  the  THS  firm  similarly.  We  did  this  by 
calculating  the  inter-rater  agreement  of  customers  for  each  unit  using  within-group  correlation  (rwgj  ; 
James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984), and average deviation index (ADI; Burke, Finkelstein, & Dusig, 1999) 
values. The rwgj value for customer satisfaction (Mean rwgj = .77; SD = .02) was found to be higher than the 
recommended  cut-off  value  of  .70;  and  statistically  significant  at the p (cid:148)  .05  level  (Dunlap,  Burke,  & 
Smith-Crowe, 2003). As opposed to rwgj indices, ADI values are assumed to reflect high levels of inter-
rater agreement when they are lower than .83 for items utilizing a five-point scale. In our sample, the ADI 
values for the customer satisfaction items ranged from .63 to .74. These values were at recommended 
levels and also statistically significant at the p (cid:148) .05 level (Dunlap, et al, 2003). After obtaining empirical 
support  for  aggregation,  means  of  individual  responses  of  customers  of  each  unit  were  calculated  to 
obtain the unit-level customer satisfaction scores. 
 
Data Analysis 

All three hypotheses were tested using structural equations modeling (SEM) implemented in AMOS 
13.0 (Arbuckle, 2009). Following SEM conventions, we created a latent customer satisfaction variable 
with three item indicators, as well as four latent variables for voluntary turnover, involuntary turnover, 
NOP/EE, and unit size (the control variable) each fully loading on a manifest variable (i.e., with the factor 
loading set at 1.0). Two criteria need to be satisfied a priori in order to test for full mediation using the 
SEM approach: (a) the antecedent, X should be correlated with the mediator (M; and (b) M should be 
correlated with both X and the consequence Y (James & Brett, 1984; James, Mulaik, & Brett, 2006). An 
inspection of table 1 reveals that both these criteria were met in the current data. In addition, unlike tests 
for partial mediation (e.g., Barron & Kenney, 1986), a test of full-mediation does not require that X be 
correlated  with  Y.  In  other  words,  the  non-significant  relationship  between  turnover  and  financial 
performance does not preclude us from testing for full-mediation. 
 
RESULTS 
 

A  review  of  Table  1  reveals  moderate  to  high  correlations  between  voluntary  and  involuntary 
turnover rates (r= .47; p = .001), both types of turnover and customer satisfaction (ranging from r= -.40 to 
-.47), and customer satisfaction and net operating profits per employee (ranging from r= .44 to .55). Unit-
size was found to be significantly correlated with customer satisfaction (ranging from r= -.40 to -.42) and 
regional  unemployment  rate  was  found  to  have  non-significant  relationships  with  all  variables  in  the 
study.  Therefore,  we  controlled  for  the  effect  of  unit-size  on  customer  satisfaction,  and  dropped 
unemployment rate from our analyses.

significantly predicted customer satisfaction. We also found support for Hypothesis 2 in that customer 
satisfaction significantly predicted NOP/EE ((cid:533) = .52, B=73,235; SE = 28,378; p = .001; R2 = .27).

We tested Hypothesis 3, by comparing the model-fit of the hypothesized full mediation model with 
(a) a partial mediation model where there were direct paths from voluntary and involuntary turnover to 
NOP/EE, and (b) an unmediated effects model where the paths from voluntary and involuntary turnover 
to customer satisfaction and the latter to NOP/EE were set to zero and direct paths from both types of 
turnover  and  NOP/EE  were  left  unconstrained.  We  found  that  the  hypothesized  model  ((cid:548)2  [11]  =  9, 
p=.62; RMSEA = .01; CFI= .99; NFI = .95; PNFI = .37) demonstrated a significantly better fit ((cid:168)(cid:548)2 [1] = 

54     Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011


30.9; p=.001) than the unmediated direct effects model ((cid:548)2 [12] = 39.9, p=.001; RMSEA = .23; CFI= .80; 
NFI = .76; PNFI = .33). Also, the partial mediation model ((cid:548)2 [9] = 11.9, p=.22; RMSEA = .08; CFI= .98; 
NFI = .93; PNFI = .30) demonstrated poorer fit than the mediated model and was discarded in favor of 
the  latter.  The  significance  level  of  these  mediation  effects  was  tested  by  utilizing  the  bootstrapping 
approach (Shrout & Bolger, 2002), recommended for detecting mediation effects in small and medium-
size samples (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002; Wood, et al., 2008). Following 
Cheung and Lau (2008), we drew 500 random (with replacement) bootstrap samples of the observations 
in  our  study  and  created  90%  confidence  intervals  for  our  mediation  effects  using  these  samples.  We 
report the results of our analyses using the Bias Corrected (BC) percentile method (Mooney & Duval, 
1993)  in  Table  2.  We  found  that  the  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  mediation  effects  for  both,  the 
voluntary turnover(cid:198)customer satisfaction(cid:198)NOP/EE (standardized indirect effect = -.21; 90% CI: -.35 to 
-.01) and the involuntary turnover(cid:198)customer satisfaction(cid:198)NOP/EE (standardized indirect effect = -.19; 
90% CI: -.36 to -.08) relationships did not include zero. These analyses provide support for Hypotheses 3.

Lastly,  following  the  recommendation  of  Glebbeek  and  Bax  (2004),  we  tested  for  a  curvilinear 
relationship between voluntary turnover and our outcomes by entering an additional squared voluntary 
turnover  term  into  a  regression  equation  with  NOP/EE  and  customer  satisfaction  as  outcomes.  This 
squared voluntary turnover term failed to add incremental variance in both NOP/EE ((cid:507)R2 = .08; p=.194) 
and customer satisfaction ((cid:507)R2 = .001; p=.978). Similarly, a squared involuntary turnover term failed to 
predict additional variance over and above involuntary turnover for both NOP/EE ((cid:507)R2 = .02; p=.510) 
and customer satisfaction ((cid:507)R2 = .001; p=.899). These results indicate the relationship between turnover 
and these outcomes can be considered linear in our sample. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 

The  results  of  our  analyses  suggest  that  both  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  rates  have 
statistically and practically significant negative effects on customer satisfaction. Specifically, voluntary 
and  involuntary  turnover  each  accounted  for  approximately  5%  (sr2  =  .26)  and  6%  (sr2  =  .11)  of  the 
variance in customer satisfaction. Examining the unstandardized path coefficients of these relationships, it 
is also possible to conclude that a 1 point increase in voluntary turnover is likely to decrease customer 
satisfaction by nearly 1 scale point (B=-.96; SE = .36) and a 1 point increase in involuntary turnover is 
likely to decrease customer satisfaction by nearly 2 scale points (B=-1.98; SE = .66). Moreover, customer 
satisfaction  accounted  for  nearly  27%  (R2  =  .27)  of  the  variance  in  unit  financial  performance—a 
relationship that is practically significant such that a 1 point increase in customer satisfaction translates 
into an increase of $73,235 in net operating profits per employee (B=73,235; SE = 28,378). In addition to 
these direct effects, we also found that both voluntary and involuntary turnover had significant indirect

effects on unit-level financial performance. Specifically, a 1 point increase in voluntary turnover is likely 
to indirectly predict a decrease of $690 in NOP/EE (B= -69033.55, SE= 39941.64), and a 1 point increase 
in involuntary turnover can be linked to a decrease of $119 in NOP/EE (B= -118996.34; SE= 65513.63). 
In sum, the practical or financial impact is significant. 

Our  study  contributes  to  the  existing  body  of  research  by  providing  evidence  for  the  deleterious 
effects  of  both,  voluntary or  involuntary  turnover  levels  on  unit-level  performance in the relationship-
based  business  context.  In  addition,  by  demonstrating  that  customer  satisfaction  fully  mediates  the 
relationship  between  turnover  and  unit-level  financial  performance,  we  have  taken  an  initial  step  in 
clarifying  the  contents  of  the  ‘black  box’  between  turnover  and  its  performance-related  consequences 
(Holtom et al., 2008). These findings and the underlying theoretical mechanisms are likely to generalize 
to a majority of contexts where customers interact with the same employee more than once, and where an 
understanding  of  a  customer’s  idiosyncratic  needs  is  critical  in  order  to  provide  high-quality  service. 
These contexts include many personal service settings (e.g., financial services, healthcare, childcare, hair 
dressers) as well business-to-business relationships (e.g., industrial suppliers, professional service firms). 
 
Strengths, Limitations and Future Research Directions 

One of the key strengths of this study is the use of a longitudinal dataset with time-lagged measures 
(Kenny,  1979).  Recently,  Roe  (2008)  found  that  less  than  10%  of  all  studies  published  in  applied 
psychology journals incorporated time into their theoretical framework and that fewer than 6% actually 
tested the temporal aspects of theorized relationships. This study has additional methodological strengths 
including the control of common source variance through the use of multiple data sources (Podsakoff, et 
al.,  2003)  and  the  statistical  control  of  extraneous  variables  (e.g.,  unit  size)  that  could  affect  key 
relationships (Cook & Campbell, 1979). 

However,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  a  few  limitations  as  well.  First  among  these  is  its 
generalizability—a concern in any single-company study. This research was conducted in the THS setting 
where employees and customers interacted frequently with each other and the customer had significant 
input into the provision of the service—a role that has been termed ‘co-production’ by service researchers 
(Bendapudi & Leone, 2003). In situations such as these, turnover is likely to affect customer evaluations 
much  more  strongly  than  in  ones  where  employees  and  customers  do  not  interact  often  or  where  the 
service  transaction  requires  only  limited  employee  involvement  (e.g.,  convenience-store  purchases). 
Future studies are needed in contexts where deep bonds between employees and customers are difficult to 
establish. Another limitation of this study is that we did not explore the differential effects of turnover for 
customers with varying expectations from the firm. It is possible that customers who require high levels 
of involvement with the THS firm (e.g., assistance in developing staffing plans, creating job descriptions, 
and serving as the primary staffing source) would be more dissatisfied with the depletion of relational 
assets than those who view the firm as an occasional source of contingent workers. Thus, there is a need 
to  examine  various  moderators  of  the  turnover-customer  evaluations  relationship  including  customer 
expectations and level of involvement with the firm. Further, we do not measure the specific factors that 
cause customer satisfaction to decrease (e.g., disrupted communication, delays in execution, time required 
to  build  new  relationships)  nor  do  we  measure  whether  the  impact  of  high  customer  satisfaction 
influences more increase in revenues or decrease in expenses. Future studies that drill down one more 
level would likely prove to be valuable for both researchers and practitioners. 

While our findings highlight the importance of voluntary and involuntary turnover as predictors of 
unit-level  performance,  future  research  also  should  be  focused  on  incorporating  predictors  of turnover 
into  the  model.  Past  research  has  demonstrated  the  role  of  attitudinal  variables  in  predicting  turnover 
levels at the individual level of analysis. We believe that unit-level variables such as the level and strength 
of  high-commitment  human  resource  management  practices  (Shaw,  Gupta,  &  Delery,  2005;  Trevor  & 
Nyberg, 2008) or collective job embeddedness (Felps, Hekman, Mitchell, Lee, Holtom, & Harman, 2009) 
would similarly serve as predictors of turnover. Finally, it is possible that aggregate unit-level citizenship 
behaviors  might  restrict  voluntary  turnover  levels  as  well  as  buffer  the  influence  of  turnover  on  key 
performance outcomes (Erhart & Naumann, 2004).

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the effect of both, voluntary and involuntary turnover rates 
on unit-level business outcomes is mediated by the satisfaction levels of the firm’s customers. While the 
importance  of  employee-customer  relationships  has  often  been  noted  in  both  applied  psychology  and 
marketing literatures, our study highlights the importance of retaining customer-contact staff in order to 
preserve the strategic advantage available to firms through the accumulation and use of this key relational 
asset.
