HIGH-INVOLVEMENT MANAGEMENT AND WORKFORCE

REDUCTION: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE?

CHRISTOPHER D. ZATZICK

Although interest in the workplace trends of downsizing and high-involvement work
practices continues to grow, research examining the intersection between them has
been limited. In this study, we examine (1) how layoffs moderate the relationship
between high-involvement work practices and productivity, and (2) how continued
investments in these work practices throughout layoff periods maintain workforce
productivity. Findings indicate a negative relationship between high-involvement
work practices and productivity in workplaces with higher layoff rates. However,
workplaces that continue investments in high-involvement work practices are able
to avoid productivity losses, as compared to workplaces that discontinue such
investments.

The current business environment of

rapid
change and innovation has forced many organiza-
tions to evaluate how human resources (HR) con-
tribute to their effectiveness. In the resource-based
view of the firm, investment in high-performance
or high-involvement work practices are thought to
develop distinct capabilities in employees, leading
to superior firm performance (Barney, 1991; Barney
& Wright, 1998; Lawler, 1992; Pfeffer, 1998). High-
involvement workplaces use “a system of manage-
ment practices giving their employees skills, infor-
mation, motivation, and latitude and resulting in a
workforce that is a source of competitive advan-
tage” (Guthrie, 2001: 181). However, firm-specific
employee capabilities can only be sustained if they
fit the opportunities available in an environment
and consistently generate value higher than the
costs associated with maintaining the capabilities
(Lepak & Snell, 1999). Wright, Dunford, and Snell
(2001) argued that research should examine how
high-involvement workplaces manage internal re-

sources, including employees and HR systems, and
thereby sustain a competitive advantage over time.
A key issue with respect to the management of
internal resources is the use of layoffs within high-
involvement workplaces. Layoffs began as a strat-
egy exclusively for cost cutting, but they have also
become part of a management strategy for adjusting
workforce competencies (McKinley, Zhao, & Rust,
2000; Osterman, 2000). Unlike other workforce
reduction strategies (e.g., natural attrition), lay-
offs increase a firm’s flexibility over the transition
process; firms can quickly and efficiently remove
employees whose skills no longer fit the firms’
strategies or add to their market values. Yet the
purported benefits of layoffs, such as increased ef-
ficiency and profitability, have received mixed em-
pirical support, often explained by the impact of
layoffs on surviving employees (Cappelli, 2000a;
Cascio, 1993, 2002; McKinley, Sanchez, & Schick,
1995).

Layoffs can be perceived as a violation of the
psychological contract between an organization
and its employees, resulting in decreased trust
and greater stress in the workplace (De Meuse,
Bergmann, Vanderheiden, & Roraff, 2004; Mishra
& Spreitzer, 1998). Consequently, layoffs are as-
sociated with decreased commitment and pro-
ductivity from surviving employees (Appelbaum,
Everard, & Hung, 1999; Brockner 1992; Niehoff,
Moorman, Blakely, & Fuller, 2001). Such negative
effects may be more costly for high-involvement
workplaces, as these workplaces rely expressly
on employee involvement and motivation. To
date, however, little attention has been paid to
layoffs within workplaces investing in high-in-
volvement work practices. Thus, our first objec-

tive was to examine the moderating effect layoffs
have on the relationship between high-involve-
ment work practices and workplace productivity.
Our second objective was to understand how
high-involvement workplaces can implement lay-
offs, when necessary, without suffering negative
effects on productivity. We drew on resource-based
and dynamic capabilities views to address this is-
sue (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997; Wright et al.,
2001). Dynamic capabilities are defined as “the
firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure
internal and external competencies . . . to achieve
new and innovative forms of competitive advan-
tage given path dependencies and market position”
(Teece et al., 1997: 516). This approach emphasizes
the need for firms to actively manage internal re-
sources, including people and HR practices, to sus-
tain core competencies over time. Accordingly, as
long as workplaces continue to make HR invest-
ments throughout layoff periods (spans of time dur-
ing which employees are laid off), layoffs may not
be incongruent with high-involvement manage-
ment. We argue that continued investments will
lessen perceived contract breaches by providing
enhanced support and skill development to surviv-
ing employees, thus reinforcing employees’ value
in the workplace.

This study extends the resource-based view in
two important ways. First, we examine the im-
pact of layoffs on the relationship between high-
involvement work practices and productivity.
Specifically, we argue that the negative effect of
layoffs on surviving employees may be especially
important in high-involvement workplaces. Sec-
ond, our study addresses a previously neglected
aspect of the resource-based view: the effect of
high-involvement work practices over time. Us-
ing a longitudinal survey conducted by Statistics
Canada in over 3,000 Canadian workplaces (Sta-
tistics Canada, 2004), we measure high-involve-
ment work practices at two points in time to test
our prediction that continued investments in em-
ployee capabilities mitigate the negative effects
of layoffs in high-involvement workplaces.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

A fundamental foundation of strategic human
resource management (SHRM) derives from the re-
source-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991). The
resource-based view suggests that investment in
HR systems can develop employee capabilities that
contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage
(Barney, 1991; Barney & Wright, 1998; Huselid,
1995; Wright, Gardner, & Moynihan, 2003). Al-
though a variety of HR practices have been exam-

ined in this field (see the recent review by Wood
and Wall [2001]), increasing attention has been
paid to HR practices that create firm-specific em-
ployee capabilities difficult for other firms to imi-
tate or transfer (Lepak & Snell, 1999). In this paper,
we refer to these HR practices as “high-involve-
ment work practices.”1 High-involvement work
practices cover a wide range of systems and rou-
tines. For instance, team-based production and
semiautonomous work groups increase the social
complexity and causal ambiguity of operations and
thereby develop tacit knowledge and enhance the
uniqueness of an organization’s human capital
(Lepak & Snell, 1999). Similarly, group-based in-
centives such as gainsharing can increase align-
ment between employee incentives and team-based
work (Lawler, 1992), encouraging employees to ap-
ply their skills in new work designs. Other prac-
tices, such as flexible work design (e.g., job rotation
and job enrichment) and information sharing (e.g.,
feedback), increase firm-specific human capital by
helping employees see the bigger picture of work-
place processes and operations (Ciavarella, 2003).
Finally, traditional HR practices, such as training,
increase employee understanding of their role in
the
firm-specific
knowledge. Thus, workplaces can strengthen their
HR systems and increase firm-specific human cap-
ital by investing in high-involvement work prac-
tices (including training, teams, incentives, flexible
job design, and information sharing), and thereby
improve productivity.

firm’s operations—important

Numerous studies have found support for a
positive relationship between systems of high-
involvement work practices and productivity
(Arthur, 1994; Guest, Michie, Conway, & Shee-
han, 2003; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995; Ichnio-
wski, Shaw, & Prennushi, 1997), yet few studies
examine how this relationship changes over time
(Wright et al., 2001). In particular, the assump-
tion that using a set of high-involvement work
practices and employees at one point in time will
be as successful in the future is limited; it ignores
the changing environments in which firms oper-
ate (Priem & Butler, 2001). Recently, researchers
have focused on the development of what have
been labeled “dynamic capabilities” in order to

1 We use the term because the HR practices in our
study focus on developing unique skills through greater
involvement. We acknowledge that our label could be
encompassed by other terms commonly used in the lit-
erature, such as “high-performance” (Huselid, 1995),
“flexible,” and “innovative” work practices (Ichniowski,
Shaw, & Prennushi, 1997). However, this debate about
terminology is beyond the scope of our paper.

understand how firms remain competitive in
changing environments (Teece et al., 1997).
Within the resource-based view, the dynamic ca-
pabilities approach suggests that high-involve-
ment firms “may require different skill sets im-
plying a release of some existing employees. . .”
and will need “processes to integrate, reconfig-
ure, gain, and release resources to match and
even create market change” (Wright et al., 2001:
713). In other words, firms must remain flexible
and responsive, which may necessitate the use of
both layoffs and high-involvement work prac-
tices in order to replenish the firm’s stock of
human capital. Below, we examine the conse-
quences of using layoffs within high-involvement
workplaces, as well as the potential benefits from
continuing
in high-involvement
work practices during a period of layoffs.

Layoffs and Productivity in the High-Involvement
Workplace

Given the emphasis placed on the distinctiveness
and value of employees within the resource-based
view, it is important to understand how layoffs
affect the relationship between high-involvement
work practices and workplace productivity. Layoffs
are permanent separations initiated by an organiza-
tion and implemented either all at once or phased
in over time. There are several important differ-
ences between layoffs and other workforce reduc-
tion strategies (e.g., attrition and early retirement).
First, layoffs allow organizations to strategically
control downsizing; management can target spe-
cific employees and determine the depth of the
cuts. This control is essential for a workplace trying
to adjust the skills and capabilities of its workforce.
Second, layoffs increase workplace responsiveness
to environmental change by facilitating quick re-
moval of employees who lack appropriate skills.
The flexibility and control offered by layoffs, how-
ever, come with some potentially significant costs
to high-involvement workplaces. Specifically, lay-
offs negatively affect surviving employees’ trust,
perceived control, and involvement, which in turn
reduces learning, creativity, and productivity (Ap-
pelbaum et al., 1999; Brockner, 1992; Niehoff et al.,
2001). We posit that these negative effects may be
particularly damaging in high-involvement work-
places, where employee skills and motivation are
essential for sustained productivity.

High-involvement workplaces maintain strong
HR systems by sending consistent, visible signals
to employees about their importance in the work-
place (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). Consistency in an
HR system is primarily related to vertical align-

(i.e.,

internal

alignment

ment (i.e., the link between high-involvement
work practices and business strategy) and hori-
zontal
consistency
among the practices); visibility reflects the extent
to which high-involvement work practices are
salient and observable to employees. A strong HR
system— one high in consistency and visibility—
sends an unequivocal message to employees about
their value and about the direction of their work-
place (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). Layoffs contradict
this message. The explicit removal of human capi-
tal creates uncertainty about the future of the or-
ganization, the security of one’s job, and the degree
of trust in an organization. This increased uncer-
tainty may cause employees to question their im-
portance and involvement in the organization. For
example, Lam and Reshef (1999) found that for one
Canadian hospital, downsizing (mostly through
“deep layoffs”) shortly after implementation of a
total quality management (TQM) program was di-
sastrous. The layoffs undermined many of the ini-
tial benefits achieved through TQM because em-
ployees viewed the initiative as having given them
both an “illusion” and a “false sense” of empower-
ment (Lam & Reshef, 1999: 734). The researchers
concluded that downsizing and quality improve-
ment
initiatives are “inherently incompatible”
(Lam & Reshef (1999: 741).

for skills,

When viewed through the lens of a psychological
contract, layoffs can be interpreted by employees as
a violation on the part of their organization (De
Meuse et al., 2004; Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998). A
psychological contract refers to an individual’s ex-
pectations concerning obligations existing between
an employee and an organization. These expecta-
tions are not necessarily derived from specific
promises, but rather inferred from the employer’s
actions (Rousseau, 2001). Within a high-involve-
ment workplace, the psychological contract is typ-
ically considered one of “mutual
investment,”
whereby employees exchange commitment and ef-
fort
involvement, and fair treatment
(Tsui, Pearce, Porter, & Tripoli, 1997; Whitener,
2001). A perceived breach of this contract in the
form of layoffs is expected to have negative conse-
quences for employee work attitudes and behaviors
(De Meuse et al., 2004). In response to layoffs, sur-
viving employees may psychologically or physi-
cally withdraw from the workplace—psychologi-
cally, by withholding effort and involvement;
physically,
and/or quitting
(Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998). For instance, high-per-
forming employees often take jobs elsewhere in
order to avoid the uncertainties and ambiguities in
a downsizing environment (Iverson & Pullman,
2000). This turnover will be costly to a high-in-

volvement workplace, as the departure of “high
performers” includes the loss of valuable firm-
specific skills (e.g., Guthrie, 2001). And since
organizational learning is a valuable part of a
resource-based firm (Snell, Youndt, & Wright,
1996), the loss of key employees can lower work-
place productivity.

Therefore, layoffs create numerous problems for
high-involvement workplaces, including sending
inconsistent messages to employees, lowering em-
ployee motivation and morale, violating psycholog-
ical contracts, and increasing “voluntary turnover.”
Severe layoffs (i.e., higher layoff rates) exacerbate
these effects by increasing survivors’ stress levels
and exposure to layoff victims, both of which are
positively related to role ambiguity and intent to
quit and negatively related to job security and in-
volvement (Brockner, Grover, & Blonder, 1988;
Jick, 1985; Moore, Grunberg, & Greenberg, 2004).
Furthermore, studying companies from 1987 to
1998, De Meuse and colleagues (2004) concluded
that companies that conducted large-scale layoffs
significantly underperformed, as compared to com-
panies that conducted fewer layoffs, on profit mar-
gin, return on investment, return on equity, and
market-to-book ratio. Taken together, these argu-
ments suggest that higher layoffs rates will be more
costly to workplaces that have previously invested
in firm-specific employee capabilities (i.e., high-
involvement work practices) and that rely on em-
ployees as a source of competitive advantage. Thus,
we predict:

Hypothesis 1. Layoffs moderate the relation-
ship between high-involvement work practices
and productivity in such a way that work-
places with more extensive high-involvement
work practices suffer greater effects from lay-
offs than workplaces with less extensive high-
involvement work practices.

Layoffs and Continued Investments in High-
Involvement Work Practices

Despite the potentially negative impact of layoffs
on employees in high-involvement workplaces, the
dynamic capabilities framework suggests that ad-
justments to workforce composition may be neces-
sary for firms to compete effectively. Wright and
coauthors proposed that core competencies are pro-
duced from a “combination of the firms [sic] stock
of knowledge (human, social, and organizational
capital embedded in both people and systems) and
the flow of this knowledge through creation, trans-
fer, and integration in a way that is valuable, rare,
inimitable, and organized” (2001: 716). In essence,

building core competencies requires actively man-
aging the employee mix and the system of HR prac-
tices in an organization. Although layoffs may not
be desirable (Cascio & Wynn, 2004), they offer cer-
tain advantages necessary for firms requiring work-
force transformation. Thus, a critical question
emerges: How can firms engage in layoffs, allowing
them to manage their stock of human capital
quickly and efficiently, without suffering extra pro-
ductivity losses, and in so doing form the necessary
foundation for a sustainable advantage?

We argue that the key to this issue is continued
investments in high-involvement work practices,
defined as investments in these practices that are
maintained throughout a layoff period. Such in-
vestments reflect the idea that HRM is a source of
strategic value to be preserved. Conversely, many
workplaces cut back on HRM as part of downsizing,
in a manner consistent with the traditional view
that HRM is a cost to be minimized (Brockner,
1992; Cascio, 2005). We refer to such cutbacks as
discontinued investments
in high-involvement
work practices, defined as a workplace’s reduction
of investments in such practices throughout a lay-
off period. We posit that continued investments are
critical in limiting the negative effects of layoffs in
high-involvement workplaces.

Continued investments

in high-involvement
work practices have several important benefits.
First, they can reduce uncertainty by preparing em-
ployees with skills to succeed in a downsizing en-
vironment (Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998). In a period of
layoffs, employees often face expanded roles and
increased workload, elevating the levels of stress
and uncertainty in a workplace (Spreitzer &
Mishra, 2002). High-involvement work practices,
such as formal training, information sharing, and
job rotation, facilitate improved skills and knowl-
edge, which in turn increase employees’ perceived
control with new operating procedures (Apple-
baum, Everard, & Hung, 1999). Additionally, higher
levels of employee competence can help employees
manage their expanded roles more effectively
(Brockner, Spreitzer, Mishra, Hochwarter, Pepper,
& Weinberg, 2004).

Second, continued investments in high-involve-
ment work practices can mitigate psychological
contract violations. Continuance of high-involve-
ment work practices increases the visibility and
consistency of a workplace’s HR system, particu-
larly after a shock such as layoffs (Bowen & Ostroff,
2004). Chadwick, Hunter, and Walston (2004) re-
ported some support for this argument when they
examined downsizing in 107 hospitals in the north-
eastern United States. They found that those organ-
izations demonstrating concern for employee mo-

rale and welfare in the layoff process—in a manner
consistent with high-involvement management—to
be more successful in terms of management’s per-
ception of the layoffs and financial outcomes.

Finally, employees may view continued invest-
ments in high-involvement work practices as re-
wards (Zacharatos, Barling, & Iverson, 2005) and
consistent with the terms of a psychological con-
tract of “mutual investment.” For instance, Ed-
wards, Rust, McKinley, and Moon (2003) reported
that individuals subscribing to an “ideology of self-
reliance” are less likely to perceive layoffs as a
violation of the psychological contract. Such an
ideology is more likely to be held by individuals
who view themselves as marketable, a perception
that makes layoffs a less threatening experience.
Thus, employees in high-involvement workplaces
may accept a trade-off of job security for increased
training and skill enhancement, which make them
more marketable than employees in a more tradi-
tional workplace (Cappelli, 2000b).

In sum, we propose that continued investments
in high-involvement work practices are essential in
maintaining a strong HRM system and increasing
employee skills, motivation, and involvement, and
thereby lessening the negative effects of layoffs on
employees. These benefits will help mitigate the
productivity losses predicted in Hypothesis 1.
Thus, we predict:

Hypothesis 2. Continued investments
in
high-involvement work practices lessen the
negative consequences of layoffs on the rela-
tionship between these practices and work-
place productivity. Specifically, the negative
moderating effect of higher layoff rates on
the relationship between high-involvement
work practices and productivity is weaker
when investments in such practices are con-
tinued than it is when investments in such
practices are discontinued.

METHODS

Sample

The data that we used in this study were col-
lected by Statistics Canada as part of its Workplace
and Employee Survey (WES; Statistics Canada,
2004). We chose this sample because it was longi-
tudinal and contained information on HR practices,
detailed layoff numbers, and revenues and expen-
ditures. Data collection for this annual survey be-
gan in 1999, and each year’s data relate to the prior
12-month period ending March 31. We used all
publicly available survey years; these were 1999
through 2002. The unit of analysis was the work-

place, defined by Statistics Canada as a business
location having paid employees and included in a
list maintained by the Business Register Division of
Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada selected a na-
tionally representative, stratified sample of partic-
ipating workplaces in each year. Over 6,000 work-
places participated in the initial 1999 survey,
which had a response rate of over 95 percent. How-
ever, workplaces with ten or fewer employees were
not asked about some of their HR practices; thus,
we did not include these workplaces in this study
(approximately one-third of the initial sample). Ad-
ditionally, we dropped nonprofit workplaces from
this study (approximately 14 percent) because they
did not have complete financial information (i.e.,
revenues). Finally, we dropped workplaces that did
not participate in the survey in 2001 or 2002 from
the sample (approximately 15 percent). Our usable
sample was 3,080 workplaces that completed the
1999–2001 surveys and 2,970 workplaces that
completed the 2002 survey. Analyses revealed no
significant difference in the key variables (produc-
tivity, workplace size, layoff rates, and high-in-
volvement work practices) when we compared
workplaces present in all years to those not partic-
ipating in 2001 or 2002. The mean workplace size
was approximately 42 employees (s.d. ⫽ 82).

The primary respondent was a workplace HR
manager, except in smaller locations, where the
general manager or business owner completed the
survey. Statistics Canada employed computer-
assisted telephone interviews to conduct the sur-
veys. Furthermore, Statistics Canada suggested that
larger workplaces use multiple respondents to
complete the survey, particularly accounting per-
sonnel, for specific financial information. To en-
sure the accuracy of information reported by re-
spondents, Statistics Canada conducted analyses to
identify unusual responses or trends in a work-
place, following up with respondents and adjusting
outliers or missing data when necessary (Patak,
Hidiroglou, & Lavallee, 1998).
the
Workplace and Employee Survey was very specific
in instructing respondents to focus only on their
own location when completing the survey. How-
ever, in some cases, workplaces from multisite op-
erations may have reported organization-level in-
formation and,
this
possibility in our analyses. No information was
available regarding whether the same individual
within a workplace responded in all the survey
years.

thus, we controlled for

Importantly,

In testing our hypotheses, we considered the
workplace level of analysis appropriate for several
reasons. First, compared to layoffs occurring in
other locations, layoffs in their immediate work-

place will be more important to employees. To the
extent that layoffs are distal, employees will be less
likely to experience survivor syndrome because
their immediate coworkers have not been laid off
and job security is less threatened (Turnley & Feld-
man, 1998). Second, given the potential for huge
variations in HR practices across locations within a
single organization, the workplace level more accu-
rately identified the practices in a specific location
(Wright et al., 2003). Additionally, compared to
executives in large, diversified corporations, HR
managers at the workplace level are more familiar
with their own HR policies and practices (Huselid
& Becker, 2000).

Measures

Productivity. We measured productivity as the
logarithm of revenues minus expenditures per em-
ployee (e.g., Huselid, 1995). Whereas recent strate-
gic HRM researchers have frequently measured
productivity as revenues per employee (e.g., Datta,
Guthrie, & Wright, 2005; Guthrie, 2001), we chose a
measure that included labor costs such as wages
and benefits. In a study examining longitudinal
data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Cappelli con-
cluded that “when job cuts make sales per em-
ployee rise, so do labor costs per employee, and
when the former fall, so do the latter” (2000a: 511).
In other words, a measure using revenues per em-
ployee (without expenditures) will only partially
account for productivity changes resulting from
downsizing. Additionally, to retain skilled work-
ers, high-involvement workplaces often pay higher
wages and benefits, an increased expenditure that
may outweigh any efficiency gains related to im-
plementing high-involvement work practices
(Bailey, Berg, & Sandy, 2001; Cappelli & Neumark,
2001; Forth & Millward, 2004). Thus, it was impor-
tant to use a measure of productivity capturing both
revenue generated by employees and costs associ-
ated with maintaining a highly skilled workforce.
Respondents were asked to provide exact reve-
nues and expenditures related to their workplaces.
The questions were as follows: “What was the gross
operating revenue from the sale or rental of all
products and services for this location?” and “What
were the gross operating expenditures for this loca-
tion? Please include payroll and non-wage ex-
penses and the purchase of goods.” As noted above,
Statistics Canada suggested that accounting person-
nel provide financial information in the larger
workplaces. We created three measures of work-
place productivity: 1999 productivity (a baseline
control), and two dependent variables including
2001 and 2002 productivity.

High-involvement work practices. The WES
asked questions related to high-involvement work
practices every second year, which enabled us to
measure the practices at two points in time, in the
1999 and 2001 surveys. Although the exact prac-
tices in a workplace vary across industries and
organizations (Becker & Gerhart, 1996), a typical
high-involvement system includes training, team-
work, employee involvement, incentive compensa-
tion, and communication (Guthrie, 2001; Lawler,
1992; Pfeffer, 1998). The WES asked respondents to
identify whether each of the following five prac-
tices existed on a formal basis in their workplace:
flexible job design ( ៮x ⫽ .31), information sharing
with employees ( ៮x ⫽ .49), problem-solving teams
( ៮x ⫽ .26), self-directed work groups ( ៮x ⫽ .10), and
gainsharing ( ៮x ⫽ .15). In addition, respondents in-
dicated whether or not formal training ( ៮x ⫽ .58) had
been used in the prior 12-month period. All six
practices were measured as dichotomous variables,
with 1 for “yes” and 0 for “no.” We created high-
involvement work practices bundles for 1999 and
2001 using these six practices. The mean number of
high-involvement work practices in a workplace
was 1.73 and 1.44 in 1999 and 2001, respectively,
and it ranged from 0 to 6 in both years. Approxi-
mately 40 percent of the sample reported using
three or more of the practices in 1999, and 33
percent of the sample did so in 2001.

To verify our decision to combine the six practices,
we employed the Mokken Scaling Program (MSP;
Mokken, 1971; Molenaar & Sjitsma, 2000). Research-
ers have previously used this approach in construct-
ing scales based on dichotomous HR practices (e.g.,
Gooderham, Nordhaug, & Ringal, 1999). Importantly,
the MSP allows researchers to construct unidimen-
sional scales based on Guttman’s (1950) notion of
cumulativeness using item-response theory (Mo-
lenaar & Sjitsma, 2000). In using the MSP, a re-
searcher estimates a coefficient of scalability (H-
value) for each individual practice, as well as for the
total scale. One then uses the H-coefficient to assess
the Guttman scalogram pattern by calculating the
highest homogeneity (bivariate relationship) for each
item in the scale (ranging from 0 to 1). Scales with
H-values of at least .30 are classified as having accept-
able fit. Additionally, the MSP provides a good ap-
proximation of the reliability coefficient rho (a statis-
tic analogous to Cronbach’s alpha). In this study, the
rhos for the six-item 1999 and 2001 high-involvement
work practices bundles were .65 and .63, respec-
tively, and the overall H-values were .40 and .39 for
the same years, respectively. Thus, the scales demon-
strated adequate fit and reliability to justify combin-

ing the individual practices into single bundles (Mo-
lenaar & Sjitsma, 2000).2

Of course, our high-involvement work practices
measures were not without limitations. First, they
did not directly assess the importance of employees
in a firm’s business strategy. Huselid (1995) argued
that the link between practices and productivity is
stronger if the practices are aligned with a firm’s
strategy. To confirm that the measures of 1999 and
2001 high-involvement work practices reflected a
workplace’s strategic orientation, we examined the
relationship between the bundles and the impor-
tance of employees in a workplace’s business strat-
egy. In the 1999 survey, respondents were asked-
about the extent to which “increasing employees’
skills” and “increasing employee involvement/par-
ticipation” were important in the general business
strategy of
their workplaces. Respondents an-
swered each question using a five-point scale (1 ⫽
“not important,” 5 ⫽ “crucial”). We combined the
two questions to form a measure of the existence in
a workplace of a “people strategy” (␣ ⫽ .79). We
conducted two ordinal logit models (StataCorp,
2003), with the 1999 and 2001 high-involvement
work practices measures as the respective depen-
dent variables and people strategy as the predictor.
Additionally, we included multiple controls, de-
scribed below (i.e., workplace size, industry, union
density, 1999 layoffs, and 1999 productivity), in
the models. The results confirmed that people strat-
egy was positively and significantly (p ⬍ .001) re-
lated to the use of high-involvement work practices
in a workplace. Importantly, people strategy ex-
plained more variance in the 1999 and 2001 high-
involvement work practices measures than any
other single variable in the model (the increase in
pseudo-R2 was .02 for each model). This result
increased our confidence that the 1999 and 2001
high-involvement work practices measures re-

2 It is important to note that we based our assessment
of training on whether or not management provided it to
employees during the survey year but based assessment
of the other high-involvement work practices on their
existence at year-end. We believed it was appropriate to
bundle training with the other practices for several rea-
sons. First, the MSP analyses confirmed that training
displayed a significant fit with the other practices (based
on individual and overall H-values). Second, we con-
firmed that a workplace’s training budget was positively
correlated with the other high-involvement work prac-
tices in 1999 and 2001 (r ⫽ .15 and r ⫽ .13, respectively),
providing additional support for the view that our mea-
sure of training reflected the current state of training
within a workplace and could be bundled with the other
high-involvement work practices.

flected the importance of employee skills and in-
volvement
in a workplace’s general business
strategy.

A second limitation of

the high-involvement
work practices measures was the inability to assess
employee perception of workplace HR practices.
Although we do not directly address this issue in
our study, other research has indicated a significant
relationship between manager and employee per-
ceptions of HR practices, as well as a link between
HR practices and employee commitment (Whit-
ener, 2003; Wright et al., 2003). Nevertheless, our
results must be interpreted with these limitations
in mind.

To test Hypothesis 2, we needed to assess
whether workplaces continue or discontinue in-
vestments in high-involvement work practices.
Given the problems associated with difference
scores (see Edwards [2001] for a discussion of this
issue), we did not calculate a simple change score
(i.e., 2001 HIWP – 1999 HIWP)
to determine
whether high-involvement work practices were
continued or discontinued. Instead, we entered the
two components of a difference score into the re-
gression model (i.e., 1999 and 2001 HIWP), as well
as the interaction between them (Edwards & Parry,
1993). This approach allowed the coefficients to
maximize the explained variance in the dependent
variable without constraints. In this study, we de-
fined continued investment in high-involvement
work practices as high levels of these practices in
both 1999 and 2001 and discontinued investments
as high levels of these practices in 1999 but low
levels in 2001.

Layoff rate. Respondents reported the number of
employees laid off during a year. We chose the
two-year period 2000 and 2001 to measure layoff
rates, as it captured all layoffs occurring between
the 1999 and 2001 high-involvement work prac-
tices measures. The survey clearly distinguished
layoffs from other types of turnover, including res-
ignations, retirements, and firings (dismissal for
cause). We calculated the layoff rate over the two-
year period as 2000 layoffs plus 2001 layoffs di-
vided by total employees in 1999. We then trans-
formed the layoff rate using the logarithm of the
layoff rate plus 1 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). Fi-
nally, we created two dummy variables indicating
whether or not a workplace conducted layoffs in
2000 and 2001 (“layoffs” ⫽ 1; “no layoffs” ⫽ 0).
These variables accounted for potential differences
in the time between layoffs and productivity as
well as for the possibility that a workplace had
multiple layoffs (Gilson, Hurd, & Wagar, 2004).

Control variables. In view of prior research, we
used numerous controls in the analyses, including


1006

workplace size (log of total employees in 1999),
workplace age (number of years operating at cur-
rent location), industry (comprising 12 dummies),
union density (percentage of full-time employees
covered by collective bargaining agreements), 1999
layoffs, and change in workplace size. Research
indicates that the positive relationship between
high-involvement work practices and productivity
is associated with certain industry characteristics
(Datta et al., 2005). Additionally, we included the
age and size of each workplace to control for the
maturity and stage of development of a workplace’s
HR system (Guthrie, 2001;
Jackson & Schuler,
1995). We anticipated union density would influ-
ence the use of layoffs, as a basic objective of
unions is to protect member interests, such as job
security and workload (Barling, Fullagar, & Kello-
way, 1992; Iverson & Pullman, 2000). We also con-
trolled for whether or not workplaces reported
downsizing in 1999. As workplaces try to down-
size, they often experience many problems and
subsequently need to do it again (Cascio, 1993). We
asked respondents to indicate whether their work-
place downsized during 1999 (1 ⫽ “yes,” 0 ⫽ “no”).
Importantly, we also controlled for change in work-
force size to account for other additions and dele-
tions of employees during the study period. Em-
ployee-initiated turnover (e.g., resignations and
retirements) and hiring and firing by employers
during layoff periods were captured in this size
change variable, which we calculated as the per-
centage of change in employment over the two-year
period ([2001 total employees – 1999 total employ-
ees]/1999 total employees). Lastly, as noted earlier,
we included control variables for the importance of
employees in the general business strategy of a
workplace (i.e., people strategy), multisite opera-
tions (1 ⫽ “multisite,” 0 ⫽ “single-site”), 1999 pro-
ductivity, and dummy variables indicating whether
a workplace conducted layoffs in 2000 and 2001.

Analyses and Weighting

The chronology of our measurement of the vari-
ables used in our analyses is as follows: we mea-
sured control variables from the 1999 survey (ex-
cept for change in workplace size); we measured
high-involvement work practices from the 1999
(before layoffs) and 2001 (after layoffs) surveys; we
combined layoff rates from the 2000 and 2001 sur-
veys; and we took measures of the dependent vari-
able, productivity, from both the 2001 and 2002
surveys. We employed a moderated hierarchical
regression model in which we first entered the con-
trol variables, 1999 and 2001 high-involvement
work practices, and layoff rate into the model (step

1), then the interaction between the 1999 high-
involvement work practices and layoff rate (step 2).
In step 3, we entered the remaining two-way inter-
actions necessary for testing a three-way interac-
tion. Finally, we entered a three-way interaction
between 1999 high-involvement work practices,
layoff rate, and 2001 high-involvement work prac-
tices to test whether continued investments miti-
gated the negative effects of higher layoff rates on
the relationship between the practices and produc-
tivity (step 4). We took similar steps for the two
dependent variables, 2001 and 2002 productivity.
To address the possibility of multicollinearity, we
centered the variables used in the interaction terms
(Aiken & West, 1991); variance inflation factors
were below 2 in all models, well below the gener-
ally accepted threshold of 10 (Cohen, Cohen, West,
& Aiken, 2003).

We used weights established by Statistics Canada
to ensure that the sample did not overrepresent
workplaces from a particular stratum (i.e., region,
size, or industry) (Patak et al., 1998). We calculated
the weights using the inverse of the probability of
selection and employed these weights in calculat-
ing all results presented below.

RESULTS

We present the descriptive statistics and regres-
sion models in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. In step
1, 1999 high-involvement work practices are not
related to productivity in 2001 or 2002.3 In step 2,
the interaction between 1999 high-involvement
work practices and layoff rate is negative and sig-
nificant for 2001 (p ⬍ .10) and 2002 (p ⬍ .05)
productivity. Following the procedures outlined by
Aiken and West (1991) , we plotted the relationship
between 1999 high-involvement work practices
and productivity for workplaces at low and high
layoff rates. Because results were consistent for
both dependent variables, we only show the re-

3 This finding was not entirely unexpected, given that
our productivity measures included various labor costs,
such as wages and benefits (e.g., Cappelli & Neumark,
2001). In an analysis not presented here, we defined
productivity as revenues per employee (excluding ex-
penditures) and found that 1999 high-involvement work
practices were positively related to 2001 revenues per
employee (r ⫽ .08, p ⬍ .001). This result is consistent in
direction and magnitude with results of past research
(e.g., Datta et al., 2005; Huselid, 1995). However, as we
discussed earlier, a net measure of productivity is more
appropriate for this study. Therefore, we utilize a pro-
ductivity measure of revenues minus expenditures per
employee in our analysis.

sults for 2001 productivity, in Figure 1. As we
expected, the slope of the regression line is neg-
ative for workplaces with high layoff rates and
positive for workplaces with low layoff rates,
supporting Hypothesis 1.

The explained variance from the interaction term
(⌬R2 ⫽ .01) is comparable to that in other studies
linking high-involvement work practices and pro-
ductivity (e.g., Datta et al., 2005; Huselid, 1995).
Additionally, the effect size in our study (f 2 ⫽ .01;
see Cohen [1988] for calculations) is higher than
those reported in much of the research on moder-
ator effects: Aguinis, Beaty, Boik, and Pierce (2005)
reviewed 30 years of management research on mod-
erator effects and reported a median effect size (f 2)
of .002. Although Aguinis et al. (2005) focused on
categorical moderators, their research highlights
the need for effect sizes to be interpreted within the
context of a particular sample. Moreover, research
indicates that even small amounts of variance can
have meaningful and practical effects (Abelson,
1985; Aguinis, 2004; Aguinis et al., 2005; Fichman,
1999; Prentice & Miller, 1992). We can illustrate the
impact of small amounts of variance by estimating
the monetary impact on workplaces of higher layoff
rates. We calculated 2001 productivity (in Cana-
dian dollars) for workplaces with high and low
layoff rates, with respect to a one-practice increase
in 1999 high-involvement work practices. Holding
all other variables at their mean, we found that
workplaces with high layoff rates (one standard
deviation above the sample mean) experienced a

17.2 percent decrease in productivity (approxi-
mately $4,617 per employee) for a one-practice in-
crease. However, for workplaces with low layoff
rates (one standard deviation below the sample
mean), the model indicates that a one-practice in-
crease in 1999 high-involvement work practices is
associated with a 3.2 percent increase in 2001 pro-
ductivity (approximately $1,304 per employee).
Thus, our results have statistical and practical
meaning.

Hypothesis 2 predicts that workplaces with con-
tinued investments in high-involvement work
practices will reduce the negative moderating effect
of higher layoff rates on the relationship between
such practices and productivity. To test this pre-
diction, we conducted a three-way interaction, in
which we expected workplaces with high levels of
high-involvement work practices in 1999 and 2001
(i.e., continued investments) to be more productive
in high-layoff situations than workplaces with high
levels in 1999 and low levels in 2001 (i.e., discon-
tinued investments). The findings presented in step
4, Table 2, show that the three-way interaction
among 1999 high-involvement work practices, lay-
off rates, and 2001 high-involvement work prac-
tices is positive and significant when regressed on
2001 productivity (p ⬍ .001, ⌬R2 ⫽ .01, f 2 ⫽ .02)
and 2002 productivity (p ⬍ .05). We can interpret
these results as showing that the impact of layoff
rates on the relationship between high-involve-
ment work practices and productivity depends
upon whether a workplace continues its invest-

ments in these practices (i.e., has a high level of
2001 high-involvement work practices). Following
Aiken and West (1991), in Figures 2a and 2b we
display the results graphically for the three-way
interaction regressed on 2001 productivity, plotting
one standard deviation above and below the mean
for the second moderator (i.e., 2001 high-involve-
ment work practices). When that variable has a low
value (see Figure 2a), the relationship between
1999 high-involvement work practices and produc-
tivity is negative in workplaces with high layoff
rates. The results of t-tests confirmed that the sim-
ple slope for workplaces having high layoff rates
and low 2001 high-involvement work practices
(i.e., discontinued investments) was negative and

significant (b ⫽ –.01, p ⬍ .001). However, when
2001 high-involvement work practices are high (see
Figure 2b), the relationship between 1999 high-
involvement practices and productivity is positive
in workplaces with high layoff rates (simple slope:
b ⫽ .003, p ⬍ .05). In other words, workplaces that
maintained high levels of high-involvement work
practices in 1999 and 2001 (Figure 2b) mitigated
the negative moderating effect of high layoff rates
on the relationship between high-involvement
work practices and productivity, but workplaces
that discontinued investment (i.e., high levels in
1999 and low levels in 2001; see Figure 2a) in-
curred the negative effect. Finally, we graphed the
results for 2002 productivity and found similar, but

weaker, relationships. Overall, these findings sup-
port Hypothesis 2.

To obtain the three-way interaction results, we
calculated the dollar change in 2001 productivity
for workplaces having high layoff rates and contin-
ued investments in high-involvement work prac-
tices; the model indicates a 4.7 percent increase in
productivity of approximately $745 per employee
for a one-practice increase in 1999 high-involve-
ment work practices. In contrast, workplaces hav-
ing high layoff rates and discontinued investments
in these practices experienced a 22.5 percent de-
cline in productivity, or approximately $3,019 per
employee for a one-practice increase over their
1999 level. These results indicate that continued
investments in high-involvement work practices do
lessen the negative effects of higher layoff rates on
the relationship between such practices and
productivity.

DISCUSSION

Our first objective in this study was to gain un-
derstanding of the impact of layoffs on the relation-
ship between high-involvement work practices and
workplace productivity. We predicted that work-
places with more high-involvement work practices
suffer greater negative effects from layoffs than
workplaces with fewer such practices. The results
provide support for the hypothesized interaction,
suggesting
that high-involvement workplaces
threaten their competitive advantage through peo-
ple when conducting layoffs. Our second objective
was to understand how high-involvement work-
places could use layoffs, when necessary, without

experiencing negative effects on productivity. Im-
portantly, we found that workplaces with contin-
ued investments in high-involvement work prac-
tices mitigated the negative effects of layoffs on the
relationship between the practices and productiv-
ity. We discuss the implications of our findings
below.

We extend the resource-based view of the firm by
considering how workplaces manage their work-
force and HR practices. The complexity of the link
between such management and productivity is ev-
idenced by the presence of two- and three-way
interactions but absence of main effects for high-
involvement work practices. The dynamic capabil-
ities framework helps explain these findings with
the proposal that firms use a combination of high-
involvement work practices and layoffs to remain
flexible and responsive to their changing environ-
ments. Although layoffs may not be the first option
for managing workforce capabilities, our results do
suggest that layoffs may be tolerable within high-
involvement workplaces, as long as investments in
high-involvement work practices are continued
during layoff periods. This finding is consistent
with Lepak and Snell’s (1999) contention that firms
need to use multiple employment modes to capi-
talize on different market opportunities: As em-
ployee value and uniqueness change over time, so
must an organization’s employment strategies.
Lepak and Snell (2002) found that firms simulta-
neously internalized employees who added both
uniqueness and value and contracted out work for
which employees no longer added market value.
Our results indicate that layoffs are one mechanism
that high-involvement workplaces may use to bal-

ance multiple employment modes in response to
market demands.

These findings are consistent with previous
downsizing research, suggesting that layoffs are
more successful when they are part of a strategic or
planned change, rather than when they are part of
cost-cutting by the workplace (Cameron, Freeman,
& Mishra, 1993; Freeman, 1999; Worrell, Davidson,
& Sharma, 1991). Although we could not verify
workplace change strategy, it is likely that firms
that maintain high levels of high-involvement work

practices before and after layoffs are engaged in
strategic reorientation but that firms reducing high-
involvement work practices are not. Because lay-
offs breach the psychological contract between a
workplace and its employees (Cascio & Wynn,
2004; De Meuse et al., 2004), it is essential for the
workplace to avoid cutting high-involvement work
practices during reorganization. When combined
with layoffs, such cutbacks provide inconsistent
messages to employees in a high-involvement
workplace (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004). Rather, firms


2006

Zatzick and Iverson

1011

must continue investments in employees, such as
training and job enrichment, to accommodate new
ways of operating (Brockner, 1992; Cascio & Wynn,
2004). This “reinvestment” is needed to prepare
employees for future roles recognizing their value
to the workplace.

Our study therefore also contributes to the grow-
ing research on employee-organization linkages
(Shore & Coyle-Shapiro, 2003; Tsui et al., 1997;
Whitener, 2001). Through additional economic and
social exchanges, workplaces gain flexibility in the
management of their workforces by investing in
high-involvement work practices. Such invest-
ments help improve employees’ skills, knowledge,
experience, and marketability. In exchange, em-
ployees will continue to produce during periods of
workforce reduction. Of course, future research is
needed at the individual level to assess how em-
ployees view the trade-off between reduced job se-
curity and increased investment in their human
capital.

Several

important

limitations of

the present
study merit discussion. First, the possibility of
common method bias exists. However, this possi-
bility was minimized by various factors in the re-
search design, including the use of longitudinal
data, whereby productivity was measured two and
three years following the 1999 high-involvement
work practices measure. Additionally, our depen-
dent variable, productivity, was based on financial
information provided by the respondents and was
therefore less prone to the influence of implicit
models held by respondents than subjective mea-
sures based on attitudes and perceptions (Podsa-
koff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). It is pref-
erable for financial information to come directly
from an independent, objective source, and it may
be that the respondents did consult organization
records or accounting personnel when completing
the survey. Statistics Canada encouraged respon-
dents to have financial personnel complete appro-
priate questions, particularly in larger workplaces
with separate financial departments. Finally, it is
possible that the primary respondents were differ-
ent in each of the survey years; although specific
information on the frequency of such variation was
not available, Statistics Canada confirmed that it
did occur for some workplaces. Thus, the presence
of two-way and three-way interaction effects is not
likely a result of common method bias.

Second, our use of dichotomous measures indi-
cating the existence of a formal HR practice was a
limitation. We could not assess the actual usage of
high-involvement work practices, nor could we
identify whether the practices were available to all
employees or only to a subset. However, unlike

many previous researchers using dichotomous
measures, we did verify the decision to combine
the practices into a single index using the Mokken
Scaling Program, which allowed us to calculate a
measure of reliability (rho), confirming the fit
among the practices in our high-involvement work
practices bundles. Additionally, as we discussed
earlier, we did confirm that the presence of a bun-
dle of HR practices was significantly related to the
importance of employees in a workplace’s business
strategy—that is, it was likely to be a “people
strategy.”

A third limitation was the lack of measures of
employee perceptions of high-involvement work
practices and layoffs. Numerous studies have high-
lighted the negative employee perceptions associ-
ated with layoffs, but few have examined their role
within a high-involvement workplace. There is a
need for future research that assesses how employ-
ees view downsizing within the context of a high-
involvement workplace, particularly with regard to
the trade-off of job security for skills and training.
Finally, we did not have information on high-in-
volvement work practices during the period in
which we measured layoffs (i.e., 2000). Instead, we
inferred that workplaces with high levels of high-
involvement work practices in 1999 and 2001
maintained the practices in 2000. Future research
should address the possibility that high-involve-
ment work practices fluctuate year-to-year, as well
as the consequences of such fluctuations on em-
ployee capabilities and workplace productivity.

It is also essential to consider whether our focus
on Canadian workplaces limits the generalizability
of our findings. Geographical context may be im-
portant, as Canada has a bigger “safety net” than
some other countries. For instance, Canadian law
requires severance pay commensurate with an in-
dividual’s length of service (called “reasonable no-
tice”). Additionally, Canada guarantees basic
health care for residents, which minimizes some of
the pain of unemployment. This safety net may
make it possible for high-involvement workplaces
to “justify” the decision to lay off employees. Thus,
future research is required to verify that our find-
ings are generalizable to other countries, particu-
larly in countries such as the United States, where
the safety net is more limited than Canada’s and
termination benefits are thus more important (e.g.,
Chadwick et al., 2004).

These limitations are inherent in using data col-
lected as part of large government surveys (Godard,
2001). Yet use of these data to test our hypotheses
had many strengths. First, we had longitudinal data
with which to test the relationship between high-
involvement work practices and workplace perfor-

mance. Typically, research has relied on retrospec-
tive questions or contemporaneous data to link HR
practices to performance (Wright et al., 2003). Sec-
ond, the data represented a nationally representa-
tive stratified sample of workplaces in Canada, a
fact that reduced biases from workplaces being se-
lected or omitted from the sample. Finally, we were
able to measure high-involvement work practices at
two points in time, a rarity in similar research.

Understanding the relationship between high-
involvement work practices and layoffs is essential
for HR managers. Layoffs have become an accepted
business practice and are viewed as an important
tool with which management guides organizations
through changing business environments (McKin-
ley et al., 2000). Yet evidence to indicate that lay-
offs do not
improve performance continues to
mount. We extend this finding to include work-
places that have made investments in firm-specific
human capital. Prior investments in high-involve-
ment work practices do not continue to motivate
employees to remain productive. Rather, manage-
ment must continue to invest in high-involvement
work practices during downsizing. Our results mir-
ror the observation by Pfeffer that “even for firms
[needing]
to reduce the number of employees,
downsizing can be accomplished while still treat-
ing people as important assets and maintaining mo-
rale and trust” (1998: 186) and, therefore, maintain-
ing productivity.
