 In this study, we investigated the relationship between organization-level compensa-
 tion decisions and organizational performance. Specifically, we examined how com-
 panies' pay structures and pay levels relate to resource efficiency, patient care out-
 comes, and financial performance. We expected both nonlinear and interactive effects.
 Results from a large database of hospitals support our predictions. We discuss the
 implications for practice and compensation research theory development in light of
 the study's results.

 Human resource management practices in gen-
 eral (e.g., Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Becker & Huselid,
 1998; Huselid & Becker, 2000), and compensation
 systems in particular (Banker, Lee, Potter, & Srini-
 vasan, 1996; Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Becker &
 Huselid, 1998; Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2002), have
 been shown to be highly related to organizational
 performance. Considering the importance and com-
 plexities of compensation issues, though, more re-
 search on the organizational performance implica-
 tions of specific practices is still needed (Becker &
 Gerhart, 1996; Becker & Huselid, 1998; Bloom,
 1999; Bloom & Michel, 2002). The purpose of this
 study was to investigate the relationship between
 pay level, pay structure, and various measures of
 organizational performance.

 Pay Level

 discuss how both pay characteristics operate simul-
 taneously to affect organizational outcomes. We ex-
 amined the independent and interactive effects of
 these compensation elements on three types of or-
 ganizational outcomes: resource efficiency (here,
 the average length of a hospital patient's stay), pa-
 tient care outcomes (adjusted coronary survival
 rate), and organizational financial performance (re-
 turn on assets). We tested our hypotheses using a
 sample of 333 short-stay acute care hospitals.

 ORGANIZATIONAL PAY CHARACTERISTICS

 Pay level represents a firm's average compensa-

 Both theory and empirical research suggest that
 pay level and pay structure are each important for
 understanding the organization-level implications
 of pay policy. Furthermore, as any pay system is
 characterized by both elements, it is essential to

 tion relative to that of other, competing organiza-
 tions (Gerhart & Milkovich, 1992), and is often la-
 beled as leading, matching, or "lagging" the market
 (Milkovich & Newman, 2002). An organization
 with a policy of leading the market offers higher
 than the average wage of the relevant labor market;
 a policy of lagging the market signifies lower-than-
 market-average wages, and a policy of matching the
 market indicates wages at the relevant labor market
 average.

 Efficiency wage theory helps explain how pay
 levels relate to organizational performance (Akerlof
 & Yellen, 1986). Organizations with higher pay lev-
 els should experience increases in both individual-
 level and organization-level efficiency because
 they are more able to attract, retain, and motivate

 the best performers. High pay levels generate larger
 applicant pools, which allow organizations to be
 more selective when hiring (Williams & Dreher,
 1992) and to retain highly qualified employees (Ak-
 erlof & Yellen, 1986; Campbell, 1993). High pay
 levels may also improve employee and resource
 efficiency by decreasing employees' unproduc-
 tive behaviors (Akerlof & Yellen, 1986). We thus
 predict:

 indicates a compressed pay distribution, or as hi-
 erarchical, which indicates more widely dispersed
 pay.

 Equity theory has been used to investigate the
 performance effects of organizational pay struc-
 tures. According to equity theory, employees eval-
 uate "exchange relationships" on the basis of com-
 parisons of their perceived ratios of inputs and
 outputs to the perceived ratios of others' inputs and
 outputs (Adams, 1965). When employees perceive
 inequity (for instance, they see themselves as work-
 ing harder than, but receiving less pay than, co-
 workers), they may respond with a host of poten-
 tially negative reactions in order to restore equity in
 their exchange relationships. As it has been most
 typically applied, equity theory suggests that
 overly hierarchical pay structures can have dys-
 functional consequences. As pay structures become
 too hierarchical, organizational performance may
 be adversely influenced because employees will
 become less cooperative and less inclined toward
 teamwork (Adams, 1965; Bloom, 1999; Pfeffer &
 Langton, 1993; Main, O'Reilly, & Wade, 1993).
 These negative consequences may be exacerbated if
 a hierarchical structure becomes a means of signal-
 ing organizational value, spawning feelings of so-
 cial, psychological, and economic injustice among
 employees (Bloom, 1999). While overly hierarchi-
 cal pay systems should be associated with negative
 organizational outcomes, equity theory also sug-
 gests that overly egalitarian pay structures will be
 similarly detrimental. Greater levels of knowledge,
 skills, and abilities should be associated with
 greater pay; thus, pay systems that provide insuffi-
 cient differences for human capital could also yield
 feelings of inequity on the parts of those with
 greater levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities.

 Hypothesis 3. Organizational performance (re-
 source efficiency, patient care outcomes, and
 financial performance) will have an inverted
 U-shaped relationship with the degree of hier-
 archy in a pay structure.

 Hypothesis 1. There will be a positive relation-
 ship between pay levels and resource effi-
 ciency and a positive relationship between pay
 levels and patient care outcomes.

 Although enhanced resource efficiency and pa-

 tient care outcomes should be associated with im-
 proved financial performance, at some point, the
 increased costs associated with paying higher com-
 pensation will outweigh the efficiency and perfor-
 mance benefits of higher pay levels. Although the
 efficiency wage theory prediction is that higher pay
 improves attraction, retention, and motivation,
 there are limits to the extents to which selection
 can be improved (owing to limits in validity and
 selection ratios), turnover can be reduced, and mo-
 tivation can be affected by pay. Consider an ex-
 treme example: We would expect that paying
 nurses at above-market levels would lead to im-
 proved organizational outcomes, but the organiza-
 tional benefits of paying nurses a million dollars
 each will certainly not overcome the extreme effect
 of such a policy on costs. We therefore expect that
 leading the market by too much should be associ-
 ated with negative financial performance. There-
 fore, we predict:

 Hypothesis 2. There will be an inverted
 U-shaped relationship between pay levels and
 an organization's financial performance: fi-
 nancial performance will be lower with low
 pay levels and lower with high pay levels.

 Pay Structures

 In addition to a mean level of pay, an organiza-
 tional pay plan is also characterized by its pay
 structures, a term for the array of pay rates within
 the organization and representing the degree of
 slope in its pay policies (Milkovich & Newman,
 2002). Characteristics of a particular pay structure
 include the number of levels in the structure, the
 size of the pay differentials between each level in
 the structure, and the rate at which employees can
 progress through each level in the structure (Ger-
 hart & Milkovich, 1992). Pay structures can be
 broadly characterized as egalitarian, a term that

 Considering Pay Levels and Pay Structure
 Simultaneously

 Previous studies of compensation have typically
 emphasized only one component of pay (e.g.,
 Bloom, 1999; Bloom & Michel, 2002; Klaas &
 McClendon, 1996). Yet, because pay level and pay
 structure are both essential characteristics of a com-
 pensation system, it is important to consider them
 simultaneously in order to relate pay policy to or-
 ganizational outcomes. Shaw, Gupta, and Delery
 (2002) found that pay dispersion was neither inher-

 ently functional nor dysfunctional, but that its ef-
 fectiveness depended on other situational factors.
 We argue that pay level should be examined as one
 of these factors.

 efit accruing to egalitarian structures when
 they lag the market, and to hierarchical struc-
 tures when they lead the market.

 Frank's (1985) work on employees' relative
 standing suggests that workers may be more likely
 to accept perceived inequality when they are paid
 above their "marginal products," a term denoting
 the value of their organizational contributions. In
 overly hierarchical pay structures, lower-level em-
 ployees may have feelings of inequity because of
 their comparatively low pay. High pay levels may
 alleviate these feelings of inequity (Bloom &
 Michel, 2002). Thus, the effects of particular pay
 structures on employee behaviors, exhibited
 through resource efficiency and patient care out-
 comes, should depend upon pay level. Specifically,
 we expect to observe that the negative effects of
 nonegalitarian pay structures will become smaller
 as pay levels increase, and thus that egalitarian and
 hierarchical pay systems will perform comparably
 at high pay levels. Thus,

 Hypothesis 4. The relationship between pay
 structure and resource efficiency will be mod-
 erated by pay level: pay structure will be less
 strongly related to resource efficiency at higher
 pay levels.

 Hypothesis 5. The relationship between pay
 structure and patient care outcomes will be
 moderated by pay level: pay structure will be
 less strongly related to patient care outcomes
 at higher pay levels.

 Interactive effects on financial performance are
 somewhat harder to predict. The negative conse-
 quences of an overly egalitarian or hierarchical pay
 system should be offset somewhat by higher pay
 levels; however, we must also consider the cost
 implications of leading versus lagging the market.
 Although an overly egalitarian pay structure would
 be expected to be associated with negative resource
 efficiency and patient care outcomes, a company
 should save the most financial resources when lag-
 ging the market with an egalitarian structure. Thus,
 we expect higher financial performance in egalitar-
 ian structures that lag the market than in egalitarian
 structures that lead it. At the same time, leading
 the market with a hierarchical pay system should
 gain the benefits implied by efficiency wage theory,
 and leading the market should offset the detriments
 of an overly hierarchical pay system. Thus, we
 predict:

 Hypothesis 6. The relationship between pay
 structure and financial performance will be
 moderated by pay level, with the greatest ben-

 METHODS

 Sample

 We employed data from the population of short-
 term-stay, acute care, general hospitals in the state
 of California. These are facilities with average
 lengths of stay less of than 30 days that provide a
 comprehensive range of services (Office of State-
 wide Health Planning and Development [OSHPD],
 1991). We drew the data from state-mandated
 annual hospital disclosure reports provided to
 OSHPD from 1991 to 1999. Of the 354 hospitals
 that identified themselves as short-term-stay, acute
 care general hospitals, we excluded approximately
 6 percent because they showed extreme values on
 some variables (values more than five standard de-
 viations from the mean on the variable of interest).
 A qualitative review indicated that these outliers
 might have been consequences of coding mistakes
 or inappropriate classifications (that is, the facili-
 ties were not acute care hospitals), and so we elim-
 inated affected facilities to ensure a more accurate
 sample. We analyzed the resulting sample of 333
 hospitals. Jobs in each hospital were grouped into
 nine categories, with definitions mandated by Cal-
 ifornia statutes: physicians, nonphysician medical
 practitioners, managers and supervisors, techni-
 cians and specialists, registered nurses, licensed
 vocational nurses, aides and orderlies, clerical and
 other administrative staff, and environmental and
 food service staff.

 Hospitals present a valuable opportunity for
 studying the organizational performance effects of
 compensation practices for several reasons. First,
 over 50 percent of their expenditures are devoted to
 salaries and benefits (American Hospital Associa-
 tion, 1993; Langland-Orban, Gapenski, & Vogel,
 1996), and we could expect notable variance in
 how hospitals used pay to compete for employees.
 Second, these hospitals all competed for similar
 human capital, which allowed us to make pay com-
 parisons across organizations. Furthermore, a focus
 on short-term acute care hospitals eliminated con-
 founds associated with sampling different types of
 services, clients, or employees. Third, we had con-
 fidence in the similarity of job categories across
 organizations because of the highly structured re-
 porting format required for certain jobs (nursing,
 for instance) by the State of California. Fourth, hos-
 pitals employ professionals and nonprofessionals,
 allowing us to include both in this study to repre-

 sent organization-wide pay strategy and structure,
 rather than focus on only a subset of employees, as
 studies of pay dispersion have typically done (e.g.,
 Bloom, 1999; Bloom & Michel, 2002; Shaw et al.,
 2002).

 Dependent Variables

 Resource efficiency. To represent the efficiency

 with which each organization used its resources,
 we applied a metric of hospital efficiency common
 in research on health care management: average
 length of stay. The variable is the average number
 of days patients stay in a particular hospital. As
 Thomas (1997) noted, average length of stay has
 often been used as a measure of hospital perfor-
 mance in public data reports (e.g., Pennsylvania
 Health Care Cost Containment Council, 2001;
 Fromberg, 1991; Tauble, 1990) and in studies con-
 ducted by vendors and purchasers to evaluate hos-
 pital quality (e.g., Solucient, 2000). Typically, hos-
 pitals with shorter lengths of stay are considered to
 be more efficient in their use of resources (Thomas,
 1997). Moreover, hospitals with shorter lengths of
 stay have been found to be more profitable than
 those with longer lengths of stay (Langland-Orban
 et al., 1996), in part because fewer resources are
 used for patient care. We calculated this variable by
 dividing a hospital's total number of patient days
 by its total number of discharges (MacEachern,
 1962). We note, however, that despite the common
 use of average length of stay as a measure of hos-
 pitals' resource efficiency, quicker discharge of pa-
 tients is but one dimension of hospital performance
 and, indeed, good performance on this measure
 could even be considered to be counter to deliver-
 ing quality patient care. We thus also considered
 the quality of hospitals' patient care and the overall
 financial performance of hospitals.

 Patient care outcomes. One important consider-

 individual patient's characteristics, the expected
 survival rate measure provides a means of compar-
 ing patient treatment quality across hospitals that
 takes into account the different severities of cases
 observed by each hospital (Zach, Romano, & Luft,
 1997). The data on the adjusted survival percentage
 for heart attack patients were provided by the Cal-
 ifornia Office of Statewide Health Planning and
 Development in the California Hospital Outcomes
 Project (Zach et al., 1997). Comparable databases
 for other types of ailments or injuries are not yet
 available for California hospitals.

 Financial performance. We used return on as-
 sets (ROA) to measure organizational financial per-
 formance. ROA is the most ubiquitous measure of
 organizational financial performance for strategy
 studies evaluating this outcome (Venkatraman &
 Ramanujam, 1986), and prior strategic human re-
 source research suggests that ROA reflects the de-
 gree to which cost-benefit considerations of human
 resource programs influence organizations' achieve-
 ment of their economic goals (Gerhart & Milkovich,
 1990). This measure captures a hospital's ability to
 both control its expenses and use its assets to generate
 income (Lagland-Orban et al., 1996).

 Independent Variables

 Pay level strategy. We determined organiza-
 tions' pay level strategies by averaging wages for
 the hospitals' job categories. First, the average pay
 for each job category was standardized. This proce-
 dure yielded nine standardized variables per hos-
 pital (one for physicians, one for nonphysician
 medical practitioners, and so forth). Second, we
 estimated a single variable representing pay level
 strategy by computing the average of these nine
 standardized scores. Thus, positive values signified
 a strategy of leading the market, and negative val-
 ues signified a strategy of lagging.

 ation when examining hospital performance is the
 effectiveness of patient treatment. Simply examin-
 ing efficiency does not account for the quality of
 care, which may suffer as efficiency increases.
 Therefore, we examined each hospital's adjusted
 coronary survival rate for heart attack patients as a
 dependent variable. For each hospital, this variable
 is equal to its risk-adjusted expected heart attack
 death rate minus its actual heart attack death rate.
 This variable measures the degree to which each
 hospital performs better or worse than it was ex-
 pected to perform (thus, positive values represent
 higher performance). The State of California esti-
 mates an expected survival rate for each hospital
 that is based on each of its heart attack patients' risk
 factors for a particular year. By incorporating each

 We performed a number of alternative measure-
 ments to ensure the accuracy of the measure we
 ultimately employed. We computed the pay level
 using an average of wages weighted by the total
 number of hours worked in each job, but this pro-
 duced essentially the same value as the unweighted
 measure (r = .99). We also calculated the weighted
 and unweighted measures with and without (1)
 physicians and (2) nonphysician medical practitio-
 ners and again found the resultant pay strategy
 measures remained highly stable (all r's > .97). We
 also found that each organization's wage strategy
 was highly stable across all job categories. The stan-
 dardized wage scores for each job category were
 correlated from .50 to .80 with the other standard-
 ized scores. Conceptually treating each job's pay

 Pay dispersion. We captured pay dispersion us-

 mance (Gardiner et al., 1996). Profit status (coded
 here as "for profit," 1, and "not for profit," 0) may
 also explain differences among the hospitals on the
 dependent variables owing to differences in finan-
 cial structures or level of innovation (Goes & Park,
 1997).

 level as an observation of each company's wage
 strategy, our aggregate measure of pay level was
 highly consistent (a = .93), and exploratory factor
 analysis showed that the pay levels from the differ-
 ent categories loaded on a single dimension (the
 eigenvalue was 4.91 for factor 1 and 0.55 for factor
 2). Thus, the hospitals appeared to have unified
 pay policies that they consistently employed across
 the job categories.

 We also sought to control for the intensity of
 staffing in each hospital. Hospitals' staffing levels
 are measured using the number of full-time equiv-
 alents (FTEs) per patient bed. One FTE represents
 2,080 worked hours per year. Prior research indi-
 cates that staffing levels may influence hospitals'
 performance because hospitals with lower staffing
 levels may have both lower employee satisfaction
 and an increased incidence of employee perfor-
 mance errors (e.g., Needleman, Buerhaus, Mattke,
 Stewart, & Zelevinsky, 2001). We also controlled
 for each hospital's unionization status, since the
 presence of collective bargaining units may relate
 to hospitals' performance (e.g., Seago & Ash, 2002).
 Unionization ("unionized" - 1, "not unionized" =
 0) data were gathered through telephone interviews
 with each hospital in the sample.

 ing "gini" coefficients. Recently, management re-
 searchers have suggested (e.g., Gerhart & Milkov-
 ich, 1992) and employed (e.g., Bloom, 1999; Bloom
 & Michel, 2002; Shaw et al., 2002) these statistics
 for investigating pay dispersion. Gini coefficients
 can be calculated with individual- or subpopulation-
 level data (Dagum, 1997). For this study, we fol-
 lowed the subpopulation approach to calculation
 and used average wage values at the job category
 level. We calculated a separate gini coefficient for
 each hospital for each year, following the formula
 presented in Bloom (1999): gini coefficient = 1 +
 1/n - (2/n2y) (y, + 2y2 + ... + nyn), where y, ...
 y, is a sequence of the average salaries for the job
 categories in hospital j arranged in decreasing order
 of size, y is the mean of the average salary values for
 each job category in hospital j, and n is the number
 of job categories in hospital j. Gini coefficients can
 theoretically range from 0 (indicating a totally egal-
 itarian pay structure) to 1 (for a totally hierarchical
 structure). Again, we ascertained the stability of
 our compensation measure by performing a num-
 ber of alternative analyses with and without physi-
 cians and nonphysician medical practitioners in-
 cluded in the calculation of the gini coefficient. As
 with the pay level strategy measure, the results of
 the alternative calculations were very similar to
 those for the measure reported here (r's > .82).

 To control for cost of living, which may affect
 organizational pay policy, we included the median
 housing values for the county in which each hos-
 pital operated using data gathered from the Demo-
 graphic Research Unit of the California Department
 of Finance. To control for characteristics of the
 patient market, we included each hospital's per-
 centage of Medicare patients, percentage of Medic-
 aid patients, and percentage of third-party payer
 patients (third parties included indemnities and
 HMOs). These are presented as percentages of each
 hospital's total patient days. We also used an
 OSHDP measure called the case mix index, which
 controls for differences in the intensity of resource
 utilization by each hospital's patient populations.
 To calculate this index, the OSHDP initially assigns
 each patient to one of over 500 diagnosis-related
 groups (DRGs) on the basis of his or her principal
 and secondary diagnoses, age, the procedures per-
 formed, the presence of complications, discharge
 status, and gender. Each DRG has a numeric weight
 reflecting the national average hospital resource
 consumption by patients for that DRG relative to
 the national average hospital resource consump-
 tion of all patients. Case mix index is calculated by
 averaging the DRG weights of a hospital's patients
 discharged within the calendar year. Thus, this
 measure represents the average severity of the con-
 ditions of the patients treated in a hospital and
 controls for hospital costs that may be higher owing
 to more severe illnesses. Because the OSHDP did
 not start calculating case mix until 1995, we used
 each hospital's average case mix value from 1995 to

 Control Variables

 We used a number of variables to control for

 organizational characteristics, labor market influ-
 ences, and the patient market. Time effects were
 also controlled for via a dummy variable for each of
 the years of data. Ownership status-coded as 1 for
 private or 0 for public-may be related to hospital
 performance (Goodstein & Boeker, 1991); studies
 have found that a larger number of indigent pa-
 tients are treated in public hospitals, which engen-
 ders outcomes related to measures of firm perfor-
 mance (Billings, Zeitel, Lukomnik, & Carey, 1993;
 Gardiner et al., 1996; Goes & Park, 1997). Hospital
 size, measured as number of staffed beds, may ex-
 plain differences on the dependent variables, be-
 cause it may be related to resources and perfor-

 1998 to represent the severity of the cases typically
 seen by each hospital. We are confident in this
 assumption, given that the average correlation of
 case mix observations ranged over time from .90
 to .98 and as an overall measure had a reliability
 of .98.

 pay level terms in the third step, and the pay dis-
 persion by pay level interaction in the final step.

 Analyses

 To analyze the data, we pooled longitudinal
 cross-sections composed of unbalanced panel data
 from the 333 hospitals. The number of observations
 per hospital ranged from 1 to 9, with a mean of 7.2.
 A total of 2,410 observations were used in the anal-
 yses. We examined the effect of the pay policy and
 control variables at time T on organizational per-
 formance at time T. We chose to use the same time
 period for both the independent and dependent
 variables because each variable captures the re-
 sults, conditions, or policies in place over the en-
 tire year studied. Thus, the pay policy variables
 capture how employees were paid over all of time
 T, which should most directly affect the resultant
 performance of employees during time T.

 Because curvilinear relationships are easily mis-
 taken for interaction effects (Cortina, 1993), we fol-
 lowed a procedure proposed by Cortina in which
 potential curvilinear relationships are controlled in
 each model. In the regression analyses, we entered
 the control variables in the first step, the pay dis-
 persion and pay level "main effects" in the second
 step, the curvilinear (squared) pay dispersion and

 Because we had multiple observations from each
 hospital, we performed a number of alternative
 analyses to test the stability of our results. In addi-
 tion to ordinary least squares regression analyses,
 we performed regressions with (1) dummy vari-
 ables representing each hospital and (2) a random-
 effects model. In all cases, the results were substan-
 tially similar to the OLS regression results; in all
 cases, the independent variables of interest that
 were significant in the OLS model were significant
 and in the same direction in the alternative models
 (at p < .05 or better). For ease of interpretation, we
 report the OLS results below.

 RESULTS

 Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and corre-
 lations for all study variables. The correlations re-
 veal that our dependent variables capture different
 dimensions of performance, and although the rela-
 tionships (r's) among average length of stay, ad-
 justed survival, and ROA are significant (at p <
 .05), they are not very large: average length of stay
 and adjusted coronary survival, -.20; average
 length of stay and ROA, -.04; and adjusted coro-
 nary survival and ROA, .08. Note that the correla-
 tion between average length of stay and adjusted
 coronary survival supports the notion that greater
 efficiency (a lower average length of stay) is related

 to more positive health-related outcomes (higher
 survival).

 TABLE 2

 Results of Regression Analysis: Effects of Pay
 Dispersion and Pay Level on Average Length

 There were also a number of notable relation-

 ships in the data that, although not the focus of this
 paper, do merit some discussion. For example,
 unionization status was positively related to pay
 level (r = .26, p < .0001) and negatively related to
 pay dispersion (that is, to a more egalitarian disper-
 sion: r = -.05, p < .05). Unionized hospitals also
 had more FTEs per bed (r = .16; p < .0001). The
 number of FTEs per bed was also related to all three
 outcomes, showing negative correlation with aver-
 age length of stay (r = -.24, p < .0001) and positive
 correlation with adjusted survival (r = .14, p <
 .0001) and ROA (r = .19, p < .0001).

 Tables 2 through 4 summarize the results of the

 pooled hierarchical regression analyses on average
 length of stay, adjusted coronary survival, and
 ROA. Results indicate that the inclusion of the pay
 variables (steps 2 through 4) explained significant
 variance in organizational performance. For aver-
 age length of stay, the pay-related variables in-
 creased the variance explained (total R2) by the
 model by 7 percent; for adjusted coronary survival,
 they explained an additional 4 percent of the vari-
 ance; and for ROA, an additional 2 percent.

 The results provide support for the first hypoth-

 esis. Pay level is negatively associated with average
 length of stay-that is, higher pay levels are asso-
 ciated with greater efficiency-and pay level is pos-
 itively associated with patient care outcomes. In-
 terestingly, as the results in the third steps of
 Tables 2 and 3 show, these effects are nonlinear.
 Furthermore, all three models support the moder-
 ation of pay level by pay dispersion.

 Given these statistical findings, it is difficult to
 ascertain support for the hypotheses. To better il-
 lustrate the implications of the regression results,
 we plotted the relationships of the pay level and
 the organizational performance variables, with sep-
 arate lines representing the different levels of pay
 dispersion. The plotted lines represent the values
 expected on the basis of the results from the fourth
 steps 4 in Tables 2 through 4. The low pay disper-
 sion lines are represented by using the predicted
 results from the tables with a gini coefficient that is
 one standard deviation below the mean. The mean
 gini coefficient is used to represent the average
 pay dispersion, and a gini one standard deviation
 above the mean is used to represent a more hierar-
 chical pay structure. Figure 1 graphically supports
 Hypothesis 1. As pay levels increase, for all pay
 hierarchies, the expected resource efficiency im-
 proves (that is, average length of stay decreases),
 and patient care outcomes increase. Furthermore,

 as pay levels increase, diminishing returns from
 greater compensation are exhibited.

 The results do not support Hypothesis 2. As
 shown in Table 4, pay level did not explain signif-
 icantly more variance in ROA either linearly or
 nonlinearly (in either step 2 or 3). In step 4 of the
 regression, although the interaction term was sig-
 nificant and added explanatory power, Figure 1
 does not reveal the inverted U-shaped relationship
 between pay level and ROA predicted in Hypothe-

 ported. For all of the tables, in step 3 the coefficient

 significance (at p < .05). In fact, the pay dispersion

 Despite the failure to confirm Hypotheses 2 and
 3, the results obtained after including the interac-
 tion term did support the remaining three hypoth-
 eses. For all three dependent variables, the interac-
 tion of pay level and dispersion was significant (for
 average length of stay and ROA, at p < .01; for
 adjusted survival, at p < .05). Furthermore, Figure
 1 supports the specific predictions of the hypothe-
 ses. For predicting average length of stay and ad-
 justed survival, pay dispersion led to more differ-
 ences at low pay levels, but it had less (essentially
 no) effect at high pay levels. For predicting ROA, as
 expected, the dependent variable was highest un-
 der conditions of either (1) an egalitarian pay sys-

 tem lagging the market or (2) a hierarchical pay
 system leading the market.

 DISCUSSION

 In this study, we sought to investigate the or-
 ganizational performance implications of pay struc-
 tures and pay level. As predicted, our results indicate
 that pay level practices and pay structures interact to
 affect resource efficiency, patient care outcomes, and
 financial performance. Overall, our results demon-
 strate the importance of considering the different el-
 ements of a compensation plan when considering the
 relationship between pay systems and organizational
 performance. Additionally, our findings indicate the
 importance of concurrently considering pay level
 strategy and pay structure decisions.

 The effects we observed also suggest that no sin-
 gle theory can fully explain how compensation re-

 lates to organizational performance. Our results
 provide support for efficiency wage theory and
 Frank's (1985) work on employees' relative stand-
 ing. Efficiency theory was supported in that high
 pay was associated with better levels of resource
 efficiency; however, our results suggest that there
 are diminishing returns for pay's effect on em-
 ployee performance. We argue that there exist lim-
 its to how much selection can be improved, turn-
 over can be reduced, and motivation can be
 increased by pay; thus, while higher pay is associ-
 ated with our hypothesized benefits, such effects
 do not appear to be linear.

 tional outcomes are particularly noteworthy. These
 findings highlight the importance of considering all
 aspects of compensation policy simultaneously
 when determining its effects. For the prediction of
 ROA specifically, failure to have included the in-
 teraction would have led to the erroneous conclu-
 sion that compensation plan characteristics were
 not related to financial performance; only consid-
 eration of the interaction revealed the effect of pay
 policy on compensation. Furthermore, the interac-
 tion findings support Bloom and Michel's (2002)
 proposition that higher wages can compensate for
 the negative effects of inequitable pay systems.

 persion in analyses predicting all three organiza-

 ownership, and profit status across the organizations;
 however, generalizations from our results to practice
 must be cautious, because of our use of a health care
 setting and variables relevant to it. For example, al-
 though the labor intensiveness of hospitals created a
 valuable environment in which to test the effects of
 compensation policies, and although hospitals are a
 work environment where even the lowest-level em-
 ployees can have a notable impact on patient care
 (Langland-Orban et al., 1996), labor costs in hospitals
 are also a much greater portion of total costs than they
 are for many other industries.

 tems reflect an overall system of human resources.
 Although data sets like that provided by the OSHDP,
 the CAHRS (Center for Advanced Human Resource
 Studies) database (cf. Bloom & Michel, 2002), and
 Standard & Poor's ExecuComp database all have
 their limitations, they allow for sophisticated in-
 vestigations of topics of critical interest to theory
 and practice and should be used to further inves-
 tigate compensation policy research questions.

 REFERENCES

 Although our measure of resource efficiency, aver-

 age length of stay, is a commonly used measure of
 hospital performance, it is not without limitations.
 Conventionally, average length of stay is viewed as a
 measure of hospitals' efficiency. However, low aver-
 age stays may represent hospitals' efforts to lower
 costs and increase profits by prematurely discharging
 patients (Thomas, 1997). Although this explanation
 must be considered, robust findings at the individual
 patient level of a relation between average length of
 stay and multiple indicators of quality of care suggest
 otherwise. For instance, at the level of the individual
 patient, Thomas (1997) found that lower average
 length of stay indicated higher-quality care for a range
 of 13 clinical conditions investigated. Moreover, the
 negative correlation between average length of stay
 and adjusted mortality in our study appears to sug-
 gest that shorter stays were not compromising patient
 care in any obvious way.

 Finally, the inclusion of the unionization data in
 the study was important, but our measure was
 somewhat coarse. We were able to determine
 whether each hospital had a collective bargaining
 unit present or not; however, we were unable to
 collect data on the extent to which the employee
 population at each hospital was represented by the
 collective bargaining unit. Our results suggest that
 unionization is a correlate of compensation charac-
 teristics, but we found no evidence of its direct
 effect on organizational outcomes after controlling
 for the other variables in our study. We acknowl-
 edge, though, that this may be a result of the mea-
 sure's coarseness, and it may be valuable for future
 research to specifically investigate whether union-
 ization influences organizational performance.
