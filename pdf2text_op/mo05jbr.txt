Abstract

Drawing on the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm, the authors test a model of the impact of the higher order construct of
natural environmental orientation (NEO) on firm performance. Based on the literature in this area, the authors define NEO as comprising
three components: entrepreneurship, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and commitment to the natural environment. The study uses data
from 140 Australian manufacturing firms. The findings reveal that the higher order construct of NEO is positively and significantly related to
profit after tax and market share; however, it is negatively related to sales growth. The study’s practical and academic implications are
discussed, along with limitations and future research directions.

1. Introduction

Without the co-operation of industry, the world will not
grow cleaner. . .For far-sighted companies, the environ-
ment may turn out to be the biggest opportunity for
enterprise and invention the industrial world has seen
(Cairncross, 1990).

A myriad of environmental problems face the interna-
tional business community as it looks into this new century,
from the effects of overpopulation and increasing industri-
alization to the loss of threatened habitats and species. In
particular, stakeholder groups, concerned about these critical
issues and the extent to which the business community has
ignored or exacerbated them, are demanding that the busi-
ness community take action (Klassen and Whybark, 1999).
Many writers suggest that current business practice will
prove inadequate in addressing these problems (Cairncross,
1992; Hart, 1995; Schmidheiny, 1992; Smart, 1992). Thus,
not only must the business community face the challenges

of this green imperative but they must also capture the
resources and develop the skills and capabilities to remain
competitive in this new, dynamic, green environment.

As practitioners have begun to address the challenges
posed by the natural environment, so too has the academic
community. For instance, previous scholars have proposed a
variety of concepts to capture this phenomenon, such as
green orientation (Cravens et al., 1987), enviropreneurial
marketing (Varadarajan, 1992; Menon and Menon, 1997),
ecomarketing orientation (Miles and Munilla, 1993), and
corporate environmentalism/environmental orientation
(Banerjee, 2002; Miles and Covin, 2000). Nevertheless,
only recently have studies developed constructs and meas-
ures for corporate environmentalism (Banerjee, 2002).
However, the scales developed to measure corporate envi-
ronmentalism have remained limited in their operational
capacity. Although researchers have noted this limitation, no
one has systematically addressed it. In addition, the defi-
nitions have remained theoretically too broad and, as such,
there is a limit to their usefulness to managers. Therefore,
we argue that the literature in this area lacks strong theo-
retical grounding.

The purpose of this study is to propose a higher order
construct of natural environmental orientation (NEO). We
propose that this higher order construct is composed of three
first-order dimensions, namely entrepreneurship, corporate

431

social responsibility (CSR), and commitment to the natural
environment. Drawing on, and extending, the natural re-
source-based theory, we argue that these three capabilities
are rare, valuable, and difficult to imitate. Thus, successful
implementation should lead to a competitive advantage (cf.
Hart, 1995). This article hypothesizes and tests the relation-
ship between NEO and firm performance. In so doing, this
study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to test the
assumptions proposed by Hart (1995).

2. Theoretical background and hypotheses

2.1. An overview of the natural-resource-based view

In proposing our model, we adopt the natural-resource-
based view (NRBV) of the firm as our theoretical founda-
tion (Hart, 1995), which is itself an adaptation of the
resource-based view of the firm (RBV). The RBV suggests
that it is a firm’s bundle of resources rather than a product
deployment of those resources that determines a firm’s
competitive position (Wernerfelt, 1984). Barney (1991)
expands the definition of RBV, arguing that organizational
resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and
nonsubstitutable can yield sustained competitive advantage.
Such a resource will be either tacit (causally ambiguous) or
socially complex. Tacit resources are skill-based and people-
intensive (Hart, 1995; Russo and Fouts, 1997). They are
developed through a firm’s employees learning skills and
gaining experience through the repeated practice of tasks.
Socially complex resources are developed where a large
number of people, or teams, are engaged in a coordinated
action of such complexity that few individuals, if any, have
sufficient breadth of knowledge to grasp the overall phe-
nomenon (Barney, 1991).

Hart (1995) expands the definition of RBV, recognizing
that firms that are overcommitted to a specific bundle of
resources may find it difficult to acquire new resources or
capabilities. Firms must be able to respond to changing
environmental imperatives through the development of new
resources. Hart argues that ‘‘one of the most important drivers
of new resources and capability development for firms will be
the constraints and challenges posed by the natural (biophys-
ical) environment’’ (p. 989). Thus, the NRBVof the firm is an
adaptation of the RBVof the firm, made necessary because of
the demands imposed by the natural environment.

2.2. The green imperative

Although Malthus’ prediction that

the growth in the
world’s population would have catastrophic consequences
has not come to pass, concern exists that rapid population
growth will have substantial negative environmental and
social consequences (Malthus, 1966). A United Nations
study estimates that a global population of between 8 and
12 billion people could have catastrophic consequences,

such as uncontrolled spread of disease, deforestation and
soil erosion, water depletion, and air pollution (Kaplan,
1994). This will certainly create new challenges for busi-
ness, if they are to meet future consumer demands.

The complex and interrelated nature of environmental
problems will challenge the business world to move beyond
mere compliance with environmental regulations to develop
innovative responses to environmental challenges (Hart,
1995). Corporate attention will have to focus on responses
such as reducing waste and emissions, reducing and recy-
cling solid waste, conserving energy and other natural
resources, and reducing business impact on ecosystems. In
addition, firms are likely to have to develop resources
internally to compensate for the lack of available natural
resources. As suggested by Hart (1995, p. 991), ‘‘over the
next decade business will be challenged to create new
concepts of strategy, and its seems likely that the basis for
gaining competitive advantage in the coming years will be
rooted increasingly in a set of emerging capabilities such as
waste minimization, green product design, and technology
cooperation in the developing world.’’ In the future, it is
those firms that are able to secure the resources and develop
the competencies to address the challenges of natural
environmental constraints that will
thrive (Cairncross,
1992; Schmidheiny, 1992; Smart, 1992).

2.3. Natural environmental orientation and its components

Although the literature sheds some light on the philoso-
phy of corporate environmentalism, it is unclear as to which
specific activities help to translate the philosophy into
practice, engendering a corporate NEO. This study extends
previous studies (e.g., Banerjee, 2002) by proposing a
higher order construct of NEO that is composed of three
core themes, or first-order factors: (1) entrepreneurship, (2)
CSR, and (3) commitment to the natural environment.

We have identified these three core resources (e.g.,
entrepreneurship, CSR, and environmental commitment)
as resources that will give rise to a NEO rather than define
the process of NEO. Descriptively, our definition is a
starting point for examining the components of a NEO.
Normatively, it is also a starting point for prescribing an
optimal definition of a NEO, one that has the greatest
capacity to transform an organization into a natural envi-
ronmentally oriented organization. We drew on and extend-
ed Hart’s (1995) conceptual framework of NRBV in the
selection of the three components of NEO. Nevertheless,
NEO has some similarities to and differences from the
NRBV framework, which will be discussed here.

Hart’s conceptual framework covers three underlying
dimensions, namely, pollution prevention, product steward-
ship, and sustainable development. Hart (1995, p. 996)
proposes that ‘‘reducing emissions is the fundamental aim
of pollution prevention.’’ A pollution prevention strategy
aims to minimize emissions, effluents, and wastes. The key
resource is continuous improvement methods (or TQM


432

B. Menguc, L.K. Ozanne / Journal of Business Research 58 (2005) 430–438

principles) that focus on well-defined environmental objec-
tives rather than relying on expensive ‘‘end-of-pipe’’ capital
investments to control emissions. Following Hart, our con-
struct of CSR involves a proactive approach to the manage-
ment of the business/natural environment interface (Aragon-
Correa and Sharma, 2003). The focus is on preventing
environmental hazards instead of controlling them at the
end-of-pipe or smokestack. Drawing on Carroll (1979),
Wartick and Cochran (1985) characterized corporate strategy
toward social responsiveness in four categories: reactive,
defensive, accommodative, and proactive (Wartick and
Cochran, 1985). Later, Clarkson (1988, 1991) developed
the Reactive, Defensive, Accommodative, and Proactive
(RDAP) scale to describe such categories more explicitly.
The RDAP scale suggests that proactive companies, unlike
their reactive and accommodative counterparts, anticipate
responsibility of their actions by doing more than is required.
Similar to Hart’s (1995) concept of pollution prevention,
CSR focuses on prevention through continuous improve-
ment. This is achieved through higher order learning within
the organization and generating competitively valuable
resources and capabilities, tacit knowledge, and skills
(Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Finally, the scale we use
to measure CSR, derived from the CERES Principles, has
been used by previous researchers to measure a pollution
prevention strategy (Sharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg,
1998).

Hart (1995) notes that product stewardship enables firms
to (1) select raw materials with minimum environmental
hazard, (2) direct product design to minimize the environ-
mental impact of the product system, (3) minimize the life-
cycle costs of their products systems by exiting environmen-
tally hazardous businesses, (4) redesign existing product
systems to reduce liability, and (5) develop new products
with lower life-cycle costs. He also argues that product
stewardship can help differentiate the firm’s products by
establishing the firm as an early mover in green product
domains. This, in turn, enhances the firm’s competitive
advantage (i.e., competitive preemption) (Hart, 1995). Our
multidimensional construct of entrepreneurship captures
three dimensions, namely, innovativeness, risk taking, and
proactiveness. Hence, the innovativeness dimension captures
the product stewardship aspect of Hart’s NRBV framework.
We also extend his framework by considering two additional
dimensions of entrepreneurship in green markets (i.e., risk
taking and proactiveness). Consequently, if product steward-
ship is a means to end, as Hart explains, then one should also
take into account risk-taking and proactiveness in relation to
competitive preemption.

A firm’s commitment

to sustainable development

is
fostered by a strong sense of externally driven, legitimacy-
based activities (Hart, 1995). Hart (1995) also mentions that
the internally driven pollution prevention strategy is limited
in that it does not include the social environment purpose.
Thus, we have included a construct (environmental com-
mitment) that attempts to bridge these two dimensions by

integrating both the externally and internally driven per-
spectives. For instance, external and internal reporting,
environmental audits and reviews, internal environmental
reward systems, and employee training are included in the
measure of environmental commitment. Consequently, the
environmental commitment construct refers to some aspects
of TQM principles and those that legitimize the organization
to external stakeholders. We now detail the theoretical and
empirical rationale behind choosing these three constructs as
first-order factors of a higher order construct of NEO.

2.3.1. Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurship can be defined in two ways: as a social
process or as the totality of a firm’s actions (Ireland et al.,
2001). Entrepreneurship, as defined by Ireland et al. (2001),
is a context-dependent social process through which individ-
uals create value by bringing together a unique package of
resources to exploit an opportunity in the marketplace. Two
key entrepreneurial skills are the ability to gain access to a
variety of resources and knowing how to leverage them
creatively (Ireland et al., 2001). However, entrepreneurship
is also used to describe the propensity of a company to take
calculated risks, to be innovative, and to demonstrate proac-
tiveness (Covin and Slevin, 1991). In other words, entrepre-
neurship is a set of actions that may enable a firm to address
natural environmental issues. We believe that a corporate-
wide definition of entrepreneurship in a natural environmen-
tal context requires both approaches to be taken into consid-
eration equally.

An entrepreneurial approach allows firms the flexibility
to address the unique nature of natural environmental
opportunities and the challenges posed by unique green
markets. This may involve organizations being able to
respond to ill-defined customer preferences,
to address
imperfect government regulations, and to cope with uncer-
tain market dynamics (Coddington, 1993). Proactiveness
will provide the company with the necessary impetus to
identify environmental market opportunities and to initiate
preemptive actions (cf. Covin and Slevin, 1991). A propen-
sity to innovate enables firms to find new ways to produce,
package, manufacture, and market goods and services to
environmentally concerned customers and to address evolv-
ing environmental problems (Coddington, 1993).

An entrepreneurial approach provides an organization
with the necessary resources to respond to these character-
istics and, in turn, provides a sustainable competitive advan-
tage. As previously discussed, for a resource to contribute to a
sustained competitive advantage, it must possess certain
properties. We argue that an entrepreneurial approach is a
rare, or firm-specific, resource. What constitutes an entrepre-
neurial approach are tacit skills and knowledge that are
disseminated throughout a firm. They form a valuable intan-
gible resource that is difficult for others to imitate (Barney,
1991), as not all firms have the skills, resources, and will-
ingness to accept the risk presented by the environmental
opportunity.

433

It should be acknowledged that responding to the chal-
lenges of the natural environment through proactive busi-
ness management practices is not without some level of risk.
As is the case with all business endeavors, there can be both
benefits (Rondinelli and Berry, 2000) and costs (Wilmshurst
and Frost, 2000). For instance, a forest products firm that
chooses to reduce waste by using it to generate energy may
have a negative impact on its manufacturing process (a low
risk situation). This same firm may choose to introduce
environmentally certified forest products to the marketplace
and assume a much higher risk because of the possibility of
poor consumer acceptance. The general desire to avoid or
pursue risk (i.e., risk preference) will affect the likelihood of
top management behaving in more or less risky ways (i.e.,
risk propensity). In turn, the specific risk behaviors of top
managers that emerge as a result of this risk propensity will
form and shape the firm’s responsiveness to these different
risk scenarios (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996).

The final reason entrepreneurship has been selected as a
component of NEO is because entrepreneurship has long
been considered a building block of corporate environmen-
talism and ecocentric management (Menon and Menon,
1997; Miles and Munilla, 1993; Shrivastava, 1995). For
example, Shrivastava (1995) proposes that because ecocen-
tric companies should accommodate an adhocracy culture
(cf. Cameron and Quinn, 1999), entrepreneurship as an
indicator of adhocracy is likely to facilitate organization’s
ability to successfully exploit green market opportunities. In
addition, Aragon-Correa (1998) found that firms with a high
level of entrepreneurial activity will have more advanced
approaches to the natural environment.

2.3.2. Corporate social responsibility

Carroll (1979) has identified CSR as being one of the
three critical dimensions of the broader concept of corporate
social performance. Carroll suggests that organizations need
to determine whether they have responsibility for their
economic performance alone, or for other concerns as well.
If they are to accept responsibility for other concerns, they
need to decide what are the relevant issues of concern (e.g.,
natural environment, poverty, overconsumption, etc.), and
how they should address them (e.g., proactiveness vs.
reactiveness).

We define CSR as those business activities that take into
account the public consequences of organizational actions,
beyond simple compliance with government regulations
(e.g., Sharma, 2000). Thus, our definition suggests that
business should go beyond economic concerns, enumerates
the natural environment as a particular issue of relevance,
and argues that a proactive stance is necessary (e.g.,
Clarkson, 1988, 1991). Our definition is consistent with
the work of Frederick (1986, 1994, 1998). Frederick ex-
panded the CSR paradigm by arguing that
the natural
environment should be a critical business concern, and
therefore it should be included in the context of CSR. Our
definition requires an organization to adopt voluntary stra-

tegic practices such as safeguarding natural habitats, elim-
inating physical wastes from the operations, conserving
nonrenewable natural resources (e.g., oil, natural gas),
informing external customers of the environmental impacts
of products, and correcting conditions that may endanger
the natural environment (Sharma, 2000).

Some of those regulatory and voluntary actions will
require the implementation of new technologies. This may
involve higher order learning for employees leading to the
development of competitively valuable organization resour-
ces and capabilities (Sharma, 2000). In turn, this organiza-
tional learning will create tacit knowledge and skills, both at
the individual and group level, that will be difficult for
others to observe and imitate (Berman et al., 2002). Thus,
the adoption of CSR should provide a firm with the
opportunity for sustained competitive advantage through
the accumulation of a rare and firm-specific resource—
socially complex, tacit, knowledge development.

2.3.3. Environmental commitment

Environmental commitment can be defined as an orga-
nization-wide recognition of the importance of the natural
environment that influences organizations to act in ways
consistent with the interests of the natural environment
(Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999). Organizations that are
environmentally committed practice many of the following
type of activities: having a written environmental plan,
communicating its environmental plan to shareholders or
stakeholders, communicating this plan to employees, re-
warding environmental performance, and conducting regu-
lar environmental audits (e.g., Henriques and Sadorsky,
1999; Hunt and Auster, 1990; Roome, 1992). Environmen-
tal commitment also requires organizations to take a long-
term perspective to utilize policies and strategies that
support this long-term view and to allocate the necessary
resources accordingly.

that

is involved in environmental

Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) suggest

that what a
company is actually doing, or has done,
in relation to
environmental issues can describe its commitment to the
natural environment. Previous researchers suggest
that
environmentally proactive companies have top management
support
issues, utilize
internal and external environmental reporting, and employ-
ee environmental training and involvement is encouraged
(e.g., Carroll, 1979; Clarkson, 1988, 1991; Hunt and
Auster, 1990; Wartick and Cochran, 1985). As Hart
(1995) explains, it is difficult for most firms to generate
such a consensus of purpose and action, and, thus, the
shared vision and practices are rare and firm-specific
resources that few companies have been able to establish
or maintain. It is a socially complex phenomenon depen-
dent on strong moral leadership and the commitment of
many individuals within the firm. In conclusion, the NEO
(i.e., strategic intent) of an organization will be based on the
unique knowledge potential, skills, and resources that will
be given by entrepreneurship, CSR, and environmental


434

commitment. Although each of these three dimensions is
extremely important
individually they are not
enough to engender a NEO. Specifically:

to firms,

Hypothesis 1: NEO is a higher order construct composed of
three dimensions: (a) entrepreneurship, (b) CSR, and (c)
environmental commitment.

Drawing on the NRBV, we suggest a NEO is embedded
in the skills, resources, and capabilities that will be fostered
by entrepreneurship, CSR, and commitment to the natural
environment. These resources are both valuable and non-
substitutable because they are based on tacit knowledge and
skills, dependent on groups of people, or they are specific to
a particular firm (Barney, 1991). The NRBV also suggests
that the NEO will positively affect a firm’s competitive
advantage (i.e., cost or market differentiation, preemptive
moves, positional advantage) (Hart, 1995). A firm’s perfor-
mance will reflect the multiple competitive advantages that
will be provided by the combination of these strategic
resources (Klassen and Whybark, 1999).

the least

Previous studies argue that social performance, which is
highly correlated with good management practice, leads to
better firm performance (e.g., Waddock and Graves, 1997).
They reason that performing well in social arenas is good
managerial practice. On the one hand, by meeting stake-
holders’ expectations proactively and aligning them more
closely to NEO, the firm may experience increased levels of
performance (i.e., strategic intent) (Clarkson, 1988, 1991).
On the other hand, the adoption of a NEO may be led by
fears of losing external reputation when the firm’s social
performance seeks simply to avoid bad publicity. Waddock
and Graves (1997) further explain that although this social
performance is not supported by a genuine commitment by
managers, at
it requires a minimum level of
investment that may lead to better performance. The adop-
tion of a NEO will result in improved attention to the
interests of key external and internal stakeholders, as a
precursor to good quality management practice. In turn, this
level of practice may provide benefits beyond their costs
that are eventually reflected in performance, represented in
this study by sales growth, profit after tax, and market share.
These performance measures were selected because they
capture both firm market performance (market share) and
financial performance (sales growth and profit after tax).
Previous studies have only used financial performance
measures with inconsistent results. Thus, there is a need
for more empirical evidence on the relationship between
NEO and financial performance. In addition, studies on
corporate environmentalism appear to have ignored market
performance implications of adopting environmental strate-
gies. Consequently, NEO is simply a way of doing business
that
is expected to lead to positive influence on firm
performance. Therefore, we hypothesize that:

Hypothesis 2: NEO will be related positively to an
organization’s sales growth.

Hypothesis 3: NEO will be related positively to an
organization’s profit after tax.

Hypothesis 4: NEO will be related positively to an
organization’s market share.

3. Method

3.1. Measure development

We developed our survey instrument based on the
feedback received from 15 randomly selected CEOs/senior
executives and four academics. It should be noted that the
questionnaire asked respondents to recall their firm’s envi-
ronmental processes and efforts in general. In doing so, we
aimed to maximize the potential variance and avoid percep-
tual biases (see Appendix A).

Entrepreneurship was measured with a 9-item, 5-point
scale (1 = does not describe this organization, 5 = definitely
describes this organization) adapted from Covin and Slevin
(1989) for the specific context of this study. For CSR, we
utilized the CERES Principles to develop a 10-item, 5-point
scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) specifically
for this study. The CERES Principles (formerly known as the
Valdez Principles) are a set of 10 environmental management
principles. They were developed in 1989 by a coalition of
pension funds, environmental groups, and religious organ-
izations (Coddington, 1993). Commitment to the natural
environment was measured with a 9-item, 5-point scale
(1 = very rare, 5 = very common) that was developed for this
study, based on previous studies in natural environmental
management (e.g., Dechant and Altman, 1994; Henriques
and Sadorsky, 1999; Hunt and Auster, 1990; Roome, 1992).
Finally, firm performance was measured by means of market
performance (i.e., market share in dollar terms) and financial
performance (i.e., sales growth over the last 2 years and
profit after tax). All three measures of performance were
obtained from the Business Review Weekly’s (2000) annual
release of the 1000 largest Australian enterprises. We used
log-transformation of the relevant indicators in the data
analysis. We matched the participating companies with their
performance indicators. Using these objective performance
measures also enabled us to reduce the potential common
method bias.

3.2. Sample and data collection

A list of major manufacturing firms (485 firms), pur-
chased from a leading market research/databank company
in Australia, was used for data collection. The first mailing
packet contained a personalized letter, a questionnaire, and
a postage-paid envelope with an individually typed return-
address label. In addition, we offered respondents a copy of
the finished report, summarizing the research findings, to
increase the response rate. Four weeks after the first


B. Menguc, L.K. Ozanne / Journal of Business Research 58 (2005) 430–438

435

mailing, we sent a follow-up letter and an additional copy
of the questionnaire to nonrespondents. We obtained 140
usable questionnaires from the Australian manufacturing
firms, a response rate of 29%. The questionnaires were
completed by managers who were the CEO or held an
equal position.

The firms represented a large variety of sectors: chem-
icals, petroleum, and plastics (19%); food, beverage, and
tobacco (18%); basic metals (16%); machinery (14%); and
textiles, apparel, and leather (13%). On average, most firms
were large in terms of the number of employees (88%).
Seventy-five percent of firms had an environmental market
share of 1 – 9%. Fifty-four percent of firms had total annual
sales of more than AUS$100 million. Forty-two percent of
firms had an annual profit of AUS$10 – 23 million.

We tested for likely nonresponse bias by splitting the
total sample into two groups; those received before the
second wave of mailing and those received after the second
wave (i.e., nonrespondents) (Armstrong and Overton,
1977). We compared these groups in terms of the mean
responses on each variable, using a t
test. The results
revealed no significant differences between the two groups,
leading us to conclude that respondents were not different
from nonrespondents.

4. Analysis and results

Because of the relatively small sample size, we assessed
unidimensionality, reliability, and the validity of the con-
structs individually through three CFA models with LISREL
8.30 (Jo¨reskog and So¨rbom, 1996). We employed a series of
previously suggested procedures to check for the convergent
validity and discriminant validity. For example, the conver-
gent validity of the scales is supported if all the estimated
coefficients of all the indicators are significant (Bagozzi and
Yi, 1988; Gerbing and Anderson, 1988). Likewise, discrim-
inant validity is supported if no confidence intervals of the
correlations for the constructs (/ values) includes 1.0
( P < .05) (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988) and the square of
the intercorrelation between two constructs, /2, is less than
the average variance extracted (AVE) estimates of the two
constructs for all pairs of constructs (Fornell and Larcker,
1981).

The initial CFAs did not provide an acceptable fit.
Given the exploratory nature of this research and because
these scales have not been tested in the Australian setting,
we followed the procedure suggested by Anderson and
Gerbing (1988). Based on factor loading (k), residual
covariation, and modification index, we deleted three items
from each scale. The remaining items resulted in a single-
factor model with an excellent fit. All factor loadings were
statistically significant. The reliability estimates were
above the threshold (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). In addition,
except for the scale of CSR,
the AVE estimates were
the scales had internal validity and
above .50. Overall,

reliability (Appendix A). Of particular concern, however,
was the discriminant validity between the constructs of
CSR and environmental commitment. Hence, we first
employed a chi-square difference test to examine whether
they were distinct from each other. We combined the two
constructs into a single model and compare the fit with
that of a two-construct model (Anderson and Gerbing,
1988). We found that a two factor model had a better fit
than a single factor model [Dv2(1) = 47.8, P < .001]. Sec-
ond, we used Fornell and Larcker’s (1981) stringent test of
discriminant validity. We found that
the square of the
intercorrelation between two constructs was less than the
AVE estimates of the two constructs (Fornell and Larcker,
1981), meaning that
these two constructs were distinct.
Table 1 displays the intercorrelations among constructs and
their descriptive statistics.

We tested our hypotheses using a higher order path
analysis in LISREL 8.30 due to 56 parameters to be
estimated that require a sample size of 280 and more,
otherwise. Therefore, we combined the items of each
construct into a single indicator. The measurement path
estimates were set to the square root of a scale’s reliability
and the error variance was set equal
to 1 minus scale
reliability (Loehlin, 1987). In addition, no error variances
for single-item performance measures were assumed (Bol-
len, 1989). We employed individual hierarchical models for
each performance measure to better examine the model
relationships (Hult and Ketchen, 2001).

Table 2 shows that the overall fit of the hypothesized
path model was good for all three performance variables.
We found that entrepreneurship, CSR, and commitment to
natural environment loaded significantly on the higher order
construct of NEO and explained a significant portion of the
variance in the higher order construct of NEO. These
findings supported Hypotheses 1a – c.

Hypothesis 2 posits that higher order construct of NEO
will be related positively to sales growth. NEO was found to
be negatively and significantly related to sales growth. This
finding was not in the direction we hypothesized. We will
discuss the possible reasons for this unexpected finding in
more detail later. NEO was found to be positively and

5. Discussion and implications

The purpose of this study was to shed light on the
relationship between NEO and selected performance meas-
ures. We found that the higher order construct of NEO,
composed of entrepreneurship, CSR, and commitment to the
natural environment, is positively and significantly related
to a firm’s profit and market share. Our results support the
argument that sound environmental practices can be profit-
able, helping to set course for higher overall business
performance (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Shrivastava,
1995). In addition, our results support previous research in
this area that have found a positive relationship between
environmental performance and financial performance
(McGuire et al., 1988; Russo and Fouts, 1997).

Although we found a negative relationship between NEO
and sales growth, this finding is not unexpected given the
mixed findings in the literature. For instance, Jaggi and
Freedman (1992) found a negative relationship between
environmental performance and financial performance in
the short run. One explanation for the negative relationship
is that we only capture sales figures over the last 2 years.
This incremental measure, unlike profitability and market
share, requires a longer measurement period. In addition, we
were unable to capture the exact timing of the adoption of
NEO, therefore, our results are a snapshot in time only.
Some of the respondent companies may have started their
focus on environmental activities only very recently. Thus,
the reputational advantage (Miles and Covin, 2000) created
by environmental activities may yet be reflected in the sales
growth. Finally, Hunt and Auster (1990) suggest that firms
often overlook environmental management schemes because
the short-run effect on the bottom line may be negative.

As previously mentioned, this study is the first to explic-
itly test Hart’s (1995) theory of a competitive advantage
based upon the firm’s relationship to the natural environment.

Our results support the NRBV of the firm that valuable
resources can have a positive impact on performance out-
comes. Thus, we argue that firms should respond to the
changing environmental imperatives through the develop-
ment and deployment of valuable and nonsubstitutable
resources. Firms that develop the resources both to address
the constraints imposed by the natural environment, and to
capture the opportunities offered by it, are likely to yield to
higher performance.

We found that commitment to the natural environment
explained more variance in the higher order construct of
NEO than the other two components. Firms that communi-
cate the importance of the natural environment are likely to
contribute to the recognition of NEO throughout the orga-
nization and in turn increase the firm’s profitability and
market share. However, the communication of these values
is not sufficient on its own. Firms must also develop
programs to support these values, such as committees to
develop formal plans to address environmental
issues,
manuals detailing environmental procedures, employee
training programs, and supplying environmental informa-
tion in external communications.

The next most important component in the higher order
construct of NEO is entrepreneurship. Firms that have a
strong inclination to pursue high-risk environmental oppor-
tunities and that emphasize a bold innovative approach to
developing environmentally friendly products are likely to
prosper. In addition, those that have a high rate of environ-
mentally friendly product introductions and are the first to
introduce such products and technologies into the market
are likely to thrive.

Finally, CSR was the next most important component in
the higher order construct of NEO. Those firms who attempt
to reduce physical waste, or dispose of physical waste
through environmentally safe methods, may reduce costs
and positively affect their profitability. Effective communi-
cation of the environmental impact of the products is likely to
positively affect a firm’s performance through its reputational
advantage (Miles and Covin, 2000). The adoption of pro-
cesses that are reliant on the sustainable use of renewable

natural resources result in both lower cost and increased
reputation.

Overall, we believe that we have captured all of the
essential components of the higher order construct of NEO.
The relatively small variance explained (ranging from 6% to
12%) in the three performance measures may suggest
however that there are some other components that should
be included in a complete definition of NEO. Future studies
that explore the relative contribution of NEO on perfor-
mance should include other strategic orientations. This will
provide researchers and managers with a more complete
understanding of the relative contribution of NEO beyond
the ‘‘mainstream’’ strategic orientations.

In addition,

there are several other areas in need of
further research. Although Australian manufacturing com-
panies display an attractive context, future work should test
this study’s hypotheses in other countries where natural
environmental concerns are also given priority. In addition,
we only employed market and financial measures of per-
formance. Future research should include social perfor-
mance dimensions, and the impact of NEO on employee
attitudes and behavior toward their employers should be
explored. Our study is also limited in that it incorporates
only short-term sales figures. Future research should utilize
longer term sales data, which will enable researchers to
capture the fluctuations in sales caused by periodic disrup-
tions in the market. Finally, future research that employs
longitudinal research design may shed light on the causal
relationship between NEO and performance.
