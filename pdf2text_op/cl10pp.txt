Integrating the strategic human resource management research with
the multiple-stakeholder view of organizational climate, in this study
we propose that the human resource management practices of a high-
performance work system enhance a business unit’s market performance
in the service context by facilitating 2 types of strategically targeted or-
ganizational climate: concern for customers and concern for employees,
which further encourage employees to engage in cooperative behaviors
with customers (service performance) and coworkers (helping behav-
ior) that are essential in achieving superior market performance. The
results based on the data collected from multiple sources of 133 stores
in Taiwan in 2 phases largely supported the proposed theoretical frame-
work and shed light on the inﬂuence mechanism of high-performance
work system on organizational effectiveness in the service context.

The link between human resource (HR) practices and organizational
effectiveness has received much attention. A basic premise of this re-
search stream is that a system of internally coherent HR practices aligned
with an organizational strategy, rather than individual HR practices used
in isolation, may enhance organizational performance (see Lepak, Liao,
Chung, & Harden, 2006, for a recent review). The literature has garnered
much empirical evidence supporting that high-performance work sys-
tems (HPWS), or systems of HR practices that include “comprehensive

recruitment and selection procedures, incentive compensation and perfor-
mance management systems, and extensive employee involvement and
training” (Huselid, 1995, p. 635) and are designed to enhance employee
ability, motivation, and opportunities to contribute (Batt, 2002; Boxall &
Purcell, 2002), could enhance organizational performance (e.g., Huselid,
1995; Wright, Gardner, Moynihan, & Allen, 2005; Zacharatos, Barling,
& Iverson, 2005). However, researchers generally agree that HR practices
do not lead directly to organizational performance and have started ex-
amining the intermediate mechanisms to understand how HR practices
affect organizational performance (e.g., Ferris, Authur, Berkson, Kaplan,
Harrell-Cook, & Frink, 1998; Takeuchi, Lepak, Wang, & Takeuchi, 2007;
Wright, Dunford, & Snell, 2001). The primary goal of this study is to fur-
ther the examination of the mediation mechanisms between HPWS and
organizational performance. Speciﬁcally, we aim to extend the literature
in several ways.

First, although researchers have argued that HPWS could contribute to
organizational performance if the system elicits employees to behave in a
manner supportive of organizational goals (e.g., Ostroff & Bowen, 2000),
prior studies have examined either employee in-role task performance or
extra-role discretionary citizenship behavior. This study contributes to the
literature by examining both types of behavior as the mediators because
both behavior domains may uniquely contribute to overall organizational
performance (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993).

Second, the ways employees behave may depend upon how they in-
terpret features of the work environment, and organizational climate has
been suggested to be a critical link between HR systems and employee per-
formance (Ferris et al., 1998; Kopelman, Brief, & Guzzo, 1990; Ostroff
& Bowen, 2000). It is likely that HR practices shape employee shared
perceptions about the organizational climate, which in turn inﬂuence
employee collective behaviors, and employee collective behaviors then
contribute to organizational performance. Building upon the pioneering
work of Burke, Borucki, and Hurley (1992) on a multiple-stakeholder per-
spective of work climate, we simultaneously investigated different types
of climate targeted toward speciﬁc stakeholder groups. Corroborating
Borucki and Burk (1999), we extend Burke et al.’s work (1992) from ex-
amining psychological climate perceptions at the individual level analysis
to examining employee shared climate perceptions at the business-unit
level analysis. We further extend Borucki and Burke’s (1999) unit-level
investigation by examining a coherent HPWS as the antecedent of the
unit’s climate and examining both collective in-role task performance
and collective extra-role citizenship behavior as the consequences of
the climate.

Third, with few exceptions (e.g., Batt, 2002; Liao & Chuang, 2004;
Liao, Toya, Lepak, & Hong, 2009; Sun, Aryee, & Law, 2007), pre-
vious studies examining the HR practices-organizational performance
relationship have mainly focused on blue-collar workers in manufactur-
ing plants (e.g., Arthur, 1994; MacDufﬁe, 1995; Youndt, Snell, Dean, &
Lepak, 1996; Zacharatos et al., 2005), despite the fact that service sectors
account for about 70% of GDP in the United Sates (Bureau of Economic
Analysis, 2007) and dominate the economy in many other nations and
regions. This study contributes to the HR literature by investigating the
inﬂuence mechanisms of HPWS in service settings. Given that service
features are different from characteristics of the manufacturing sector, un-
derstanding the nature of services is essential to understand how HPWS
operates in a service context (Batt, 2002). As Bowen and Schneider (1988)
noted, compared to manufactured goods, services are less tangible; are
produced, delivered, purchased and consumed simultaneously; and cus-
tomers often participate in the production of their own services. These
features imply that customer experience directly affects customer satis-
faction, purchase decision, and loyalty, and that front-line employees have
a tremendous burden of responsibility because customer interactions with
them form the central part of customer experience. Therefore, HPWS in
service organizations should not only focus on employees but also consider
customer needs to achieve superior market performance in terms of sales,
market share, and proﬁtability. Therefore, in this study, we conceptualize
HPWS as being composed of HR practices of stafﬁng, training, employee
involvement and participation, performance appraisals, compensation and
rewards, and work–life balance and other caring practices that simultane-
ously attend to the employee–organization relationship (Fulmer, Gerhart,
& Scott, 2003; Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002; Tsui, Pearce, Porter, &
Tripoli, 1997) and the customer–organization relationship (e.g., Schneider
& Bowen, 1985).

Taken together, the central thesis of this study is that HPWS serves
to enhance the business unit’s market performance in the service context
by facilitating two types of strategically targeted organizational climate:
concern for customers and concern for employees (Burke et al., 1992),
which, in turn, encourage employees to engage in cooperative behavior
with customers (service performance) and coworkers (helping behavior).
Employee collective cooperative behaviors further contribute to the or-
ganization’s market performance. Figure 1 depicts the study’s overall
theoretical framework. This framework is constructed at the business-
unit level. Our unit-level analysis is appropriate on the one hand because
variances in the use of HR systems as well as employee perceptions of
such systems may exist between business units (Liao & Chuang, 2004).
On the other hand, employee shared climate perceptions and collective

behaviors may emerge via bottom-up processes (Kozlowski & Klein,
2000) within the business unit. We empirically tested the proposed frame-
work using data obtained from retail stores in Taiwan. In Taiwan, the
service sectors, which account for more than 70% of GDP, play a pivotal
role in promoting economic growth, and about 58% of Taiwanese em-
ployees work in service sectors where most of them have daily contact
with customers (National Statistics, Republic of China [Taiwan], 2007a;
2007b). These data thus enable us to assess the external validity of the the-
oretical arguments primarily derived from Western research concerning
the linkages among HPWS, organizational climate, employee behavior,
and organizational performance.

In the following section, we articulate how HPWS engenders a positive
climate of concern for customers and a positive climate of concern for
employees, which further motivates two types of employee behaviors that
are essential for achieving superior market performance.

HPWS and Unit Climates

James and James (1989) proposed that psychological climate, or an
employee’s cognitive evaluations or appraisal of the environment, reﬂects
one single, overall factor indicating the degree to which the environ-
ment is viewed by the employee as beneﬁcial or harmful to his or her
well-being. Extending this work, researchers have argued that different
climates can be formed in the same organization as a function of various
strategic foci of the organization (e.g., Schneider, 1990). In particular,
Burke and colleagues conceptualized work climate from the perspective


CHUANG AND LIAO

157

of a multiple stakeholder organization (Borucki & Burke, 1999; Burke
et al., 1992; Burke, Borucki, & Kaufman, 2002), proposing that individual
employees “may cognitively appraise their work environment in terms of
what is signiﬁcant or meaningful not only to their own well-being but
also to the well-being of other relevant organizational constituencies (e.g.,
customers in a retail environment)” (Burke et al., 1992, p.718). Burke
and colleagues thus differentiated two types of work climates and labeled
them as “concern for customers” and “concern for employees”. Using
a large data set collected from a retail organization, Burke et al. (1992)
demonstrated empirical evidence for the two-factor structure of individual
employees’ climate perceptions. Likewise, Schneider and Bowen (1992)
argued that a positive climate for customer well-being and a positive cli-
mate for employee well-being are distinct, and further suggested that “an
organization may have policies and practices that are positive in the sense
that employees feel well-treated, but this would have little relationship to
the service customers experience unless the organization also has policies
and practices that promote service excellence” (p. 8).

Following the lead of Burke, Schneider, and colleagues, in this study
we examine employee perceptions of the work environment in terms of the
business unit’s concern for customers and concern for employees. In ad-
dition, corroborating the work of Borucki and Burke (1999), we examine
the multiple-stakeholder perspective of work climates at the business-unit
level analysis, focusing on the shared climate perceptions among the em-
ployees from the same unit. Although employees attach their individual
meanings when appraising the work environment, a shared perception
may emerge in a unit through the processes of social information pro-
cessing (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978), socialization (Ostroff & Kozlowski,
1992), and attraction–selection–attrition (ASA, Schneider, 1975). Social
information processing theory (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) argues that in-
dividuals use information gathered from their direct social contexts to
interpret organizational practices, values, and norms. Given that members
of the same unit are exposed to similar HR practices, they may possess
shared information and form common perceptions regarding how much the
unit cares about the customers and employees. Likewise, organizational
socialization literature suggests that through interactions, employees may
engage in collective sensemaking and develop relatively stable mental
models, which may serve as the foundation to develop shared climate
perceptions (Kozlowski & Bell, 2003). Further, rooted in the similarity-
attraction paradigm (Byrne, 1971), the ASA perspective (Schneider, 1975)
proposes that individuals of similar characteristics such as backgrounds,
values, personalities, and interests are attracted by, selected to, and re-
tained in the same work unit. Consequently, over time, homogeneity will
increase in a unit, with individuals embracing similar climate perceptions.


158

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Prior studies have provided empirical support for the formation of shared
perceptions among employees of the same unit for speciﬁc climates such
as service climate (e.g., Borucki & Burke, 1999; Schneider, 1990), innova-
tion climate (e.g., Anderson & West, 1998), safety climate (e.g., Hofmann
& Stetzer, 1996), and justice climate (e.g., Liao & Rupp, 2005). There-
fore, we argue that business unit is an appropriate level to examine how
members of the unit appraise the extent to which the unit shows concerns
for its employees and customers.

Researchers have argued that HR practices play a key role in shaping
employee climate perceptions about their work environment (Gelade &
Ivery, 2003; Rogg, Schmidt, Shull, & Schmitt, 2001; Zacharatos et al.,
2005). For example, Rousseau (1995) argues that HR practices serve a
symbolic, or signaling, function by sending messages that help employees
make sense of the psychological meaning of their work situation. Bowen
and Ostroff (2004) also view HR practices as communication from the
management to the employees that directly shapes how the employees
interpret the strategic focus of the organization. Drawing on these theoret-
ical arguments, as shown in Figure 1, in this study we examine concern for
customers and concern for employees as the dual foci of the business unit
and examine the relationship between HPWS and employee perceptions
of the climates for customers and employees.

HPWS and the Climate of Concern for Customers

The climate of concern for customers refers to employees’ shared
perception of the policies, practices, and procedures regarding service
quality provided to the customers in the focal unit (Borucki & Burke,
1999; Schneider, White, & Paul, 1998). The HR practices implemented
in a business unit may signal to its employees the extent to which the
unit values, expects, and rewards providing good service, thus inﬂuencing
employees’ climate perceptions about the unit’s concern for customers’
interests. Using a large retail sample, Borucki and Burke (1999) found
that the importance management placed on service was positively related
to employee shared perceptions of service climate. Several other studies
have also recognized management support as a key factor to service qual-
ity (e.g., Johnson, 1996; Schmit & Allscheid, 1995). Although they did not
examine HR practices directly, these studies provided evidence for the im-
portant role management may play in shaping employees’ psychological
evaluation about the unit’s emphasis on customer service.

Schneider et al. (1998) was among the ﬁrst to directly test the
causal linkages between HR practices and employee shared perceptions
about the climate for service or concern for customers. They proposed
that employees’ perceptions of how much the organization cares about


CHUANG AND LIAO

159

customers or service quality rest on their perceptions about a set of orga-
nizational “foundation issues” such as HR practices of involving employee
in decision making and providing training that supports and facilitates em-
ployee service delivery. Their empirical analysis using data from a sample
of bank branches revealed that these foundation issues indeed shaped
branch-level climate for serving customers. Likewise, Salanova, Agut,
and Peir´o (2005) found from a sample of hotel and restaurant units that
offering employees resources of training and autonomy made employees
feel more engaged in serving customers, which in turn led to more positive
employee shared perceptions of service climate in the unit.

Extending the work by Schneider et al. (1998) and Salanova et al.
(2005), in this study we examine a more comprehensive set of HR practices
of a HPWS based on the strategic human resource management (HRM)
research. We argue that employees are more likely to perceive that the
unit values, expects, and rewards the quality of service provided to the
customers when the unit implements HPWS practices. Such practices may
include selecting and training competent employees to make sure that they
have the competencies to deliver high-quality service, motivating them to
contribute exceptional effort in serving customers by linking performance
appraisal and rewards to service quality and by implementing practices that
promote employees’ work–life balance and physical and psychological
well-being, and involving employees in decision making and allowing
them to exercise individual discretion to respond promptly to customers’
diverse needs. Therefore, we propose:

Hypothesis 1a: HPWS is positively related to employees’ shared cli-
mate perception about the unit’s concern for cus-
tomers.

HPWS and the Climate of Concern for Employees

The climate of concern for employees refers to the shared perceptions
among employees about the extent to which they feel the unit values
their contributions and cares about their well-being (Borucki & Burke,
1999; Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, & Sowa, 1986; Rhoades &
Eisenberger, 2002). HR practices inherently inﬂuence employees’ per-
ceptions of a unit’s level of support (Whitener, 2001) because employees
obtain favorable tangible and socio-emotional resources or receive un-
favorable treatment from the unit through HR practices. HPWS, which
consists of HR practices such as stafﬁng via internal promotion, develop-
ing employee competencies via extensive training, involving employees in
decision making, providing employees with fair performance appraisals,
rewarding employees for superior performance, and providing ﬂexible


160

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

work schedules and locations, as well as other practices to improve em-
ployee work–life balance and health, signals to the employees the unit’s
investment in employees’ development, recognition of their contribution,
and care in their well-being. These HR practices send a message to the
employees that concern for employees is a strategic focus of the unit
(Schneider & Bowen, 1992), and an accumulation over time of favorable
treatments makes employees perceive that they are receiving a high level of
support from the unit. Although the psychological perception of organiza-
tional support is originally constructed at the individual level (Eisenberger
et al., 1986), a unit-level psychological climate will emerge when employ-
ees in the focal unit show perceptual agreement about whether the unit
cares for them (James et al., 2008; Vandenberghe, et al., 2007). A recent
study by Takeuchi, Chen, and Lepak (2009) was among the ﬁrst to exam-
ine employee shared perception of organizational support at the business
establishment/unit level. Consistent with the terminology of Borucki and
Burke (1999) and the one used in this study, Takeuchi et al. labeled this
aggregated construct as a climate of concern for employees. Using a sam-
ple of 76 Japanese establishments, they provided empirical evidence for
sufﬁcient agreement among employees of the same establishment about
their perceptions of the establishment’s concern for employers and found
that HPWS practices implemented in the establishment were positively
associated with the employees’ shared perceptions regarding the estab-
lishment’s concern for employees. Building upon and extending the work
of Takeuchi et al., we examine the role of HPWS in shaping a climate
of concern for employees in addition to shaping a climate of concern for
customers. We propose that:

Hypothesis 1b: HPWS is positively related to employees’ shared cli-
mate perception about the unit’s concern for employ-
ees.

Unit Climates and Employee Performance

We next argue that unit climate is a proximal antecedent of employee
performance, which is crucial for the unit’s market performance. Borman
and Motowidlo (1993) and Organ (1997) argued for extending the em-
ployee performance criterion domain beyond core job responsibilities to
include both in-role task performance and extra-role contextual perfor-
mance or organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Both performance
domains contribute uniquely to overall performance (Conway, 1999). In
service settings, service performance, or helping customers and address-
ing customer needs (Liao & Chuang, 2004), is the primary responsibility
of front-line employees and thus represents in-role task performance.


CHUANG AND LIAO

161

Meanwhile, OCB involves discretionary behavior that generally serves
to lubricate the social machinery of the organization (Bateman &
Organ, 1983; Smith, Organ, & Near, 1983), reduce friction, and increase
efﬁciency (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993; Smith et al., 1983). Although
OCB has been constructed at the individual level in most research (e.g.,
D’Amato & Zijlstra, 2008; Netemeyer, Boles, McKee, & McMurrian,
1997), researchers call for more attention to examine how unit-level OCB
contributes to unit performance (Ehrhart, 2004; Koys, 2001; Podsakoff,
Ahearne, MacKenzie, 1997).

No clear consensus is made in the literature on how many dimen-
sions of citizenship behavior exist (LePine, Erez, & Johnson, 2002; Pod-
sakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000), but the behavior of helping
coworkers has been one of the most studied dimensions with the most
consistent ﬁndings. Moreover, helping behavior has been identiﬁed as an
important consideration when observing how citizenship behavior is ex-
pressed in Chinese culture (Farh, Earley, & Lin, 1997; Farh, Zhong, &
Organ, 2004), where this study was conducted. Therefore, we focus on
the helping dimension of OCB in this study. Extending the few prior stud-
ies that have linked organizational climates to either service performance
(Borucki & Burke, 1999) or OCB (e.g., Schneider, Ehrhart, Mayer, Saltz,
& Niles-Jolly, 2005) at the business-unit level of analysis, we examine
the impact of a climate of concern for customers and a climate of con-
cern for employees on both employee collective service performance and
employee collective helping behavior as presented in Figure 1.

Climate of Concern for Customers and Employee Performance

Employees’ behaviors at work (task and contextual performance) can
be regarded as a reaction to their interpretations and appraisals of work
environment (cf. D’Amato & Zijlstra, 2008). A positive unit climate of
concern for customers makes employees perceive that superior service
is expected, desired, and rewarded, thus providing a strong motivational
force for employees to provide high-quality service in their service deliv-
ery. Indeed, prior research has found that a unit-level climate for service
is positively associated with both unit-level (Borucki & Burke, 1999) and
individual-level (Liao & Chuang, 2004) employee service performance.
At the same time, concern for customers also elicits helping behavior
between coworkers because the positive climate signals to employees that
good customer service requires behaviors that go beyond typical in-role
expectations (Schneider et al., 2005), as long as these behaviors sup-
port customer services. Coworker support and cooperation are essential
in the delivery of excellent service by the whole group (Deeter-Schmelz
& Ramsey, 2003; Netemeyer et al., 1997). For example, customers often


162

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

randomly ask a waiter or waitress who just passes by for a napkin or a
glass of water without waiting for their in-charge waiter/waitress. With a
more positive climate of concern for customers, a waiter/waitress is more
likely to recognize the need and feel encouraged and willing to go above
and beyond the call of duty, and thus is more likely to promptly attend
to these customers’ needs, which can highly contribute to the customers’
overall service experience. Therefore, we propose:

Hypothesis 2a: Employees’ shared climate perception of the unit’s
concern for customers is positively related to collec-
tive employee service performance.

Hypothesis 2b: Employees’ shared climate perception of the unit’s
concern for customers is positively related to collec-
tive employee helping behavior.

Climate of Concern for Employees and Employee Performance

A climate of concern for employees also motivates employees to serve
customers well and to help each other. Employees who receive induce-
ments from the unit tend to have positive perceptions about the unit
(Payne & Webber, 2006). In line with the norm of reciprocity (Gould-
ner, 1960), employees then feel obligated to respond positively and to
repay their unit by performing well and even above expectations. It has
been suggested that employees who are treated as valuable resources by
their employing organization tend to treat customers as valuable (Heskett,
Sasser, Jones, Loveman, & Schlesinger, 1994; Schneider & Bowen, 1985).
Indeed, Vandenberghe et al. (2007) found that unit-level support percep-
tions of the customer-contact employees could encourage individual em-
ployees to help customers. Further, Borucki and Burke (1999) showed
that employee shared perception of a retail store’s concern for employees
was positively associated with employees’ collective service performance.
Likewise, using a unit-level analysis, Schmit and Allscheid (1995) found
that employees’ shared appraisals of their work situations were positively
related to their intentions to provide quality services. Consistent with the
above assertion and empirical evidence, we propose that a shared per-
ception about the unit’s concern for employees would facilitate collective
service performance of the unit’s front-line employees.

In addition, empirical evidence also shows that employees are in-
clined to engage in extra-role, contextual performance if they perceive
a high level of support from the organization (Rhoades & Eisenberger,
2002). For example, Piercy, Cravens, Lane, and Vorhies (2006) showed
that salespersons’ individual perceptions of the organization’s concern for
them could predict their OCB. Extending Piercy et al. from the individual


CHUANG AND LIAO

163

level of analysis to the unit level of analysis, we argue that once a shared
perception about the unit’s concern for employees is formed at the unit
level, a shared reciprocal obligation will emerge at the unit level, which
will induce not only in-role collective service performance but also collec-
tive employee behaviors to contribute beyond the call of duty and engage
in helping behavior toward coworkers. Therefore, we propose:

Hypothesis 3a: Employees’ shared climate perception of the unit’s
concern for employees is positively related to collec-
tive employee service performance.

Hypothesis 3b: Employees’ shared climate perception of the unit’s
concern for employees is positively related to collec-
tive employee helping behavior.

Employee Performance and Unit Performance

For service units, front-line employees who are placed at the unit-
customer interface and are directly responsible for service delivery play a
pivotal role in enhancing unit performance. The performance behaviors of
these employees are the services provided and constitute the central part
of customer experience (Liao & Chuang, 2004). Their behaviors directly
inﬂuence customer perceptions of service quality, the level of customer
loyalty, and the amount of sales. Empirical evidence of the service proﬁt
chain (Heskett et al., 1994) research has shown that reliable, responsive,
courteous, friendly, and helpful service performance promotes customer
satisfaction and loyalty (e.g., Borucki & Burke, 1999; Liao, 2007; Liao &
Chuang, 2004; Salanova et al., 2005; Schneider, Ashworth, Higgs, & Carr,
1996), which in turn improves a unit’s market performance in terms of mar-
ket share, sales growth, and proﬁtability (Heskett et al., 1994; Reichheld &
Sasser, 1990). Moreover, empirical studies also support a positive relation-
ship between unit-level citizenship behavior and unit performance (Koys,
2001; Podsakoff et al., 1997; Podsakoff & MacKenzie, 1994; Schnei-
der et al., 2005). Speciﬁcally, helping behavior among coworkers may
contribute to a unit’s success by improving coordination between group
members and across work groups, enhancing coworker productivity, and
improving the unit’s ability to adapt to environmental changes (Podsakoff
et al., 2000).

Based on these arguments and ﬁndings, in Figure 1 we hypothesize
that front-line employees’ collective service performance to customers
and collective helping behaviors to coworkers are key factors inﬂuencing
a business unit’s market performance of sales growth, market share, and
proﬁtability. We focus on collective performance rather than individual
performance in this study because of the joint impacts that employee


164

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

behaviors may have on the unit. Unit market performance is likely to be
a reﬂection of the interactions of employee behaviors, and the cumulative
interactions may create a stronger relationship with the unit’s performance
than the simple sum of individual performance (Ostroff & Bowen, 2000).
For example, customers shopping in retail stores often interact with multi-
ple front-line employees in a somewhat random fashion (i.e., their service
encounters may involve any front-line employees who are in the store
at the time of visit). Sales transactions are more likely to be completed
smoothly and customer satisfaction is thus more likely to be higher in
stores whose sales associates are cooperative toward the customers and
each other across the board. Accordingly, the overall level of employee
performance may contribute to the business unit’s market performance
(Liao & Chuang, 2004). Therefore, we propose:

Hypothesis 4a: Collective employee service performance contributes

to the business unit’s market performance.

Hypothesis 4b: Collective employee helping behavior contributes to

the business unit’s market performance.

The Mediating Mechanisms of the HPWS-Unit Performance Link

So far we have argued that the HR practices of a HPWS can facilitate
dual climates of concern for customers and concern for employees, which
in turn may encourage employees to engage in service performance and
helping behavior that are essential for achieving superior market perfor-
mance. Our hypothesized model is rooted from the insight that HPWS
inﬂuences unit performance indirectly through unit climate and employee
performance (Ferris et al., 1998; Kopelman et al., 1990; Ostroff & Bowen,
2000). Past studies provide preliminary evidence of unit climate playing as
a critical link between HR systems and unit performance (e.g., Gelade &
Ivery, 2003). We further differentiate two key climates in service settings
based on the work of Burke et al. (1992) and Borucki and Burke (1999).
In addition, past research provides evidence to construct service perfor-
mance as a mediator of the unit climate–unit performance relationship,
and we extend this literature by uniquely adding contextual performance
to the investigation and extend the previous investigation of this mediated
relationship from individual level of analysis (e.g., D’Amato & Zijlstra,
2008) to unit level of analysis. Taken together, we propose that the re-
lationship between HPWS and the unit’s performance is mediated by
unit climates and collective employee performance. Our model shown
as Figure 1 represents the type of long mediation chain as discussed in
Taylor, MacKinnon, and Tein (2008) in which two layers of mediators


CHUANG AND LIAO

165

intervene in a series between an independent variable (i.e., HPWS) and a
dependent variable (i.e., unit’s performance).

This research does not, however, assert that all the effects of HPWS
on unit performance are mediated by unit climate and employee behav-
iors. The HR system of a unit is likely to inﬂuence the unit’s perfor-
mance through other potential mediators (Kopelman et al., 1990; Ostroff
& Bowen, 2000). For example, customer-contact employees are in great
need of sales competency customer service competency, and product (or
service) knowledge for successfully serving customers. Stafﬁng helps ob-
tain competent employees and ﬁt them to the jobs, and training maintains
and improves service competencies and keeps employees oriented toward
the customers. In addition, customer-contact employees often need to ad-
dress nonstandard and unpredictable customer needs, and then require
immediate attention and creative personal judgment. Providing opportu-
nities to use individual discretion may free them up to be more responsive
to customer requests and take necessary actions to satisfy their customers
(Batt, 2002). As our research model captures the motivation mediator of
the HR-performance link, other ability and opportunity factors may also
serve as mediators (Batt, 2002; Boxall & Purcell, 2002; Lepak et al.,
2006). Therefore, we propose:

Hypothesis 5: Unit climates (i.e., climate of concern for employees
and climate of concern for customers) and collective
employee performance (i.e., collective service perfor-
mance and collective helping behavior) partially me-
diate the relationship between HPWS and the business
unit’s market performance.

Method

Participants and Procedures

The theoretical framework of this study was tested by collecting data
over two time periods from the managers and employees of multiple
service stores in Taiwan, including retail stores, hair and beauty salons,
and restaurants and caf´es. Because different sets of HR practices may be
implemented to manage different groups of employees within the same
organization (Lepak & Snell, 1999), we focused entirely on customer-
contact employees. Only stores with at least ﬁve employees were invited
to participate because HR practices are more likely to be present at larger
stores (Wright & Boswell, 2002). In addition, we would include no more
than three chain stores from a single company to increase the heterogeneity
of HR practices in the sample.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

To reduce common-method variance and make temporal inference
of the studied variables, we obtained survey information from various
sources at two different phases. In the ﬁrst phase, a store manager was
invited to rate items of HR practices for managing customer-contact em-
ployees. Sales associates of retail stores, stylists and assistants of hair
and beauty salons, and waitstaff of restaurants and caf´es were asked to
assess two climate variables in their work environment and their customer
knowledge. Employees who were not in regular contact with customers
were excluded. Due to the complexity of data collection procedures and to
increase participation rate, the ﬁrst author and/or trained assistants visited
stores personally to deliver packages of surveys and to explain the collec-
tion procedures. Surveys were collected later by research assistants. Each
package given to a store contained one copy of the manager survey and 10
copies of the employee survey, and each survey was accompanied by an
envelope. The store manager of each store was asked to designate an em-
ployee to collect sealed envelopes from employees to ensure anonymity.
A total of 885 stores were solicited to participate, and 207 stores returned
surveys, representing a response rate of 23%. After excluding stores that
returned surveys from part-time employees only and those who returned
fewer than ﬁve employee surveys, we had 194 manager surveys (1 survey
per store) and 1,193 employee surveys from 194 stores.

Approximately 1 year later, two store managers from the same 194
stores were asked to rate the overall service performance and helping
behavior of front-line employees and to report market performance of
their stores. Twenty-one stores were either closed or moved, and they
could not be found by searching through the yellow pages or the Internet.
A total of 133 stores returned at least one survey, representing a response
rate of about 69%. The ﬁnal sample with complete information for all the
study variables included 133 stores. Comparing the sample of 133 stores
with the sample of the 61 stores that dropped out at the second phase,
we found no statistically signiﬁcant mean differences in store size, store
age, concern for customers, and concern for employees between the two
samples, but the former sample had a higher rating of HPWS than the latter
(mean difference = .15, p < .05). Therefore, we might have a restriction
of range on the HPWS measure, which could cause the estimated effects
of HPWS to be weaker than what might be in a more diverse sample.

Among the 133 stores, 114 stores returned two manager surveys, al-
lowing us to split the sample so that the data of employee performance and
market performance were from different managers. For the remaining 19
stores, which returned only one manager survey, employee performance
and market performance measures were from the same manager. To alle-
viate concern of common-source bias, we conducted analyses using both
the full sample of 133 stores and the sample of 114 stores and found that


CHUANG AND LIAO

167

both sets yielded highly similar results. Therefore, we retained the full
sample to increase statistical power and estimation efﬁciency.

The ﬁnal sample consisted of 71 retail stores, 24 hair and beauty salons,
and 38 restaurants and caf´es. Although the majority of them (90 stores)
were chain afﬁliated, stores in our sample belonged to 76 different chains;
1 chain had three stores, 12 chains each had two stores, and the remaining
63 chains each had one store. The average number of employees per store
was 13.34. There were a total of 828 employee respondents, with 71%
female employees, 83% full-time employees, and 57% of employees have
earned a high-school diploma.

The mean within-store response rate was about 66%, with 92 (or 69%)
of the 133 stores having at least a 50% response rate. To alleviate concern
of potential response bias, we compared the analytic results of the entire
sample with the results for a sample from which we deleted the stores
with the response rates lower than 50% (Schneider et al., 2005). Again
we found no signiﬁcant difference in the results using these two different
samples. We thus retained the full sample of 133 stores in our formal
analysis.

Scale Development and Measure Translation

Procedures were taken to ensure measurement validity. We devel-
oped the scale of HPWS by reviewing the literature and interviewing
with several store managers and front-line employees. In addition, seven
HR scholars and professionals were invited to validate the content of HR
practices. The other scales were published measures. They were translated
into Chinese by three HR researchers, and the back-translation procedures
recommended by Brislin (1980) were followed. We then discussed the em-
ployee survey with several customer-contact employees to further improve
the readability of the survey.

Measures

High-performance work systems. A total of 35 items (rated from
1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) were used to measure
HPWS, including six subscales (practices) of stafﬁng, training, involve-
ment/participation, performance appraisals, compensation/rewards, and
caring. The full list of items is presented in the Appendix. Among them,
nine items were adapted from the commitment-based HR conﬁguration
of Lepak and Snell (2002), and two items examining employee discre-
tion were taken from Batt (2002). All subscales displayed good internal
reliability, except for the subscale of involvement/participation for which
α was .61. Following the subscale aggregation approach, as supported


168

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

by Drasgow and Kanfer (1985) and used in prior strategic HRM stud-
ies such as Zacharatos et al. (2005), we calculated the mean scores of
each subscale (practice) and used them as indicators of the latent variable
HPWS in the conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). The overall α was .92
across the subscales.

Unit’s climate of concern for customers. Employees’ perceptions
about the store’s concern for customers were rated with the seven-item
global service climate scale developed by Schneider et al. (1998). A
sample item was “the leadership shown by management in our store in
supporting the service quality effort.” Employees responded to these items
on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = very poor to 7 = excellent.
Unit’s climate of concern for employees. The eight-item short form
of the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support (Eisenberger et al.,
1986) was employed to measure concern for employees at each store.
These items (rated from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) were
reworded to focus on how customer-contact employees were treated as
a whole. Sample items include “our store really cares about employees’
well-being.”

Concern for customers and concern for employees are theoretically
distinguishable constructs (Borucki & Burke, 1999; Burke et al., 1992;
Schneider & Bowen, 1992), and we conducted factor analyses to provide
further evidence for their distinctiveness by using employee-level data
(n = 822 after deleting cases with missing values). We randomly split
the 822 cases into two subgroups with 411 respondents each to conduct
exploratory factor analysis and CFA, respectively. The items of concern
for customers and concern for employees rated by the ﬁrst group were
submitted to a principal components analysis with varimax rotation. Two
factors emerged with eigenvalues greater than 1 and appropriately repre-
sented the items of concern for customers and concern for employees, with
primary loadings exceeding .65. The two factors accounted for 64.43%
of the variance. We then used responses from the other group to run CFA
to verify the factor structure of the climate items. Results showed that
the two-factor model provided a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt than the one-factor
model (χ 2 = 676.15, df = 1, p < .01). Moreover, the two sets of
ﬁt indexes showed that the two-factor model (root mean square error of
approximation [RMSEA] = .08, non-normed ﬁt index [NNFI] = .94,
index
comparative ﬁt
[PNFI] = .78) ﬁtted the data better than the one-factor model (RMSEA
= .16, NNFI = .78, CFI = .81, PNFI = .68). In the two-factor model, all
items signiﬁcantly loaded on their respective latent constructs (p < .01).
From these results, we concluded that these items were reasonable mea-
sures of concern for customers and concern for employees, respectively,
and the two climate constructs were distinct.

Service performance. Service performance was assessed with seven
items adapted from Liao and Chuang (2004), which was originally devel-
oped by Borucki and Burke (1999). Items were reworded for managers
to rate the service performance of their stores as a whole (1 = strongly
disagree to 7 = strongly agree). An example item is that “our employees
ask good questions and listen to ﬁnd out what a customer wants.”
Helping behavior. Helping behavior was assessed with a seven-item
helping subscale of citizenship behavior developed by Podsakoff et al.
(1997). This scale has been applied to work groups and ﬁts this study.
Items were reworded for managers to rate the store employees’ overall
helping behavior (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree). A sample
question is “our employees willingly give of their time to help coworkers
who have work-related problems.”

Market performance. Managers were asked to rate their store market
performance relative to that of other competitors for the past 12 months
on a response format ranging from 1 = much worse to 5 = much better,
by using Delaney and Huselid’s (1996) four-item scale (marketing, sales
growth, proﬁtability, and market share). The comparative method has
been suggested to be more effective at eliciting responses than directly
asking respondents to provide exact ﬁgures (Tomaskovis-Devey, Leiter, &
Thompson, 1994). We used manager-reported measures to assess unit mar-
ket performance because obtaining objective performance data of stores
from over 100 different organizations was not feasible. Although there has
been concern with the validity of subjective performance measures, Wall
and colleagues recently demonstrated the convergent, discriminant, and
construct validities of subjective performance measures judged against ob-
jective performance measures in research ﬁndings relating management
practices and performance (Wall et al., 2004), suggesting that self-reported
measures are useful in studies where objective ones are not available. They
also estimated an average of .52 correlation between manager’s perceived
and actual ﬁrm performance (Wall et al., 2004). Further, self-reported per-
formance measures have often been employed in published studies on the
HR-performance link (e.g., Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Sun et al., 2007;
Takeuchi et al., 2007; Youndt et al., 1996) and are deemed acceptable to
use in comparing the effectiveness of organizations providing different
types of services and products (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Takeuchi et al.,
2007).

For those 114 stores returning two manager surveys in the second
phase, we calculated average mean deviation (AD) index to determine the
level of agreement among manager ratings of service performance, help-
ing behavior, and market performance (Burke & Dunlap, 2002; Burke,
Finkelstein, & Dusig, 1999). The AD index, which is particularly de-
veloped for situations with small numbers of raters and items, “involves


170

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

determining the extent to which each item rating differs from the mean
(or median) item rating, summing the absolute values of these deviations
(ignoring plus or minus signs), and dividing the sum by the number of
deviations” (Burke & Dunlap, 2002, p. 160). We adopted an upper-limit
cutoff of .83 (c/6, where c indicating the number of response options for a
measure item) as suggested by Burke and Dunlap (2002) when a 5-point
Likert scale is used, with smaller indices indicating stronger agreement
among raters. The AD index for each item of service performance (ranged
between .35 and .47), helping behavior (ranged between .40 and .51), and
market performance (ranged between .36 and .48) all showed that two
managers at the same store reached an acceptable level of agreement.
Further, another index of interrater agreement rwg(J) (James, Demaree,
& Wolf, 1984) was calculated. The mean rwg value was .91 for service
performance, .88 for helping behavior, and .88 for market performance.
These results provided evidence for the interrater agreement of the man-
agers’ ratings, hence increasing the conﬁdence in using just one manager’s
ratings to represent the store’s employee performance and market perfor-
mance. We also computed intraclass correlation or ICC(1) and reliability
of group mean or ICC(2) (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000). ICC(1) values were
all signiﬁcant for the three variables, with the values of .39 for service
performance, .24 for helping behavior, and .37 for market performance.
In addition, ICC(2) values for service performance, helping behavior, and
market performance were .57, .39, and .54 respectively. The relative low
ICC(2) values were comparable to other studies conducted in the service
context with very small number of respondents form each unit (e.g., Liao
et al., 2009). To reduce common-source bias, in our subsequent analy-
ses we did not average two manager scores but rather split the sample
to use one manager’s evaluation of the employee performance and one
manager’s evaluation of the unit’s market performance.

Control variable. Human capital has been recognized as an important
resource that drives employees’ contributions to the organization, and em-
pirical evidence has provided support for the link between human capital
and unit performance (e.g., Takeuchi et al., 2007). In the service context,
the level of employees’ customer knowledge is an important indicator of
the employees’ service human capital. To successfully interact with differ-
ent types of customers and to help each other, customer-contact employees
should have rich knowledge about customer characteristics and various
strategies for meeting the diverse needs of different customers (Betten-
court, Gwinner, & Meuter, 2001; Sujan, Sujan, & Bettman, 1988; Weitz,
Sujan, & Sujan, 1986). Therefore, employees’ customer knowledge may
affect their performance by inﬂuencing their ability to serve customers and
help coworkers. Therefore, we control for the effects of customer knowl-
edge on collective service performance and collective helping behavior to


CHUANG AND LIAO

171

assess how organizational climates can inﬂuence employee behaviors be-
yond the effect of human capital. Store employees responded to ﬁve items
(1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) of the customer knowledge
measure created by Bettencourt et al. (2001).

Data Aggregation

Variables of interest in this study were conceptualized at the store
level, which required an aggregation of two climates and customer knowl-
edge rated by employees. We examined aggregation statistics, including
ICC(1), ICC(2) (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000), and within-group agreement
of multiple item rwg(J) (James et al., 1984). The ICC(1) scores of concern
for customers, concern for employees, and customer knowledge were .36,
.33, and .14 respectively. The ICC(2) values for these variables were .80,
.78, and .55 respectively. The mean rwg values were .86 for concern for
customers, .94 for concern for employees, and .92 for customer knowl-
edge. These values are comparable to other studies on HPWS and unit
climate (e.g., Liao & Chuang, 2004; Takeuchi et al., 2009). Based on
the recommendation of Burke and Dunlap (2002), we also calculated AD
index for these three variables. Given that a 7-point Likert scale was used,
every item of concern for customers displayed a mean AD value below the
threshold value of 1.17 (ranged between .62 and .76), showing acceptable
levels of agreement among employees. Likewise, all values of mean AD
about concern for employees (ranged between .47 and .60) and customer
knowledge (ranged between .44 and .54) were below the threshold value
of .83, given that a 5-point Likert scale was used for both constructs.
These results provided sufﬁcient support for aggregating the data to the
store level of analyses.

Analyses

We ﬁrst used CFA to test whether each of the measurement items spec-
iﬁed could load signiﬁcantly onto the latent constructs with which they
were associated and whether each construct was empirically distinct from
the others. Then, as recommended by researchers (e.g., James, Mulaik,
& Brett, 2006; MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002),
we employed structural equation modeling, which provides a better bal-
ance of Type I error rates and statistical power by simultaneously testing
both paths from an independent variable to a mediator and from the me-
diator to the dependent variable (MacKinnon et al., 2002) to examine the
relationships proposed in the research model. Maximum likelihood esti-
mation, which is an appropriate method for a sample size ranging from
100 to 200 (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998), was used as the


172

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

estimation procedure. To increase the ratio of sample size to free param-
eter, we combined the scale items to create three “composite” indicators
for concern for customers, concern for employees, service performance,
and helping behavior, respectively, following the procedure by Mathieu
and Farh (1991). The items included in each composite were listed in the
Appendix.

In terms of testing the meditational hypotheses, MacKinnon et al.
(2002) compared 14 methods to test mediation via simulations and con-
cluded that the joint signiﬁcance test provided the best balance of small
Type 1 error and high statistical power. The test requires that the path
from the independent variable to the mediator is statistically signiﬁcant
and the path from the mediator to the dependent variable, adjusted for
the independent variable, is also signiﬁcant. Nevertheless, as these au-
thors pointed out, a limitation of the joint signiﬁcance test is that it does
not provide an estimate of the magnitude of the mediated/indirect effect;
therefore, researchers may prefer using a product of coefﬁcient test that
is close to the joint signiﬁcance test in accuracy and at the same time
generates an estimate of the magnitude and statistical signiﬁcance for the
mediated/indirect effect. MacKinnon et al. (2002) further noted that a
major difﬁculty in using product-of-coefﬁcients tests is that distribution
of the product of two regression coefﬁcients is not normal as the tests
often assume, leading to poor performance of the tests. As a result, sev-
eral researchers have suggested that resampling procedure, which does
not make distribution assumptions, be used to deal with the possibility of
nonnormal distribution of the mediated effects (MacKinnon, Lockwood,
& Williams, 2004; Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Bootstrap analysis is one such
widely used resampling method and involves drawing a large number of
bootstrap samples with replacement from the original data set and then
estimating parameters in each bootstrap sample as in the original data. The
distribution of the estimates from bootstrap samples can form conﬁdence
intervals to determine statistical signiﬁcance of the mediated effects; if
the (1 – α)100% conﬁdence intervals do not contain the value of zero,
then the mediated effects was signiﬁcant at α level (Taylor et al., 2008;
Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Taylor et al. suggested that bootstrap analysis can
be employed not only in the single-mediator situation but also in longer
mediational chains in which the relationship between the predictor and
the outcome is mediated by more than one layer of mediators, as the case
in this study. Therefore, we adopted the bootstrap procedure to test the
mediation Hypothesis 5. In particular, we used AMOS 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
2008) to perform a bootstrap on 1,000 samples, obtaining bias-corrected
conﬁdence intervals for each parameter in the model. The bias-corrected
bootstrap has been recommended and employed in this study because
this method tends to improve power in testing the mediated effects,


CHUANG AND LIAO

173

albeit it risks a little excess Type I error rate (MacKinnon et al., 2004). To
balance the slight increase in Type I error rate, we supplement the bias-
corrected bootstrap by performing a joint signiﬁcance test, which is more
conservative, to see whether each of the path coefﬁcient in the mediation
chain is statistically nonzero.

Results

Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, correlations, and coef-
ﬁcient α of all the studied constructs. As shown in Table 1, all hypothesized
pairs of relationships were statistically signiﬁcant.

Measurement Model Analyses

The results of CFA indicated that the hypothesized seven-factor model
ﬁt the data well (χ 2 = 306.17, df = 231, p < .01, RMSEA = .05,
NNFI = .96, CFI = .97, PNFI = .75). For evidence of discriminant
validity, we compared the hypothesized measurement model with a ﬁve-
factor model in which concern for customers and concern for employees
were combined as unit climate, and service performance and helping
behavior were combined as employee performance. Chi-square difference
tests indicated that the hypothesized seven-factor model provided a better
ﬁt for the data than the ﬁve-factor model (△χ 2 = 374.87, △df = 11, p <
.001), suggesting that constructs used in this study were distinct.
An examination of the correlation matrix of the latent variables sug-
gests a relatively high level of correlation between unit-level concern for
customers and concern for employees (r = .76, p < .01). We separated
these two climate variables in our analyses primarily based on their dis-
tinct theoretical conceptualization and that previous research has treated
them as two different factors (Borucki & Burke, 1999; Burke et al., 1992).
We further tested their discriminant validity in our data following the
suggestions of Fornell and Larcker (1981) and Netemeyer, Johnston, and
Burton (1990). The variances extracted by concern for customers and con-
cern for employees were compared with the squared correlation between
these two latent constructs. The variance extracted estimates of concern
for customers and concern for employees were .94 and .88, respectively,
and both exceeded the square of the correlation between these two con-
structs (2 = .58), showing evidence of discriminant validity. Further,
the phi coefﬁcient was signiﬁcantly less than 1 (standard error = .04).
After using standard error to create a conﬁdence interval, the conﬁdence
interval was shown to not include a value of 1 (J¨oreskog & S¨orbom,
1993). These statistics, together with the CFA results, offer support for
the distinctiveness of concern for customers and concern for employees.

Next, the measurement of each construct was assessed by examining
the estimated factor loadings for statistical signiﬁcance and by examining
the composite reliability and the variance extracted from that construct.
The relationship between each indicator variable and its respective latent
variable was statistically signiﬁcant (p < .01). The composite reliability,
which depicts the degree to which they “indicate” the common latent
construct (Hair et al., 1998: 612), ranged from .68 to .98. The variance
extracted measure, which represents the overall amount of variance in the
indicators that are accounted for by the latent construct (Hair et al., 1998:
612), ranged from .46 to .94.

Structural Model Analyses

The ﬁt of the structural model was assessed by adding the predicted
paths to the measurement model. Because we hypothesized a partial medi-
ation model, a direct path from HPWS to market performance was added,
indicating that part of the causal effect of HPWS on the unit’s market per-
formance was direct, whereas a separate part of the causal effect passed
through unit climates and employee collective performance (James et al.,
2006). The hypothesized research model (Figure 1) achieved an accept-
able ﬁt with this data (χ 2 = 365.50, df = 239, RMSEA = .06, NNFI = .94,
CFI = .95; PNFI = .75). In reviewing the structural parameter estimates,
we found that the coefﬁcients of the path from HPWS to market perfor-
mance (γ 51 = .07, p = .48), of the path from concern for customers to
helping behavior (β 41 = .21, p= .12), and of the path from concern for em-
ployees to service performance (β 32 = –.01, p = .94) were nonsigniﬁcant.
In addition, no signiﬁcant path existed between customer knowledge and
helping behavior. We retained the direct link between HPWS and market
performance for further analyses but deleted the other three nonsigniﬁcant
structural paths from the hypothesized model for parsimony. The revised
model was reﬁt to the data, resulting in a better parsimony index (χ 2 =
370.81, df = 242, RMSEA = .06, NNFI = .94, CFI = .95; PNFI = .76),
and the increase in χ 2 was not statistically signiﬁcant (χ 2 = 5.31, df
= 3, ns).
As depicted in Figure 2, we found a strong, positive relationship be-
tween the measure of HPWS and concern for customers (γ 11 = .43, p <
.001) as well as a strong, positive relationship between the measure of
HPWS and concern for employees (γ 21 = .51, p < .001), thus supporting
Hypotheses 1a and 1b. The coefﬁcient of the path from concern for cus-
tomers to service performance was signiﬁcant (β 31 = .38, p < .001), but
not the relationship between concern for customers and helping behavior.
Hypothesis 2a was supported but not Hypothesis 2b. On the other hand,
no signiﬁcant path existed between concern for employees and service

performance, failing to support Hypothesis 3a. Meanwhile, the coefﬁ-
cient of the path from concern for employees to helping behavior was
signiﬁcant (β 42 = .49, p < .001), supporting Hypothesis 3b. Moreover,
we found statistically signiﬁcant and positive coefﬁcients for the paths
between service performance and market performance (β 53 = .21, p <
.05) and between helping behavior and market performance (β 54 = .29,
p < .01). The results supported both Hypothesis 4a and Hypothesis 4b.

Mediation Analysis

The above analyses showed that the mediators were signiﬁcantly re-
lated to both HPWS and the unit’s market performance. To examine
whether unit climates and collective employee performance mediated
the relationship between HPWS and market performance, we performed
a bias-corrected bootstrap analysis to calculate the conﬁdence intervals
for the direct effects and the mediated effects, as recommended by Mac-
Kinnon and colleagues (MacKinnon et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2008). For
the revised model (Figure 2), 1,000 bootstrap samples were generated and
bias-corrected conﬁdence intervals for each of the bootstrap estimates
were formed.

In examining such a long chain mediation model, a joint signiﬁcance
test reveals that each of these paths in the revised model (HPWS → con-
cern for customers, concern for customers→ service performance, service
performance → market performance; HPWS → concern for employees,
concern for employees → helping behavior, helping behavior → mar-
ket performance) was signiﬁcantly nonzero,1 thus providing evidence for
mediation (MacKinnon et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2008). Moreover, boot-
strap analysis provides estimates of the mediated effect and conﬁdence
intervals. The indirect effect of HPWS on collective service performance
(γ 11× β 31) was .164, whereas the mediated or indirect effect of HPWS
on collective helping behavior (γ 21× β 42) was .247. Neither 95% conﬁ-
dence interval includes zero.2 In addition, the mediated effect of HPWS
on the unit’s market performance (γ 11× β 31× β 53 + γ 21 × β 42 × β 54)
was .106, with a 95% conﬁdence interval ranging from .052 to .202.

1The 95% conﬁdence intervals of these paths were HPWS → concern for customers
(.281, 583), concern for customers → service performance (.156, .574), service perfor-
mance → market performance (.007, .440); HPWS → concern for employees (.356, .625),
concern for employees → helping behavior (.310, .643), helping behavior → market per-
formance (.028, .560).
2The 95% conﬁdence intervals of the indirect effect of HPWS → concern for cus-
tomers → service performance and the indirect effect of HPWS → concern for employ-
ees → helping behavior were (.064, .295) and (.142, .381) respectively.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

We conclude that mediation was present because the mediated or indirect
effect of HPWS on market performance was signiﬁcantly different from
zero (Shrout & Bolger, 2002; Taylor et al., 2008).

Next we computed the magnitude of the indirect effect by using Alwin
and Hauser’s (1975) formula. The total effect of HPWS on unit mar-
ket performance is equal to the estimate taken from the reduced form
equation that includes HPWS as the only independent variable (Alwin
& Hauser, 1975). Therefore, we ﬁt a structure model in which HPWS
was the exogenous construct and market performance was the endoge-
nous construct and found that the standardized regression coefﬁcient of
the HPWS-market performance relationship was .233 (p < .05). The
percentage of the total effect that was mediated through unit climate
and collective employee performance was about 45% (.106/.233). The
results suggest that 1 standard deviation increase in HPWS was asso-
ciated with .23 standard deviation increase in the market performance,
and the intervening variables transmitted 45% of the effect. There-
fore, the partial mediation hypothesis proposed in Hypothesis 5 was
supported.3

The squared multiple correlations or R2 for structural equations was .19
for the climate of concern for customers, .26 for the climate of concern for
employees, .24 for both service performance and helping behavior, and .17
for market performance, suggesting that a moderate amount of variance
in these variables was accounted for by our model speciﬁcations.

Discussion

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the intermediate link-
ages between HR practices and organizational performance in the service
context. Although previous studies have provided preliminary empirical
evidence, we extend the literature by integrating different types of organi-
zational climate and various domains of employee behavior in our research
framework. In particular, we propose that HR practices of a HPWS can
facilitate a climate of concern for customers and a climate of concern for
employees, which motivate employees to engage in cooperative behaviors
toward customers and coworkers, and then contribute to a business unit’s
market performance.

3Although the direct path from HPWS to market performance was nonsigniﬁcant (β 51 =
.074) in the revised structural model, unit climate and collective employee performance did
not account for 100% of the total effect, thus indicating partial mediation. Moreover, form
a conceptual point of view, concern for customers, and concern for employees unlikely
mediate all the effect of HPWS on market performance as discussed previously. Accord-
ingly, our empirical results supported partial mediation. We thank one of the anonymous
reviewers for the insightful suggestion.

Main Findings and Implications for Research

The results largely supported our theoretical framework and offer
several implications for the strategic HRM research. First, we found that
managers’ reports of HPWS were positively related to employees’ reports
of the store’s concern for customers and concern for employees. This
ﬁnding provides evidence for the multiple stakeholder perspective of work
climates (Borucki & Burke, 1999; Burke et al., 1992), which argues that
employees may cognitively appraise their work environments in terms
of the signiﬁcance both to their own and to the customers’ well-being.
Our ﬁndings also extended Burke and colleagues’ work by demonstrating
HPWS as the antecedents of multiple work climates and showing that
the HR practices of a HPWS were positively associated with employee
perceptions about the extent to which the organization cares about the
employees as well as the customers.

Second, we found that the climate of concern for customers medi-
ated the relationship between HPWS and employee service performance,
whereas the climate of concern for employees mediated the relationship
between HPWS and employee helping behavior provided to coworkers.
Researchers have argued that employees’ perceptions and interpretation
of the HR practices, rather than the actual HR practices themselves, di-
rectly inﬂuence employee attitude and behavior (cf. Gerhart, Wright, &
McMahan, 2000; Wright et al., 2005). This study provides empirical evi-
dence for this notion by showing that climates mediated the relationships
between HPWS and employee behaviors. Our study also adds to the
limited research that has examined climate as the mediating mechanism
between HPWS and employee attitudes (i.e., Takeuchi et al., 2009) by
examining dual climates simultaneously, by including manager-evaluated
employee collective performance as the outcome, and by extending the
investigation to the service context. The results suggest that when employ-
ees perceive that the store expects, supports, and rewards excellent service
through implementing HPWS practices, they are more likely to provide
high-quality service to customers. This ﬁnding also provides evidence for
the motivational effect of service climate (Liao & Chuang, 2007) and cor-
roborates past research that shows a positive relationship between service
climate and collective service performance (e.g., Borucki & Burke, 1999).
In addition, the results suggest that when employees perceive that the store
values their contributions and cares about their well-being via supportive
HR practices, they reciprocate with cooperative behavior toward cowork-
ers. This ﬁnding extends prior investigation by Piercy et al. (2006) on the
relationship between individual perception of an organization’s concern
for employees and employee OCB at the individual level of analysis to
demonstrate a positive relationship between the shared perceptions of the


180

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

climate of concern for employees and employee helping behavior at the
business-unit level of analysis.

Third, we found that both types of employee behaviors (i.e., service
performance and helping behavior) contribute to the business unit’s market
performance in terms of market share, sales growth, and proﬁtability. In
addition, the long-chain mediation tests revealed that a unit’s HPWS
was indirectly and positively related to the unit’s market performance
ﬁrst via establishing favorable dual climates of concern for employees
and concern for customers, and then via motivating employee service
performance and helping behavior. Because our research model involves
a three-path mediation model (Taylor et al., 2008), the path coefﬁcients for
the indirect effect tend to be substantially lower than would be observed
for a traditional two-path mediation model. Nonetheless, our proposed
intervening variables transmitted 45% of the effect of HPWS on the unit’s
market performance. Accordingly, we conclude that the mediating roles of
the dual climates of concern for customers and concern for employees as
well as employee cooperative behaviors toward customers and coworkers
are substantial and should not be neglected. This ﬁnding thus adds to
the growing yet still much limited literature on the speciﬁc mechanism
through which HPWS contributes to business performance and sheds light
on the speciﬁc process in the service context.

There are also a couple of intriguing ﬁndings that were not consistent
with our expectations. First, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship
between the climate of concern for customers and employee behavior of
helping coworkers. A possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that, because
in this study service was primarily provided by an individual employee,
front-line employees did not have much opportunity to help each other
in serving customers. It is also plausible that other forms of OCB may
be more closely associated with a unit’s climate of concern for customers
in service organizations (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993). For example,
employees who perceive that the unit takes service quality seriously may
take initiatives to improve service delivery by engaging in voice behavior
(LePine & Van Dyne, 2001) such as providing information about customer
needs and making constructive suggestions to management (Bettencourt
et al., 2001). We encourage future studies to explore the relationship
between the climate of concern for customers and other forms of OCB
behaviors.

Second, we also found a lack of signiﬁcant relationship between con-
cern for employees and service performance, which is inconsistent with
the results of Borucki and Burke (1999). The nonsigniﬁcant ﬁnding is
not rare. Among the few studies that included job performance as an
outcome variable, employee perceptions of the organization concerns for
them have sometimes failed to predict in-role performance ratings (e.g.,


CHUANG AND LIAO

181

Settoon, Bennett, & Liden, 1996; Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997). The
nonsigniﬁcant relationship might be attributed to the issue of measure-
ment (Sowinski, Fortmann, & Lezotte, 2008). As used in Takeuchi et al.
(2009), the scale used in this study focused on a global perception of the
extent to which an organization cares about and values its employees.
Borucki and Burke (1999), on the other hand, measured several aspects of
organizational practices. It leaves future research to investigate how mea-
surement or other factors may affect the relationship between the climate
of concern for employees and service performance.

Study Strength and Limitations

In addition to its theoretical extensions and implications, this study
contributes to the literature methodologically in terms of its study design.
First, although scholars have recognized the importance of HR practices in
fostering organizational climate and encouraging employee performance
in the service context (Borucki & Burke, 1999; Schneider & Bowen, 1992),
prior studies typically used data from stores of the same organization,
in which HR practices tend to be relatively homogenous. The lack of
sufﬁcient variability might have resulted in nonsigniﬁcant ﬁndings (e.g.,
Liao & Chuang, 2004). This study collected data from a larger number
of stores from different organizations, allowing greater variability in the
measure of HR practices in our sample, and then to have greater statistical
power to detect the effects of HPWS.

Second, as noted in Wright et al. (2005), past research has primarily
relied on asking retrospective questions or collecting concurrent data to
examine the relationship between HR practices and performance, making
it impossible to draw causal conclusions. In this study, a store manager
rated HR practices and employees rated climate variables respectively
in the ﬁrst phase, and collective employee performance and unit market
performance were mostly assessed by different managers in the second
phase. Although not a longitudinal study, this predictive design gave us
more conﬁdence to rule out the possibility of reverse causality among
variables. In addition, collecting data from various sources further reduced
common method bias and assisted our examination of the associations of
HR practices with employee climate perceptions, employee performance,
and unit performance.

Third, conducting this study in Taiwan can be considered a strength as
well. People in Taiwan increasingly care about their interests as consumers
and request better services. The government agency Consumer Protection
Commission supervises and directs the pertinent ministries and agen-
cies to carry out consumer protection mechanisms, and other nonproﬁt
groups such as Consumers’ Foundation also strive to defend the rights of


182

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

customers. Due to growing importance of services and intense competi-
tion in service organizations, customer services have drawn much atten-
tion from practitioners and scholars. More and more companies establish
customer service centers to handle customer requests and track customer
satisfaction either by themselves or by consultants. In academia, research
regarding customer services and the employees–customers interaction in
Taiwanese context has gradually received attention (e.g., Liao & Chuang,
2007; Tsai & Huang, 2002). Further, given that the theoretical arguments
of this study were basically drawn from Western research, our ﬁndings pro-
vide external validity evidence for the application of these theories in the
Chinese setting that differs from the typical Anglo-American environment.
We also acknowledge that this study has several limitations. First of
all, there might be additional factors to consider in managing a service
organization. For example, leadership can play a critical role in shaping the
climate of concern for customers (Schneider et al., 2005; Liao & Chuang,
2007) and encouraging salesperson performance (MacKenzie, Podsakoff,
& Rich, 2001). Store managers may be inﬂuential in communicating
information about management policies and practices directed toward
customers and reinforcing these management practices (Borucki & Burke,
1999). Given poor leadership, HPWS is less likely to have strong impacts
on climate perceptions and employee performance. We encourage future
research to examine the role of leadership in the relationship between
HPWS and organizational performance.

Moreover, we could not verify the interrater reliability of HPWS mea-
sures (Gerhart et al., 2000) because we only had one manager per store
to provide information of HR practices. Nevertheless, using a single rater
might be less of a concern in this sample because our focus was on the
HR practices of small stores (the mean number of employees was 13.34)
rather than those of large-scale companies. In their reply to Huselid and
Becker (2000), Gerhart et al. (2000) showed that reliability was likely to
be signiﬁcantly higher in smaller units. Despite debating on how many
respondents are needed to assess HR practices, researchers basically agree
that the most knowledgeable rater(s) should assess HR practices (Gerhart
et al., 2000; Huselid & Becker, 2000). In keeping with this advice, store
managers of our sample were very familiar with the HR practices imple-
mented in their individual stores. In addition, we focused exclusively on
the HR practices for customer-contact employees rather than those for all
employees. This focus increased the accuracy in the managers’ evalua-
tions given that HR practices might vary for different types of employees
(Wright & Boswell, 2002).

Another potential weakness of this study is that we were unable to
obtain objective measures of unit performance. Although perceptual per-
formance measures have been supported to use in research, particularly


CHUANG AND LIAO

183

for certain levels of analysis such as business units where objective mea-
sures are not feasible (Tomaskovis-Devey et al., 1994; Wall et al., 2004),
manager-reported market performance cannot be translated into a mean-
ingful metric, such as the dollar increases associated with one-standard-
deviation increase in the use of HPWS (Datta, Guthrie, & Wright, 2005;
Huselid, 1995). As a result, the impact of the ﬁndings may be limited.
Nonetheless, the large body of literature linking employee service per-
formance and extra-role behavior with desirable sales and ﬁnancial per-
formance (e.g., Borucki & Burke, 1999; Schneider et al., 2005) can be
seen as lending support to link employee behaviors and objective market
performance. Moreover, the marketing research shows that, on average,
market share has a positive effect on business proﬁtability (Szymanski,
Bharadwaj, & Varadarajan, 1993), and in the “chain of marketing pro-
ductivity” (Rust, Ambler, Carpenter, Kumar, & Srivastava, 2004), market
performance is linked to ﬁnancial performance and ﬁrm value. In addi-
tion, given that the managers in our sample were intimately familiar with
the day-to-day functioning and performance of their stores, there was a
high agreement between the two managers from the same unit about the
store’s performance and that prior research has shown a positive, sig-
niﬁcant association between objective measures and manager’s subjective
evaluation of organizational performance (Tomaskovis-Devey et al., 1994;
Wall et al., 2004), the managers’ report of market performance used in
our study should to some extent reﬂect the store’s effectiveness. Still, we
encourage future studies obtain objective performance data.

Finally, although we have provided compelling theoretical arguments
and empirical evidence supporting the mediating effect of organizational
climate in the HPWS–performance relationship after controlling the ef-
fect of employees’ customer knowledge, we recognize that there are other
potential mediators. HPWS may inﬂuence organizational performance by
enhancing employees’ ability and motivation and providing them oppor-
tunities to perform jobs well (Batt, 2002; Boxall & Purcell, 2002; Lepak
et al., 2006). Future research exploring other mediating mechanisms to
replicate and extend our ﬁndings or even examining mediators that reﬂect
ability–motivation–opportunity aspects simultaneously can provide more
comprehensive insights.

Managerial Implications

The ﬁndings of this study raise several important implications for
managers to consider. From the standpoint of people management, our
results suggest that building good relations with employees and with
customers via implementing HPWS practices may be associated with
increased organizational performance.

PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY

Facing today’s global competition, whether a company can survive and
thrive to a large extent depends on the company’s market performance in
marketing, sales growth, proﬁtability, and market share. This study adds to
the growing body of service linkage research and demonstrates that front-
line employees, who make contact with customers on a daily basis and
largely determine customer perceptions of service quality, play a critical
role in a unit’s market performance. In particular, service organizations
may gain better market performance by enhancing front-line employees’
task and contextual performance. Speciﬁcally, we found that 1 standard
deviation increase in employee service performance and helping behavior
was associated with .50 standard deviation increase in manager’s report
of the unit’s market performance. Given the estimate of a .52 correlation
between manager’s perceived and actual ﬁrm performance (Wall et al.,
2004), we can expect one standard deviation increase in employee ser-
vice performance and helping behavior was associated with .26 standard
deviation increase in the unit’s actual market performance. In Taiwan, a
CommonWealth4 top 500 service company’s average annual sales growth
is about $38.65 million (SD = $249.63 million), the average proﬁt after
tax is about $15.74 million (SD = $109.95 million), and the average proﬁt
margin ratio (proﬁtability) is around 5.14% (SD = 17.01%; Common-
Wealth, 20085). Therefore, one standard deviation increase in employee
service performance and helping behavior could potentially boost these
bottom line measures by approximately $64.90 million for sales growth,
$28.59 million for proﬁt after tax, and 4.42% for proﬁt margin ration. Al-
though they were drawn from large companies, these estimates suggested
that employee behaviors of serving customers and helping coworkers
could make a signiﬁcant impact on organizational bottom-line measures.
Our study also offers concrete suggestions on how to elicit these ben-
eﬁcial employee behaviors. We found that the HR practices of HPWS
may play an important role. Speciﬁcally, the HPWS practices can foster a
climate of concern for customers that facilitates good service performance
and a climate of concern for employees that motivates helping behavior
among coworkers. HR, as a core function of internal management, has

4Having received over 15 awards from the Society of Publishers in Asia since 2005 and

service industry each year since 1986.

5CommonWealth provided information of proﬁt after tax and proﬁt margin ratio. Sales
growth was computed from sales and sales growth rate. We keyed in all ﬁgures of the 500
companies for the Year 2007 and calculated the statistics (mean and standard deviation) by
using SPSS. The ﬁgures were presented in Taiwanese dollars and were converted into US
dollars at an exchange rate of 32.5 Taiwanese dollars to 1 US dollar.

traditionally taken an internal orientation (Schneider & White, 2004) with
a predominant focus on attending to internal employees’ well-being. Our
results suggest that it is beneﬁcial for HR managers to work across func-
tional boundaries. In particular, HR managers may work closely with the
marketing department, utilizing the intimate knowledge marketing man-
agers have on external customers to gain a better understanding of cus-
tomer needs and expectations. Such cross-functional cooperation efforts
may help HR managers to better design and implement a comprehensive
HPWS of practices such as stafﬁng, training, employee involvement, com-
pensation and performance management practices with speciﬁc attention
to the interests of not only the employees but also the customers.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HRM practices of a HPWS
may facilitate both the climate of concern for customers and the climate
of concern for employees, which may respectively encourage employees
to engage in cooperative behaviors with customers and coworkers that
are essential in achieving superior market performance. These ﬁndings
integrate the strategic HRM research with the multiple-stakeholder view
of organizational climate by Burke et al. (1992) and shed light on the
inﬂuence mechanism of HPWS on organizational effectiveness in the
service context.
