A firm’s reputation is perhaps one of its most important strategic resources. Using data from For-
tune’s America’s Most Admired Companies survey, this article examines how layoffs affect the
reputations of firms. The authors found that layoffs have a negative impact on a firm’s reputation
and that this relationship is significantly stronger for newer firms than older firms. Limited sup-
port is found for the hypothesis that larger firms’ reputations will be buffered from the adverse
effects of a layoff on their reputations. Implications of this research and future research questions
are discussed.

In this article, we investigate the impact of layoffs on corporate reputations. A firm’s repu-
tation is perhaps one of its most important strategic resources (Ferguson, Deephouse, & Fer-
guson, 2000). In fact, a firm’s reputation is related to its ability to sustain its competitive
advantage and to recover from below-average performance (Roberts & Dowling, 2002). This
advantage is not easy to develop, as reputations are notoriously difficult to improve. As a result
of the value flowing from a positive reputation and the difficulty improving a reputation, firms
go to great lengths to build and maintain their reputations.

Fombrun defined reputation as “a perceptual representation of a company’s past actions
and future prospects that describe the firm’s overall appeal to all its key constituents when
compared to other leading rivals” (1996: 72). Reputation has similarly been expressed as the
jointly held belief about the underlying characteristics of an actor (Weigelt & Camerer, 1988;
Rao, 1994). Roberts and Dowling (2002) expanded on these definitions to indicate that reputa-

tion manifests itself as the extent to which the firm is seen as “good” and not “bad.” Because
reputation is “determined by the value (quality) of the actor’s previous efforts” (Podolny &
Phillips, 1996: 455), it is important that a firm consider the impact its current actions will have
on its future reputation. Each strategic choice that a firm makes will not only have the direct
impact of changing its competitive position but also will affect its reputation. For example,
although Microsoft’s strategic choice to tie its Internet browser to its operating system had the
strategic impact of improving its position in browser software, it also had a reputation effect.
Many consumers/stakeholders viewed it as a bully. It is against this backdrop that we consider
the impact that layoffs have on the reputation of a firm.

Many view layoffs as a tool managers can use to improve performance by cutting costs.
Seen in this light, layoffs could have a positive impact on reputation. However, empirical evi-
dence suggests that the gains to performance are elusive. In fact, whereas some researchers
have found increases in firm performance (Wayhan & Werner, 2000) or no significant change
in performance (Mentzer, 1996) following layoffs, the majority of research findings reveal a
poor reception by the stock market and declining financial performance in the years following
a layoff (Cascio, Young, & Morris, 1997; Chen, Mehrotra, Sivakumar, & Yu, 2001; De Meuse,
Vanderheiden, & Bergmann, 1994; Hallock, 1998; Lee, 1997; Pouder, Cantrell, & Kulkarni,
1999; Worrell, Davidson, & Sharma, 1991). These studies suggest that the reduction in human
resource expenses that follow a layoff is often accompanied by an unintended increase in the
cost of organizing and motivating employees. If, along with these increased organizational
costs, a firm suffers a costly decline in reputation, then the viability of layoffs as a strategic tool
comes increasingly into question.

Theory

The Impact of Layoffs on Firms

Part of the difficulty in determining how layoffs will affect a firm’s reputation is that, in
general, the association between layoffs and performance is complex. Layoffs can affect vari-
ous parts of an organization in a variety of ways. At the micro-organizational level, layoffs are
suggested to have almost entirely negative influences on the employees who survive the lay-
offs. At the macro-organizational level, layoffs are alleged to have both positive and negative
effects.

At the micro-organizational level, workforce reductions may both lead to the loss of key
knowledge resources and a reduction in the motivation of those that remain (Wayhan &
Werner, 2000). Employee commitment declines following layoffs (Brockner, Grover, Reed,
DeWitt, & O’Malley, 1987), with high performers more likely to leave the firm (Bedeian &
Armenakis, 1998; Brockner & Lee, 1995). Other negative effects on employees include a
decrease in satisfaction, work climate, and trust and an increase in absenteeism, union griev-
ances, fear, and guilt (Brockner, 1988; Brockner, Grover, Reed, DeWitt, & O’Malley, 1987;
Buch & Aldridge, 1991; Wagar, 2001). The negative consequences of layoffs for employees
even extend to their health (Kivimaki, Vahtera, Pentti, & Ferrie, 2000). In sum, empirical
results show a variety of negative influences that layoffs have on employees.

Layoffs also have an impact on the internal functioning of organizations, particularly in
terms of how employees are connected. Changes in informal communication networks may
reduce the ability of downsized firms to share information (Dougherty & Bowman, 1995;
Fisher & White, 2000; Lei & Hitt, 1995; Shah, 2000). Through these disruptions to informa-
tion sharing, downsizing has the potential to damage the firm’s learning and memory capabili-
ties (Fisher & White, 2000). Consistent with these arguments, Amabile and Conti (1999)
reported that perceptions of creativity decline following layoffs.

At the macro-organizational level, it is generally assumed that layoffs are a strategic choice
designed to lower costs. Wayhan and Werner (2000) suggested that layoffs can have a positive
impact on firms from a competitive advantage perspective and a negative impact from a
resource-based perspective. According to the competitive advantage perspective, layoffs are
intended to reduce the firm’s cost structure, thereby enhancing its competitive position
(Cascio et al., 1997). Consistent with this logic, layoffs are often seen as a response to the
increasing pressure for top managers to produce short-term results (Kets de Vries & Balazs,
1997).

Another perspective on layoffs is based on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm
(Penrose, 1959; Wernerfelt, 1984). According to the resource-based view of the firm, perfor-
mance advantages accrue to the firm possessing resources that allow it to deliver products or
services that customers value at a price-to-performance relationship that competitors cannot
readily imitate (Barney, 1991). Human resources are among the most important resources
upon which firms build resource-based advantages due to the inimitable nature of the tacit
knowledge and skills that employees possess (Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001;
Lado & Wilson, 1994; Wright, Dunford, & Snell, 2001).

Human resources can create RBV strategic advantage in two ways (Boxall, 1996). First,
individuals can possess knowledge, skills, and abilities that enable them to perform activities
that lead to valuable, difficult-to-imitate output for their firm. Second, groups of employees
within the firm can, through their shared knowledge, skills, and abilities, jointly produce valu-
able, difficult-to-copy output. This second type, which Barney (1991) called a socially com-
plex resource, is potentially the most valuable because it cannot be easily copied. Also, it is
likely the most vulnerable to layoffs. Because the firm may be able to identify and protect its
most valuable employees, a layoff can be designed to keep the individuals that matter most.
Socially complex resources, however, are much more difficult to identify and protect during a
layoff and will more likely be damaged. Consistent with the resource-based view of strategic
human resource management (HRM), Leana and Van Buren (1999) suggested that layoffs
may undermine the buildup of organizational social capital. Combining the competitive
advantage perspective and the resource-based perspective on layoffs leads to the conclusion
that layoffs may have a short-term competitive benefit and a long-term resource-based loss.
Our main proposition in this study is that the negative impact layoffs have on a firm will
lead to decreases in outsiders’ perceptions of the firm’s future prospects and hence to a reduc-
tion in firm reputation. In addition to the deleterious effect mentioned above, layoffs have been
found to influence the impression potential employees and customers have of the organization
(Bastien, Hostager, & Miles, 1996), making them see the organization as more “bad.” Further-
more, given the limited information available that stakeholders have to build their overall per-
ceptions of a firm, layoffs will be seen as a negative signal concerning a firm’s overall reputa-

tion. Also, since reputation is seen as a signal about underlying quality (Roberts & Dowling,
2002), stakeholders will adjust down their perception of the quality of the firm when it takes
actions, such as layoffs, that have generally been found to be more harmful than helpful.

Hypothesis 1: The impact of a layoff on a firm’s reputation will be negative.

The Mitigating Role of Prelayoff Financial Performance

Reputation is the result of perceptions (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Corporate reputations
are based on how external observers perceive corporate behavior. Because observers cannot
see all the behavior of the corporation and there is ambiguity regarding the meaning of the
behavior that is seen, the observers make attributions based on the behavior they do observe.
According to attribution theory (Kelley, 1967; Weiner, 1985), observers make attributions
about the underlying characteristics of individuals or groups of individuals based on the nature
of the behavior they observe.

One of the important distinctions drawn by attribution theory concerns the extent to which
observers attribute witnessed behavior to characteristics of the actor (internal attributions)
versus attributing the behavior to characteristics of the situation (external attributions) (Kelley
& Michela, 1980; Martinko, 1995). Attribution theory suggests that when actions appear to be
caused more by the situation than by the characteristics of the actor, observers will not ascribe
the action to characteristics of the actor. When it appears that internal forces drive behavior,
observers will attribute the action to characteristics of the actor. Because, as mentioned in the
introduction, reputation is the jointly held belief about the underlying characteristics of an
actor (Rao, 1994; Weigelt & Camerer, 1988), internal attributions will affect reputation to a
greater degree than external attributions will.

We have discussed above why layoffs will have a negative influence on the reputation of
firms. We propose, however, that the strength of this negative influence will be moderated by
the extent to which layoffs are seen as internal and hence representative of the characteristics
of the firm rather than driven by external factors. We posit that layoffs by below-average per-
formers will be attributed more to external forces (such as market pressures). Layoffs by these
firms will be seen as more legitimate, given the firm’s situation, than layoffs by above-average
performers. Charness and Levine suggested and found support for the notion that “people con-
sider it fairer for an employer to react to an exogenous shock than to take the initiative and
cause harm” (2000: 386). This legitimacy will drive the notion that the managers of poor-
performing firms are reacting to their situation and not according to their own volition. When
layoffs are viewed as legitimate, stakeholders, even those not directly affected, will attribute a
level of trustworthiness to decision makers commensurate with the perceptions of legitimacy
of the event (Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997; Leana & Feldman, 1992). This is
consistent with other research that shows a smaller negative response to layoffs by employees
when the employees attribute the layoffs to legitimate factors beyond the control of managers
(Brockner et al., 1987; Turnley & Feldman, 1998).

Hypothesis 2: The negative impact of a layoff on a firm’s reputation will be moderated by firm perfor-

mance. High-performing firms will show a larger decline in reputation.

The Mitigating Role of the Age and Size of the Firm

A firm’s current reputation is based on the accumulated actions of its past, that is, its stock
of actions. The greater the time or the larger the set of visible prior actions that make up the
stock, the more developed and stable will be the reputation. The flows of reputation are the
current actions that are being added to the stock of prior actions. Thus, the number of past
observable actions that define the current reputation (its “thinness” or “thickness”) will influ-
ence how much weight stakeholders will give to new observable actions. In effect, for firms
with thick reputations, a single action will not have as large an impact on reputation as it will
for firms with thin reputations.

We suggest that both younger firms and smaller firms have thinner, and therefore less sta-
ble, reputations. Accordingly, these firms’ reputations will be more strongly affected by a lay-
off announcement.

With regard to firm age, we believe that younger firms will suffer from a form of “liability
of newness.” Their reputations will be based on fewer observed behaviors and tend to be more
volatile. This will make their reputations more susceptible to decreases due to the announce-
ment of a negative event such as a layoff. For a newer firm, there is a great deal of ambiguity
regarding how well the observed behaviors of the firm accurately reflect the firm’s underlying
characteristics. This ambiguity leads observers to place greater weight on the few actions that
they do observe. It follows that the reputations of these firms are likely less stable than the rep-
utations of older firms. Rao (1994) suggested that the establishment of reputation is the exter-
nal part of the liability of newness that Stinchcombe (1965) proposed. Rao (1994) proposed
and found evidence for the supposition that positive events have a stronger, positive impact on
the survival of new firms than for existing firms. This is consistent with our notion that the rep-
utations of younger firms are more highly influenced by the negative impact of layoffs.

Hypothesis 3: The negative impact of a layoff on a firm’s reputation will be moderated by firm age.

Younger firms will show a larger decline in reputation.

We also posit that smaller firms will be more susceptible to the negative reputation effects
of layoffs. Similar to the argument above about newer firms, smaller firms will tend to have
thinner, less stable reputations than large firms. For a smaller firm, the amount of ambiguity
regarding the underlying characteristics of the firm is based on its lack of visibility (Goldberg,
Cohen, & Figenbaum, 2003). Visibility has been established as a driver of reputation (Carroll
& McCombs, 2003; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990), and larger firms are more visible (Greve &
Fujiwara-Greve, 2003). Therefore, the reputations of smaller firms will tend to be based on a
smaller number of observed behaviors. Studying Danish firms, Schultz, Mouritsen, and
Gabrielsen (2001) suggested greater stability of reputation among large firms. For larger
firms, the great amount of visible activities they engage in will result in thick reputations (built
on many observed actions) lessening the impact of each subsequent action. For smaller firms,
each individual publicized event provides more insight into the abilities of the firm and
therefore has a larger impact on the reputation.

Smaller firms will show a larger decline in reputation.

Method

Sample

Data for this study were drawn from Fortune’s America’s Most Admired Companies
(AMAC) Survey data book. The AMAC data book contains information on a wide variety of
companies ranging from the most admired (such as Southwest Air) to the least admired (such
as Kmart). Our sample is arranged as panel data where each observation is one company in a
given year (1996 through 1998). A company/year observation was included if the company
was in the data book and had complete financial and survey information for the observation
year and the proceeding year. An observation was removed from our sample if the firm
announced a layoff during the months that the survey was conducted (September-December)
in a given year. This was done to remove observations where some AMAC respondents may
have filled out their surveys before a layoff was announced, whereas others filled theirs out
after an announcement. Our final sample has 782 observations and comprises 347 firms, each
having observations for one or more of the years 1996, 1997, or 1998.

Dependent Variable

We relied on Fortune’s AMAC data book to construct our dependent variable. Each year,
Fortune asks an independent research firm to develop rankings of the 10 largest companies in
each of a variety of industries. For each industry, executives, directors, and financial analysts
are surveyed and asked to rate the 10 firms in their industry (or, for the financial analysts, the
industry they cover) on eight dimensions using a scale from 0 (low) to 10 (high). The dimen-
sions are (a) use of corporate assets; (b) community and environmental responsibility; (c) abil-
ity to attract, develop, and keep talented people; (d) financial soundness; (e) innovativeness;
(f) value as a long-term investment; (g) quality of management; and (h) quality of products or
services. These dimensions are then averaged into an “overall reputation score” for each com-
pany. The survey draws from a large sample of respondents. The 1998 sample, for instance,
comprised responses from more than 12,000 individuals. Fortune does not publish response
rates to yearly surveys but boasts a response rate approaching 50% across the survey’s 17-year
history. An excellent, more in-depth, description of the data collection process can be found in
Roberts and Dowling (2002).

Arguments have been developed and empirical evidence found that support the validity and
reliability of the Fortune AMAC database (Simerly, 1999; Szwajkowski & Figlewicz, 1999).
The data, either for the overall reputation scores or for the individual dimensions, have been
widely used in past research (see, e.g., Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Gatewood, Gowan, &
Lautenschlager, 1993; Hammond & Slocum, 1996; McGuire, Schneeweis, & Branch, 1990;
Roberts & Dowling, 2002; Wartick, 1992).


Flanagan, O’Shaughnessy / Effect of Layoffs

451

We acknowledge, however, that there is some controversy regarding the use of individual
measures on specific dimensions of the Fortune data. Fombrun and Shanley (1990), for
instance, argue that the eight attributes, when combined as an index, are components of an
underlying and stable construct of corporate reputation. They report that their index measure
has an alpha of .97, and factor analysis revealed one underlying factor that accounted for 84%
of the variance with an eigenvalue of 6.68 (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 245). Replicating their
tests using our data sample revealed nearly identical results (α = 97.4, one factor with an
eigenvalue of 6.83 that accounted for 85.4% of the overall variance). Thus, the evidence
regarding the appropriateness of using an overall index of the eight measures is strong. This
leads to us being less certain, however, of the appropriateness of using the data on the individ-
ual dimensions separately. Indeed, Fomburn and Shanley (1990) contended that the pattern of
correlations among the dimensions suggests that using them individually is not advisable
because they are not conceptually or empirically distinct. Brown and Perry (1994) built upon
this argument.

Because our hypotheses deal with a firm’s overall reputation, we are confident that each
firm’s overall reputation score from the Fortune database is a good measure to employ in this
study. However, we also test the impact of a layoff announcement on each of the eight individ-
ual reputation measures. Although we believe that layoff announcements will have a negative
impact on each of the eight components, specifically testing this assumption is a worthy exer-
cise. We also suggest and test the notion that although the relationships will all be negative,
some may be stronger than others. For example, human resource activities have had an impor-
tant impact on human resource reputations (e.g., Chauvin & Guthrie, 1994) and thus, activities
like layoffs may have a larger impact on human resource components of reputation than they
will have on other components of reputation.

Independent and Moderating Variables

Layoff. Observations where the firm had a layoff in a given year were identified using a
dummy variable set to one when a layoff announcement was reported in the Wall Street Jour-
nal abstracts. Wall Street Journal abstracts were searched using a broad set of terms (layoff,
layoffs, job cuts, downsizing, or restructuring) for the years 1995 to 1998. The abstract of each
article was examined for evidence of a layoff announcement. The announced layoffs were
then compared to the list of firms in the Fortune database. For each layoff by a firm in the For-
tune database, the layoff variable is coded as one for that year.

Prior performance. Performance is measured as industry-adjusted return on assets (ROA)
the year before the observation year. Industry-adjusted ROA has been the most commonly
used performance measure in the literature (Roberts & Dowling, 2002). Returns and assets
values (as well as the other financial values used in this study) were obtained from
COMPUSTAT.

Journal of Management / June 2005

Firm age. Age was calculated by subtracting the date of founding for each firm from the
observation year. Founding dates were obtained from Standard and Poors’ Register of
Corporations.

Organizational size. The size of firms is measured as the industry-adjusted log of sales.

Control Variables

To account for movements in performance and firm size over time, we also included ROA
and the log of sales in the observation year. Thus, our model has both contemporaneous and
lagged values of ROA and organizational size. In addition, we included contemporaneous and
lagged values of risk and price to book (both adjusted for industry). These variables were
included to account for the financial halo in the Fortune measures found in past research
(Brown & Perry, 1994). Furthermore, we included a variable for prior year layoff in the model
to control for any residual effect that a layoff in the previous year might have had on firm repu-
tation. Finally, 56 dummy variables were included to account for the 57 industries covered by
the firms in our sample as defined by Fortune. All financial data were obtained from
COMPUSTAT, and all industry classification data were obtained from the AMAC data book.

Table 1 provides summary data on the variables. Seventy-two of our 782 observations
involved firms that announced layoffs during an observation year. Layoffs occurred in firms in
32 of the 57 industries in our sample. The industries of firms reporting layoffs were wide-
spread. Various manufacturing, transportation, raw material, health care, and financial service
industries were all included. The greatest number of layoffs reported in an industry was 5, and
the mean number of layoffs per industry was 1.3 with a standard deviation of 1.5.

Statistical Technique

The data were analyzed using ordinary least squares regression. The reputation of the firm
in time t is the dependent variable, and the reputation in time t – 1 is an independent variable.
Allison (1990) pointed out, however, that, at times, using a change score approach is more
appropriate than using the regressor approach and that the choice of which approach to use is
rarely obvious. Therefore, we also conducted our analysis using the change in reputation from
time t – 1 to time t as the dependent variable. We found that the results were consistent across
methods, and for the sake of parsimony, do not report the latter set of results.

Results

The results of our regression analysis are shown in Table 2. The coefficient for layoffs is
negative (b = –.4359) and significant at the .001 level for the regression with composite (over-
all) reputation as the dependent variable. This supports Hypothesis 1. This result is consistent
across all of the models employing the various submeasures of overall reputation. Thus, we
find that the relationship between layoffs and reputation is consistently negative.

Flanagan, O’Shaughnessy / Effect of Layoffs

457

Hypothesis 2, that the relationship between layoffs and reputation is moderated by prior
firm performance, is not supported. The coefficient on the interaction term between layoffs
and prior firm performance is not significant.

Hypothesis 3 is tested by the interaction term Layoffs × Age. This interaction term is statis-
tically significant (p < .01) in the predicted direction (b = .0035) when overall reputation is
used as the dependent variable. This finding supports Hypothesis 3. Support for this hypothe-
sis is reasonably consistent across the various components of overall reputation. Only when
“innovativeness” is used as the dependent variable is the coefficient not significant at tradi-
tionally used levels. The coefficient is, however, positive (as predicted) and significant at p =
.06. Figure 1 points out how the negative impact of layoffs on reputation is substantially larger
for newer firms than it is for older firms using the coefficients estimated when overall
reputation is used as the dependent variable.

We find only limited support for Hypothesis 4, that firm size moderates the relationship
between layoffs and overall reputation. The interaction term for size and layoffs is significant
using traditional cutoffs for three of the components of reputation (community/environment,
financial soundness, product quality) but is only marginally significant (p = .056) for the com-
posite measure of reputation. Figure 2 graphically shows, using the coefficients estimated
when overall reputation is used as the dependent variable, how the impact of layoffs on
reputation is moderated by firm size.

Although Table 2 shows that some estimated coefficients for certain layoff variables fall
below (or above) traditionally used cutoff levels for significance (i.e., p < .05), we need to do
additional analysis to determine whether the actual magnitudes of the estimated coefficients
are different when overall reputation is used as the dependent variable as compared to each
component measure. Following the procedures outlined in Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken
(2003), we tested whether layoffs had a statistically different impact on any of the component
measures of reputation when compared to the overall index of reputation.

We first standardized all of the variables and reran our regression models using change
scores as the dependent variables. This allowed us to statistically compare the magnitude of
the coefficients obtained when each component of reputation is used as a dependent measure
against the coefficients obtained when an index of the other seven measures was used as a
dependent measure. Using the “other seven” as the index we were comparing a component
measure to is a stronger test than comparing the coefficient for a component to the overall,
eight-component index (which contains the component we are comparing a component to).
We had to use the change score approach, rather than the regressor method because the proce-
dure in Cohen et al. (2003) requires that only the dependent variables be different in the equa-
tions being compared. It is important to note that, as mentioned earlier, the overall results for
the tests of our four hypotheses were consistent regardless of whether a change score or the
regressor method was used.

The results of our tests of the coefficient magnitudes using different components as
dependent variables showed that, with one exception, there was no significant difference
between the parameter estimates for any of the component regressions and the estimates found
when an index of the other seven measures was used. The one exception was the coefficient
found on our layoff variable when “community/environmental responsibility” was the
dependent variable. Although negative and significant, this coefficient was statistically

smaller (less negative) than that found when an index of the other seven measures was used as
a dependent variable. In summary, with the one small exception noted above, we find that lay-
offs affect each of the components of reputation no differently than they affect overall
reputation.

Discussion

The main result of this study is that layoffs, on average, have a strong, negative impact on
corporate reputation. Using the coefficients we obtained for the main and interaction effects
and the average values for firm age, size, and performance in our sample, we find that the aver-
age firm experienced a reduction of .22 points in its overall reputation score when it
announced a layoff. This is a substantial drop equal to almost a quarter of one standard devia-
tion of reputation (SD = 0.90). Although the impact of layoffs on corporate financial perfor-
mance is somewhat unclear, this study shows that the average impact on corporate reputation
is clearly negative. On average, then, managers can expect that performance will decline and
reputation will falter after layoffs. It could be that managers assume (often incorrectly) that,
given their firm and its situation, reputation will not be negatively affected.

Our results do show that age is a moderating factor in that older firms appear to be buffered
from the adverse reputation effects of a layoff. This finding has implications for both the litera-
ture on reputations and the literature on layoffs. The greater cost to reputations that layoffs
bring to newer firms reinforces the notion that the reputations of newer firms are more vari-
able, which is consistent with the ideas in Rao (1994). The research investigating the impact of
layoffs on the performance of firms has largely ignored the differential impact of layoffs on
young firms. Given the research that follows Stinchcombe’s (1965) liability of newness argu-
ments, future research should investigate whether layoffs threaten the external relationships of
young firms and thereby reduce the ability of such young firms to survive.

We found limited support for the notion that firm size moderates the relationship between
layoffs and reputation. Combining the support for age as a moderator and the limited support
for size as a moderator, though, implies that the thinness of reputation argument we proposed
is fairly well supported by our results. This suggests a path for future research investigating
how the characteristics of firms influence the stability of reputations. Fombrun and Shanley
(1990) argued that the size of firms is positively associated with mean differences in reputation
but did not address the stability or variability of reputation. It would be interesting to under-
stand how characteristics such as size and age of firms are related to both the mean and
variance of reputation.

We did not find support for the hypothesis that prior financial performance moderates the
impact of layoffs on reputation. Although we expected that, due to attributions about internal
versus external causality, the layoff penalty to reputations would be higher for firms with
strong financial performance, we do not uncover support for this idea. Particularly considering
the influence that financial performance has on reputation, future research using alternative
performance measures and other firm characteristics as moderating variables is warranted.
Managers may also assume (again, incorrectly on average) that, given the way they intend to
implement a layoff, their firm’s reputation will be spared. Although this article did look at some
of the characteristics of the companies instituting layoffs, we did not examine specific character-
istics of the layoffs themselves. Future research could look at how factors such as the size of the
layoff, whether it was part of a facility shutdown, whether multiple layoffs were announced, or
the level of the organization where the job losses occurred affect the reputation effect.

Overall, the findings in this study regarding the impact of layoffs on the reputation of firms
also lead to questions regarding how managers manage their firms’ reputations. Although the
research on the RBV view of strategy increasingly focuses on human assets as important
sources of competitive advantage, little research has considered how some of the choices that
firms enact may have long-term harmful influences on the ability of the firm to develop human
asset-based RBV advantages. A firm’s reputation as a high-quality employer, for instance, has
been shown to be valuable (Chauvin & Guthrie, 1994).

This study also sheds some additional light on characteristics of the Fortune reputation
database. We find that layoffs affect each of the eight Fortune reputation dimensions in very
similar ways. This supports the notion proposed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990) that the eight
dimensions are empirically indistinguishable from each other and really reflect one underly-
ing dimension of reputation. The only statistical difference we could find when using the vari-
ous components of reputation as dependent variables was for the community/environmental
responsibility component. Although layoffs still had a significant, negative impact on this
measure, the impact was not as large (less negative) than that found when an index of the other
seven measures was used as a dependent variable. Szwajkowski and Figlewicz (1999) con-
tended that the community/environment measure should really be broken up into two separate
questions in the Fortune survey because they are really two distinct components. Our results
may lend some support to their position. It could be, for instance, that a layoff involving the
closing of an old plant could be viewed as having a negative impact on a community but a less
negative or even a positive impact on the environment. Thus, it may not be surprising that,
although we find that the overall impact of a layoff on a firm’s community/environment rating
is negative, the impact is not as strong as that found for other components of reputation.

A few limitations of our study are notable. First, our reputation measure, although the best
measure generally available, may miss some of the elements of reputation. For example, the
influence layoffs might have on the firm’s reputation with stakeholders such as potential
employees or customers is not fully captured by the Fortune measure. Second, although we
examined a few contextual variables that might moderate the relationship between layoffs and
performance, there are certainly a number of other attributes of layoffs that would be impor-
tant for future research to consider. For example, like Charness and Levine (2000), we con-

preceding or following layoffs. Considering how important top management is for reputation,
future research could consider how layoffs, changes in top management, and reputations all
covary.

One methodological issue that warrants further research has to do with how performance
variables (such as ROA, ROE, or stock returns) are industry adjusted. Like many other
researchers (e.g., Buchholtz, Ribbens, & Houle, 2003), we adjust for industry effects by sub-
tracting average industry performance from an individual’s performance. However, this effec-
tively constitutes the use of a difference score, and difference scores have been criticized as
having methodological problems (Edwards, 1995). Future research investigating potential
problems with industry-adjusted firm performance measures, the magnitude of these prob-
lems, and potential alternatives (especially with regard to the moderator variable case) would
be useful.

If corporate reputations are indeed sources of competitive advantage (Deephouse, 2000),
then a deeper understanding of how those reputations are built and maintained is warranted.
Furthermore, given the incidence of layoffs, their social costs, and their dubious impacts on
financial performance, continued research on layoffs is clearly justified. Our study adds to the
reputation and layoff literatures by showing the powerful influence layoffs can have on
corporate reputations.
