The strategic HR literature suggests that a firm will perform better through
internal appropriate fit among HRM practices (the configuration fit) and
through external appropriate fit between a firm’s HRM practices and busi-
ness strategy. The present study adopts a configuration approach to iden-
tify unique patterns of HR practices and business strategy that are posited
to be maximally effective. The proposed relationships were empirically
tested by surveying with a sample of 241 business firms in Guangzhou,
South China, to find out the extent that four HR configurations could be
successfully adopted in the Chinese context. The results revealed that HR
configurations are significantly related to effect in predicting overall out-
come performance and turnover, but not significantly related to effect on
sales growth and profit growth rates. Research findings showed not only
competitive strategies are significantly related to effect on HR configura-
tions. The results also showed significant interaction effects between HR
configurations and business strategy in their effect on profit and sales
growth. These results further extended support for a contingency perspec-
tive in strategic HRM to the Chinese context, with significant practical im-
plications for managing HRM in China. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

IntroductionO ver  the  last  two  decades,  there  has

been  considerable  interest  in  using
the configuration approach to study
the  role  human  resource  manage-
ment practices play in contributing
to  an  organization’s  sustained  competitive
advantage.  Organizational  configuration
refers  to  “any  multidimensional  constella-
tion  of  conceptually  distinct  characteristics
that  commonly  occur  together”  (Meyer,
Tsui, & Hinings, 1993, p. 1175). Configura-

tion  approaches  focus  on  the  realized  pat-
tern  of  multiple  variables,  how  these  vari-
ables  interact  over  time,  and  how  the  pat-
tern  relates  to  various  organizational
outcomes (Delery & Doty, 1996; Ketchen et
al.,  1997).  The  configuration  literature  is
grounded  in  structural  contingency  theory
(Meyer et al., 1993). HRM strategies must be
combined with specific business competitive
strategies  if  they  are  to  enhance  organiza-
tional performance. 

Sustainable  HRM  systems  are  those  that
are  internally  coherent  and  consistent  with

HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Winter 2008

Given the different

environment of the

socialist market

and the rapid

growth of China’s

economy, it would

be interesting to

find out how

effective HR

management might

affect

organizational

performance in the

world’s largest

both the firm’s corporate strategy and with the
broader  context  in  which  the  firm  is  operat-
ing.  The  underlying  logic  is  the  assumption
that congruence or fit would result in organi-
zational effectiveness (Delery, 1998). The con-
tingency  of  a  strategic  approach
emphasizes that HR practices need
to  be  contingent  upon  the  firm’s
business strategy to be effective. To
more  effectively  gain  competitive
advantage, it is important to inte-
grate  HRM  with  business  strategy
(Gunnigle  &  Moore,  1994).  This
can best be understood by identify-
ing  distinct,  internally  consistent
sets of HR practices and their rela-
tionships  to  organization’s  busi-
ness strategy and performance out-
comes. The present study adopts a
configuration approach to identify
unique  patterns  of  HR  practices
and  business  strategy  that  are
posited to be maximally effective. 
The majority of previous stud-
ies on this topic were based in the
Western  context.  Current  studies
in China focus largely on foreign-
invested enterprises (FIEs) or joint
ventures (Bjorkman & Fan, 2002;
Ding & Akhtar, 2001). To date in
China,  very  little  systematic,
large-scale  surveying  has  been
done on managing the human re-
source.  Yet  because  one-fifth  of
the  world’s  population  lives  in
China,  understanding  how  to
manage its labor force not only is
useful  to  researchers  and  practi-
tioners,  but  also  could  have  an  important
impact  on  China’s  reform  programs.  Given
the  different  institutional  environment  of
the socialist market and the rapid growth of
China’s economy, it would be interesting to
find  out  how  effective  HR  management
might  affect  organizational  performance  in
the world’s largest transitional economy. De-
spite the abundant supply of labor in China,
HR professionals found that fewer than 10%
of Chinese job applicants have the skills re-
quired for jobs in foreign companies (Farrell
&  Grant,  2005).  Such  findings  are  particu-

larly alarming since HR practices have been
identified as key drivers of employee engage-
ment.  In  the  context  of  the  Chinese  econ-
omy, what are the key elements of HR prac-
tices 
to  better
performance? 

that  may  contribute 

The present study fills the gap by exam-
ining the extent of adoption of HRM config-
urations in South China, particularly while it
transitions  from  a  centrally  planned  econ-
omy  to  a  market  economy.  If  organizations
want  to  gain  a  competitive  advantage  by
continually  developing  personnel  expertise,
the  adoption  of  HR  systems  will  become
more prevalent in China. China’s emergence
in the global economy provides a rich con-
text  for  this  study.  As  more  multinational
firms  enter  the  China  market,  results  from
the present study can offer some insights for
researchers and practitioners alike.

China introduced market reforms in the
early 1980s. Admission into the World Trade
Organization, together with the presence of
FIEs, has changed the competitive landscape.
Under  pressure  to  compete  globally,  China
accelerated  its  transition  to  a  more  market-
oriented  economy.  HR  practices  have  been
moving away from a highly centralized allo-
cation process to a more market-driven and
performance-based  system.  The  HRM  prac-
tices are influenced by environmental, insti-
tutional, and organizational conditions. The
transitional  Chinese  economy  is  not  a  free
market. Most enterprises are still constrained
by  government  regulations  and  interven-
tion. The conventional “Western model” of
HRM  may  not  fully  capture  the  HR  chal-
lenges facing firms in China. Therefore, HR
practices  must  be  modified  to  fit  China’s
unique cultural and institutional context. 

Building on the current research, this ar-
ticle attempts to explore more systematically
the relationships between HR practices, busi-
ness strategies, and firm performance using a
configuration approach in the Chinese con-
text. In addition, we examine the interaction
effects of HRM and business strategy on both
financial and behavioral aspects of firm per-
formance. The findings complement existing
literature on the configuration perspective in
HRM  research.  Empirical  results  offer  some

evidence  of  the  magnitude  of  the  relation-
ship  among  HR  practices  and  the  effects  of
the  interaction  between  business  strategy
and firm performance. The findings offer im-
portant  insights  for  multinational  business
executives who are looking to formulate ef-
fective HRM strategies and align their firm’s
business strategy to attain high-performance
results in China.

The following section begins with a brief
review of existing research on HR configura-
tion and business strategy. Based on a review
of  the  literature,  hypotheses  are  developed
and tested with empirical data collected for
this study. The article concludes with a dis-
cussion  of  managerial  implications  and  fu-
ture research direction.

Theory and Hypotheses

The  contingency  theory  posits  that  HRM
should  match  the  demand  of  the  internal
and  external  conditions  (Delery  &  Doty,
1996; Schuler & Jackson, 1987). External fit
links  HR  systems  to  business  strategy,
whereas internal fit focuses on HRM practice
configurations 
complementarities
across  HRM  activities  positively  impact  or-
ganization  [Wright  &  Snell,  1991]).  There-
fore, integrating HR configuration with busi-
ness  strategy  is  conducive  to  enhancing
organizational effectiveness. 

(i.e., 

HR Configurations and Performance

Current literature on HR practices is config-
ured  on  the  basis  of  two  main  approaches:
resource-based  and  control-based  (Bam-
berger  &  Mesoulan,  2000).  In  the  resource-
based  view,  the  value  and  uniqueness  of
human capital is geared toward the internal
development  of  employee  competencies,  as
opposed  to  the  market-based  acquisition  of
such  competencies  (Wernerfelt,  1984).  The
internal  development  HR  system  is  charac-
terized  by  extensive  training,  promotion
from  within,  developmental  performance
appraisal,  skill-based  pay,  and  job  security,
whereas the market-based HR system is char-
acterized by little formal training, little secu-
rity,  and  market-based  compensation.  The

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

control-based approach focuses on monitor-
ing employee behaviors and employee com-
pliance  with  process-based  standards  (Snell,
1992). It is further divided into two alterna-
tives:  process-oriented  control  or  outcome-
oriented control. Process-oriented control is
characterized as having fixed and
explicit  job  design,  formalized
evaluation through carefully pre-
scribed job requirements, and an
efficiency-based  reward.  In  con-
trast, outcome-oriented control is
characterized by having extensive
long-term  rewards  and  employee
participation  and  involvement
(Dyer & Reeves, 1995). 

Integrating  these  two  ap-
proaches, Lepak and Snell (2002)
proposed 
four  configurations
(i.e., commitment-based, produc-
tivity-based,  compliance-based,
and  collaborative-based).  Draw-
ing  on  Lepak  and  Snell  (1999),
the  distinguishing  characteristics
of each type of configuration are
briefly described as follows.

Commitment-based  HR  sys-
tems  nurture  employee  involve-
ment  and  maximize  the  firm’s
return  on  human  capital  invest-
ments.  Firms  invest  substantially
to  develop  unique  skills  through
extensive training initiatives. Jobs
are  loosely  defined  to  capitalize
on  employee  potential.  Employ-
ees  are  encouraged  to  learn  and
master  firm-specific  competen-
cies. Pay is linked to performance.
These  practices  are  designed  to
elicit commitment from employ-
ees.  The  collective  culture  main-
tains  close  connections  to  each
other  and  encourages  mutual
commitment  toward  each  other.
Empirical  results  from  collective
societies  such  as  Singapore  and  Taiwan,  as
well  as  from  other  Asian  countries  such  as
Korea,  support  high-commitment/-involve-
ment work systems or practices, with a posi-
tive  effect  on  organizational  performance
(Bae  &  Lawler,  2000;  Huang,  2000;  Khatri,

2000). Takeuchi et al. (2003) found support
for  configuring  HRM  strategically  in  China.
Hence, we expect a commitment configura-
tion of HR practice will outperform other HR
configurations in China.

Collaboration-based

HR focuses on

group-based and

egalitarian

practices and is

consistent with the

collective Chinese

cultural value. 

Market-based  HR  systems  emphasize
staffing and deployment of skills for imme-
diate contribution. They rely heavily on the
external labor market for securing the right
people for jobs (Koch & McGrath, 1996). Or-
ganizations are willing to pay market wages
to attract human capital with the necessary
skills and are less likely to invest heavily in
training and development. These
skills  are  easily  acquired  in  the
market.  The  transitional  econ-
omy  is  full  of  rapid  changes,  as
well as uncertainty and volatility.
China is far from being a typical
free-market  economy.  Its  transi-
tion  continues  to  be  planned  by
the state, which has been actively
involved  in  shaping  economic
and business affairs. Market-based
HR  configuration  is  not  effective
because the labor mechanism has
not  been  efficiently  developed
and qualified talent is not readily
available.  Chinese  workers  get
used  to  long-term,  secured  em-
ployment,  rather  than  a  market-
type, contractual relationship. Ge and Ding
(2005) found that market orientation has an
insignificant effect on firm performance.

Compliance-based  HR  activities  focus  on
securing  compliance  with  terms  and  condi-
tions.  Firms  are  more  likely  to  concentrate
on  enforcing  rules  and  regulations,  along
with  attaining  preestablished  standards.
Training,  performance,  and  compensation
are likely to be job-based (Milkovich & New-
man,  2005).  Formalized  rules  and  proce-
dures,  along  with  centralized  power,  seem
the  norm  in  Chinese  firms.  In  the  Chinese
context  of  high  power  distance  and  an  au-
thoritative corporate culture, supervisors are
reluctant  to  share  power  with  subordinates
and unwilling to delegate power during deci-
sion-making processes. They tend to restrict
and  control  subordinates’  behavior  and  use
harsh  rules  and  regulations  to  ensure  com-

pliance.  As  a  result,  Chinese  employees  are
reluctant  to  accept  responsibility  and  un-
likely  to  take  the  initiative  to  get  things
done.  Thus,  compliance-based  HR  is  nega-
tively related to firm performance. However,
under the high-power-distance cultural envi-
ronment, employees tend to accept the con-
centration of power in their supervisors and
get used to being controlled and monitored.
For these reasons, compliance-based HR has
no negative effect on turnover.

Collaborative-based HR systems encourage
and  reward  cooperation,  collaboration,  and
information sharing. Organizations are more
likely  to  focus  on  process  facilitation  and
team  building.  Communication,  team  proj-
ects,  and  job  rotations  are  established  to  fa-
cilitate information sharing and the transfer
of  knowledge.  Group-based  rewards  and  ap-
praisal are used to develop and integrate in-
terdependence 
trust  and  collaboration
(Quinn, Anderson, & Finkelstein, 1996). Col-
laboration-based  HR  focuses  on  group-based
and  egalitarian  practices  and  is  consistent
with  the  collective  Chinese  cultural  value.
The  need  to  develop  cooperation,  informa-
tion  sharing,  and  trust  only  pays  off  in  the
long run. The collective culture emphasizing
harmony, along with less aggressive attitudes
toward  others,  tends  to  favor  less  competi-
tion. Thus, we expect collaborative-based HR
to be moderately related to firm performance. 
The  current  literature  shows  that  HRM
practices,  in  the  form  of  high-involvement
work  practices,  are  associated  with  positive
performance 
(Levering  &
Moskowitz,  1993)  and  higher  financial  suc-
cess  (Lawler,  Mohrman,  &  Ledford,  1995).
Accumulated  research  shows  that  specific
configuration  or  architecture  of  HRM  prac-
tices  allows  a  firm  to  yield  better  perform-
ance (Sheppeck & Militello, 2000). Based on
the  above  discussion,  we  set  up  hypotheses
for  different  HR  configurations  that  lead  to
significant differences in firm performance.

Integrating HR Configuration and
Business Strategy

Competitive strategies have been tested in
China’s business firms, including joint ven-
tures  and  private  enterprises  (Brouthers  &
Xu,  2002;  Ding  &  Akhtar,  2001).  Ge  and
Ding’s  (2005)  study  indicates  that  quality
enhancement  strategy  is  dominant  among
Chinese firms, followed by cost leadership
and innovation strategies. Business strategy
has been used as a contingent factor on HR
configurations and firm performance (Bird
&  Beechler,  1995;  Martell,  Gupta,  &  Car-
roll, 1996). In their empirical study, Schuler
and Jackson (1987) and Sanz-Valle, Sabater-
Sanchez,  and  Aragon-Sanchez 
(1999)
adopted various types of strategies and des-
ignated  different  types  of  HR  activities  in
organizations. 

innovation 

Innovative  strategies  focus  on  offering
something new and different. HR practices
include  selecting  highly  skilled  and  cre-
ative individuals, granting more discretion
to  employees  while  exercising  minimal
control,  and  a  long-term  focus  on  and
greater  commitment  to  development  of
human capital. Organizations adopting an
innovative strategy need to acquire enough
highly skilled new employees from external
sources  to  create  new  knowledge  for  tech-
nological 
(Schuler,  1989).
Therefore, organizations focusing on inno-
vation are most likely to adopt a market HR
system.  Sanz-Valle  et  al.  (1999)  discovered
that  organizations  using  innovative  strat-
egy most frequently utilize temporary con-
tracting.  Furthermore,  Delery  and  Doty
(1996) found partial support that matching
innovative strategy with the market system
resulted in positive organizational perform-
ance.  In  addition,  when  innovation  strat-
egy  is  used,  it  also  needs  to  be  supple-
mented  with  long-term  orientation  and
frequent  and  intense  interaction  among
employees  (Schuler,  1989).  Innovation
strategy is consistent with HR practices that
focus  on  human  capital  development.

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

Companies with an innovative strategy in-
vest more money on training for many rea-
sons. They recognize that they need to de-
velop not only the knowledge and skills of
their  personnel,  but  also  their  employees’
attitudes if they want to encourage creativ-
ity,  flexibility,  and  the  propensity  to  take
risk  and  cooperation  that  this  strategy  re-
quires  if  it  is  to  be  implemented  success-
fully.  High  uncertainty  avoidance  and  less
tolerance for risk taking slow down innova-
tion.  Further,  rules  and  regulations  reduce
individual  initiative.  Thus,  innovation
strategy  is  positively  associated  with  mar-
ket,  commitment,  and  collaboration  sys-
tems  and  negatively  associated  with  com-
pliance systems. The impact of innovation
strategy  will  be  stronger  for  commitment
and collaboration-HR configurations in the
Chinese context. 

Quality-enhancing  strategy  attempts  to

procure  and  deliver  the  highest
quality  of  goods  and  services
possible.  This  strategy  is  domi-
nant  in  Chinese  firms  (Ding  &
Akhtar,  2001).  The  concern  for
quality  is  expected  to  be  re-
flected  in  an  organization’s  ap-
proach  to  HR—for  example,  by
having  active  employee  partici-
pation  in  continuous  improve-
ment  processes  (i.e.,  voluntary
quality  circle;  Barad,  1995).  A
major driving force for this may
be  solely  product  quality  certifi-
cation.  The  appropriate  HRM
philosophy  for  quality-enhanc-
ing strategy is accumulation, which empha-
sizes high levels of involvement and skilled
execution.  It  represents  policies  and  prac-
tices  of  attracting  many  strong  candidates
very  carefully  and  very  consistently,  often
more  on  the  basis  of  personal,  rather  than
technical,  fit.  After  all,  the  technical  skills
that  are  lacking  can  be  gained  through  in-
house  training  programs.  The  organiza-
tion’s commitment to continuous improve-
ment  and  human  capital  development,  in
turn, facilitates the practice of lifetime em-
ployment  systems.  Sanz-Valle  et  al.  (1999)
found  that  organizations  that  adopted  a

692

HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Winter 2008

quality-enhancing strategy invested signifi-
cantly  more  in  training  and  development
and rarely used temporary contracting as a
mode  of  employment.  Therefore,  we  ex-
pected  quality-enhancing  strategy  to  be
positively  associated  with  a  commitment
system, and negatively associated with mar-
ket systems.

The HR practices

for cost-reduction

strategy maximize

efficiency by using

narrowly designed

jobs, close

monitoring, and

minimal levels of

training and

development.

The  cost-reduction  strategy  strives  to
produce goods and services less expensively
than  do  a  firm’s  competitors.  Cost-reduc-
tion  strategy  was  found  to  be  unrelated  to
the  strategic  role  of  HR  functions  (Ding  &
Akhtar,  2001).  The  HR  practices
for cost-reduction strategy maxi-
mize  efficiency  by  using  nar-
rowly designed jobs, close moni-
toring,  and  minimal  levels  of
training and development (Sanz-
Valle et al., 1999; Schuler, 1989).
Cost-minimization firms are less
eager  to  invest  in  their  human
capital. Emphasis is placed on ef-
ficiently  managing  their  work-
force  using  practices  such  as  lit-
tle  employee  involvement  and
reducing their discretionary deci-
sion  making.  Communication  is
mostly  top-down.  Performance
appraisals  focus  on  error  reduc-
tion,  and  training  tends  to  be
used as a remedial activity aimed
at  correcting  skill  deficiencies.
Rewards  are  based  on  fixed
guidelines,  with  little  flexibility.  HR  prac-
tices are simply administrative and reactive.
Preference for centralized, hierarchical, and
formalized  structure  appears  to  favor  cost-
reduction  strategy  in  Chinese  organiza-
tions. Thus, we predict cost-reduction strat-
egy  will  be  positively  associated  with
compliance-based HR. 

The  hypotheses  set  up  to  examine  the
impact the three competitive strategies have
on HR configurations are:

H2a: Cost-reduction strategy is positively associ-

ated with compliance.

H2b:  Quality-enhancing  strategy  is  positively
associated with commitment and negatively
associated with market.

H2c: Innovation strategy is positively associated
with  commitment,  market,  and  collabora-
tion, with a lower magnitude in market. 

Interaction Effects of HR
Configuration and Business Strategy
on Performance

Based  on  the  literature,  an  organization’s
strategy  moderates  the  effect  of  HR  prac-
tices  on  firm  performance  (Hitt,  Bierman,
Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001). Previous stud-
ies  suggested  that  a  bundle  or  set  of  HRM
practices  with  appropriate  business  strate-
gies  were  related  to  reduced  employee
turnover (Arthur, 1994) and higher produc-
tivity (MacDuffie, 1995) and greater finan-
cial  performance  (Huselid,  1995).  Delery
and  Doty  (1996),  as  well  as  Youndt,  Snell,
Dean, and Lepak (1996) found that the in-
teraction  of  business  strategy  and  HRM
practices was an important factor in organ-
ization  effectiveness.  Bjorkman  and  Fan’s
(2002)  study  revealed  that  HR  system  and
strategy  integration  had  a  positive  impact
on  the  performance  of  Chinese  firms.
Based  on  the  view  of  external  fit  of  HRM
systems,  aligning  HR  configuration  with
business  strategy  will  enhance  firm  per-
formance. Therefore, we assert, as discussed
in the previous section, that HR configura-
tions  paired  with  appropriate  business
strategies will have a positive effect on or-
ganization  performance.  To  the  contrary,
the  interaction  of  HR  configurations  with
inappropriate  strategies  will  have  a  nega-
tive impact. There is a total of 12 possible
interactions  altogether.  Due  to  space  limi-
tations, three of the most critical hypothe-
ses are set as follows:

H3a:  The  interaction  of  cost-reduction  strategy
with  compliance  configuration  will  further
enhance organizational performance.

H3b: The interaction of quality-enhancing strat-
egy and commitment configuration will fur-
ther  enhance  organizational  performance,
and  the  interaction  with  market  configura-
tion will reduce organizational performance.
H3c: The interaction of innovation strategy with
commitment,  market,  and  collaboration

configuration will further enhance organiza-
tional performance.

Methods

Sample and Procedures

In this study, the triangulation method (in-
terviews,  survey,  and  documentation)  was
used  to  ensure  accuracy  of  the  data.  Inter-
views  were  conducted  with  HR  experts  and
managers  from  48  firms  in  the  Pearl  River
Delta area of China to identify a broad range
of HR practices in the Chinese context. Based
on the opinion of HR professionals and ex-
perts  from  the  interviews,  together  with  an
extensive review from the current literature,
a list of HR practices was generated and thor-
oughly  discussed  by  a  team  of  HR  re-
searchers. For the present study, a total of 54
HR practices were included, covering the do-
mains of staffing, training and development,
performance appraisal, reward and compen-
sation,  information  sharing  and  participa-
tion in decision making, and job security. Re-
spondents  were  asked  to  mark  the  number
that best indicated the degree to which each
statement  described  HRM  practices  em-
ployed by their organization on a five-point
scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very great extent).
The  questionnaire  was  written  in  Chinese.
These  items  were  pretested  with  practicing
managers to verify the usefulness. 

Questionnaires were e-mailed to the com-
pany’s  HR  department,  and  follow-up  tele-
phone calls were made. A total of 300 ques-
tionnaires  were  distributed,  and  241
responses  were  received.  The  response  rate
was  about  80%.  Respondents  included  mid-
dle  managers  (65.4%),  top  management
(13.5%), and frontline managers (21.1%). Re-
sults  from  one-way  analysis  of  variance
(ANOVA)  revealed  no  significant  differences
in most of the HR, strategy, and performance
measures  except  for  compliance  configura-

demonstrated that responses from the diverse
groups  were  relatively  homogeneous.  The
sample  consisted  of  241  firms  from  Guang-
dong,  China.  The  average  length  that  re-
sponding  firms  have  been  in  operation  was

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

12.3 years, although the length of operation
ranged from 1 to 145 years. In terms of own-
ership, 32.9% were Chinese firms (including
state-owned  and  collectively  owned),  49.6%
were  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan  firms  doing
business  in  China,  and  the  remainder  were
foreign-invested  and  joint  ventures.  Indus-
tries  represented  included  manufacturing
(43.3%),  technology  and  electronic  (38.2%),
and a variety of other service industries, like
financial/insurance  and  wholesaling/retail-
ing.  The  average  number  of  employees  per
firm  was  2,395  but  ranged  from
13 to 91,200. Using a t-test, there
were no significant differences in
HR  configurations  and  business
strategies  between  firms  with
fewer  than  100  employees  and
larger  firms  with  more  than  100
employees.  The  ratio  of  manage-
rial  to  operating  staff  was  9.5%.
On  average,  the  HR  department
had  9.2  persons  and  an  average
annual turnover rate of 11.86%.

The  survey  included  a  broad
range  of  HR  practices,  such  as
staffing,  training  and  develop-
ment,  performance  appraisal,
compensation,  job  design,  inter-
national  promotion,  security,  in-

configurations.  The  results  of  the  factor
structure  based  on  a  theory-driven  configu-
ration of HR practices can be found in Table
I. The resulting HR configuration is very sim-
ilar to Lepak and Snell’s commitment, mar-
ket, collaboration, and compliance. In 2002,
Lepak  and  Snell  proposed  a  productivity
configuration  instead  of  market  configura-
tion. Given that China is the world’s factory,
productivity  configuration  seems  to  be  cru-
cial.  However,  because  the  overall  guiding
principle for economic reform is market ori-
entation,  it  will  be  appropriate  to  use  mar-
ket-based  configuration.  Lepak  and  Snell

(1999,  2002)  did  not  include  items  on  em-
ployee  development,  participation,  and
communication  in  their  study.  But  if  em-
ployees are required to follow strict rules and
procedures,  in  some  sense  it  will  likely  re-
strict  employee  development,  participation,
and  communication.  Thus,  the  reverse-
coded  items  can  be  interpreted  as  compli-
ance.  Following  the  recommendation  by
MacDuffie  (1995)  and  others  (Koch  &  Mc-
Grath, 1996; Youndt et al, 1996), each con-
figuration was operationalized as an additive
index of HR practices (Lepak & Snell, 2002).
Four  HR  indices  were  calculated  by  taking
the mean value of the items in each configu-
ration. The alpha reliability of the measure-
ment scales ranged from 0.76 to 0.86.

Business Strategies

The  types  of  strategies  included  cost  reduc-
tion, innovation, and quality enhancement.
Following  Schuler  and  Jackson  (1987)  and
Huang  (2001),  we  adopted  ten  items  in  the

present  study.  Previous  studies  have  vali-
dated the use of business strategies in a tran-
sitional economy (Brouthers & Xu, 2002; Ge
&  Ding,  2005).  Respondents  were  asked  to
rate each item as it relates to their company’s
strategies on a five-point scale ranging from
1  (strongly  disagree)  to  5  (strongly  agree).
These  items  were  factor  analyzed  using  a
principal  factor  with  varimax  rotation
method.  The  factor  structure  of  business
strategy is given in Table II. All three factors
accounted  for  59.35%  of  the  total  variance
explained.  The  alpha  coefficients  for  cost,
quality,  and  innovation  were  .68,  .78,  and
.71, respectively.

Performance Measures

The  present  study  uses  multiple  firm  per-
formance measures (i.e., employee turnover,
financial  profit,  and  sales  growth).  Because
not all of the organizations we surveyed are
publicly listed, objective financial data were
not available for all. Furthermore, even avail-

able  and  objective  financial  figures  turned
out to not be directly comparable in a study
like this, which covers a wide variety of types
of organizations. Managers are likely to pro-
vide  the  best  estimate  of  firm  performance.
The dependent variables in the present study
include four performance indicators: overall
performance,  turnover  rate,  sales  growth
rate, and profit growth rate. Sales growth and
profit growth reflect the conventional meas-
ure  of  profitability  and  market  share.  Sales
growth  rate  and  profit  growth  rate  were
measured by the percentage change in sales
and  profit  over  the  prior  two
years.  Overall  performance  is  a
composite  measure  of  productiv-
ity,  the  quality  of  products  and
services,  research  and  develop-
ment  capability,  and  market
shares.  These  items  were  meas-
ured  on  a  five-point  Likert  scale
ranging  from  1  (very  low)  to  5
(very  high).  Factor  analysis  re-
sulted  in  one  single  factor  ac-
counted  for  54.68%  of  the  vari-
ance explained.

Control Variables

HR practices. 

Because  firms  with  superior  re-
sources  would  be  more  likely  to
be  able  to  formulate  and  imple-
ment unique and innovative strategies, firm
size  and  ownership  types  are  controlled  for
when  predicting  organizational  perform-
ance. Firm size was measured by the number
of full-time employees. We used natural log-
arithmic  transformation  to  normalize  the
distributions  and  made  the  measure  more
consistent  with  existing  literature.  A  firm’s
ownership structure also can influence HRM
and performance. State-owned firms tend to
be  more  embedded  in  institutional  con-
straints and therefore tend to be less flexible
in  adopting  innovative  HR  practices.  In
terms of ownership structure, we used firms
in Hong Kong and Taiwan firms as a base for
comparison.  Three  dummy  variables  were
created  to  represent  state-owned,  collective,
and  foreign-invested/joint  ventures.  Results
from χ2 =36.57, df = 3, p < .01, indicate a sig-

nificant difference in ownership distribution
in  comparison  with  Guangdong  province.
Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan  firms  are  slightly
overrepresented  in  the  sample.  Hong  Kong
and Taiwan firms play a leading role in trans-
forming  enterprise  management  in  South
China. The industry is another variable to be
controlled. The service industry was used as
a  basis  for  comparison.  Two  dummy  vari-
ables were created to represent the manufac-
turing  and  technology  industry  (microcom-
puters, 
telecommunication  and  other
electronic facilities). Since ownership and in-
dustry are control variables, statistical proce-
dure rules out serious bias of the results.

Regression analysis was used to assess the
relative impact of all the variables and the ex-
tent  to  which  the  four  HR  configurations  af-
fect  performance  through  the  interaction  of
three business strategies. A potential problem
of common method variance can result from
collecting all variables from the same respon-
dent, in the same survey. Following Podsakoff,
MacKenzie,  and  Lee  (2003),  we  checked  for
presence of common method bias by conduct-
ing  Harman’s  one-factor  test  in  our  data.  A
principal components factor analysis with an
unrotated  solution  yielded  ten  factors  with
eigenvalues  greater  than  1,  accounting  for
63.87% of the total variance. The largest vari-
ance  explained  by  factor  1  is  34.60%,  which
suggests that no single factor accounted for a
majority  of  the  covariance  in  the  variables.
The result shows that common method vari-
ance is unlikely to be a serious problem. 

Results

The  descriptive  statistics  and  correlations
among variables are given in Table III. It is ob-
served that significant positive correlation ex-
ists among the three business strategies. The
four  HR  configurations  are  also  significantly
correlated  with  each  other.  The  overall  out-
come is positively correlated with innovation,
commitment, market, and collaboration, but
negatively correlated with compliance. These
correlation results confirmed the findings re-
ported in previous research (Bird & Beechler,
1995;  Huang,  2001;  Takeuchi,  Wakebayashi,
& Chen, 2003). Surprisingly, sales growth rate

is  negatively  correlated  with  quality  and  in-
novation. Profit growth rate shows no signifi-
cant  correlation  with  any  of  the  variables.
State-owned  firms  show  lower  performance
and staff turnover rate as reflected by signifi-
cant  negative  correlation  with  overall  out-
come and turnover. As predicted, both overall
outcome and turnover had a significant effect
on  all  four  HR  configurations.  In  contrast,
sales  and  profit  showed  no  significant  effect
on all four HR configurations.

For  business  strategy,  cost  reduction  has
no significant effect on all four performance
measures.  Quality  enhancement  strategy
shows  a  significant  negative  effect  on  sales,
profit, and turnover rate. Innovation strategy
is positively correlated with overall outcome
but negatively correlated with sales growth.

Table IV displaces the results of regression
analysis testing the effects of HR configuration

on performance. Firm size, ownership, and in-
dustry  were  entered  as  control.  State-owned
firms  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on
overall  performance  and  the  rate  of  staff
turnover.  Obviously,  state-owned  enterprises
(SOEs) are less efficient. Workers in SOEs enjoy
high  job  security  and  tend  to  have  lower
turnover. Technology firms are more efficient.
The  check  for  Variance  Inflation  Factor  (VIF)
shows  no  problem  of  multicollinearity.  HR
configurations have a significant effect in pre-
dicting  overall  outcome  and  turnover,  as
shown in the significant ∆R2 and F values, but
no significant effect on sales and profit growth
rates.  Perhaps  financial  measures  may  be  af-
fected by many other factors in a transitional
economy.  In  predicting  the  overall  outcome,
compliance has a marginally significant nega-
tive  effect  (β  =  –.18,  p <  .10),  while  commit-
ment has a significant positive effect (β = .21,

p < .05). Such results are consistent with cur-
rent literature stating that a commitment HR
system  invests  in  human  capital  in  a  move
that, in turn, improves firm performance.

A compliance HR system has a significant
negative effect on profit growth and a signifi-
cant positive effect on the turnover rate. The
compliance-based HR system does not lead to
better performance even in a traditional high-
power-distance and hierarchical Chinese soci-
ety. A market-based HR system shows no sig-
nificant  effect  on  all  performance  measures.
The results are consistent with our predictions
in Hypotheses 1a–c. Market-oriented and col-
laboration-based HR produced no significant
effect,  particularly  for  SOEs.  Inherited  from
the historical burden of the planned socialist
economy, SOEs are less market-oriented. 

The  impact  of  the  three  business  strate-
gies  on  HR  configurations  can  be  found  in
Table V. When the control variables were first
entered  into  the  regression,  collectively
owned firms showed a significant negative ef-

fect  on  commitment  but  a  significant  posi-
tive  impact  on  compliance.  Collectively
owned firms with fewer resources tend to rely
on  control  rather  than  investing  in  high-
commitment  HR  practices.  In  testing  the
main effect, the three business strategies have
a significant effect on the four HR configura-
tions, as indicated by the significant ∆R2 and
F values. Again, a VIF test for multicollinear-
ity shows no problem. As for different busi-
ness strategies, we observed a highly signifi-
cant  effect  on  four  HR  configurations.  Cost
reduction had a significant negative effect on
compliance (β = –.24, p < .05) but a significant
positive effect on collaboration (β = .30, p <
.01). Contrary to our expectation, Hypothesis
2a is not supported. Quality-enhancing strat-
egy  significantly  affected  commitment  only
(β = .23, p < .05). Though quality-enhancing
strategy is negatively associated with market
configuration  but  not  significant  (β  =  –.09).
Hypothesis 2b is partially supported. Innova-
tion strategy has a significant positive impact

on commitment (β = .44, p < .01), market (β =
.30, p < .05), and collaboration (β = .57, p <
.01)  but  a  significant  negative  impact  on
compliance (β = –.50, p < .01). Hypothesis 2c
is confirmed. Compliance HR practice is not
conducive to innovation strategy. 

Results of regression analyses testing the
interaction effect are depicted in Table VI. As
recommended by Aiken and West (1996), the
mean-centered  variables  were  used  for  the
main and interaction terms in the regression
analysis.  We  conducted  separate  regression
analyses on all four dependent variables and
tested  all  the  possible  interaction  terms  in
our analysis. We observed significant interac-

tion  effects  on  overall  outcome,  and  sales
and  profit  growth  rates,  but  no  significant
interaction  effect  on  turnover  rate.  There-
fore, the results of the turnover rate are not
included in Table VI. 

For  the  main  effect,  HR  configurations
show  no  significant  impact  on  the  three
performance measures, except the marginal
significant  effect  collaborative  HR  systems
have on overall outcome. Both quality-en-
hancing and innovation strategy are nega-
tively  related  to  sales  growth  and  profit
growth.  Cost-reduction  strategy  does  not
have  any  significance  on  three  perform-
ance measures.

Strategic HRM in China: Configurations and Competitive Advantage

701

The  interaction  of  cost  X  commitment
shows a significant negative effect on overall
outcome  and  profit  growth.  Hypothesis  3a,
therefore, is not supported. Even though not
hypothesizing  in  our  interaction  terms,  the
interaction  of  cost  X  commitment  showed
significant  negative  effect  on  both  overall
outcome (β = –.52, p < .10) and profit growth
(β = –1.97, p < .01). There was no significant
effect  for  the  interaction  of  cost  and  other
HR configurations. The interaction effects of
quality X commitment had a marginally sig-
nificant positive effect on overall outcome (β
=  .35,  p <  .10),  sales  (β  =  .70,  p <  .05),  and
profit  growth  (β  =  .88,  p <  .05).  Quality  X
market were negatively associated with over-
all  outcome  (β  =  –.53,  p <  .05)  and  profit
growth (β = –1.09, p < .05). These results sup-
port  Hypothesis  3b.  Innovation  X  commit-
ment has a significant positive effect on both
sales (β = 1.12, p < .05) and profit growth (β
= 1.47, p < .05). Contrary to our prediction,
innovation has no significant interaction ef-
fect with other HR configurations. These re-
sults only provide partial support to Hypoth-
esis  3c.  It  should  be  noted  that  HR
configurations have no significant effect on
sales  growth  and  profit  growth,  but  the  in-
teraction of HR configurations and business
strategy  shows  a  significant  effect  on  profit
and sales growth, as indicated by highly sig-
nificant F values. 

Figures 1 to 4 display the pattern of sig-
nificant interaction terms (due to space lim-
itation, not all significant interaction charts
are  shown  here).  When  a  commitment  HR

configuration  was  matched  with  low-cost
strategy, it had a positive impact on overall
outcome,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  High-cost
strategy  is  not  likely  to  benefit  with  overall
outcome  as  indicated  by  the  steep  negative
slope  with  overall  outcome.  In  contrast,  a
commitment  HR  configuration  matching
with  a  high-quality  strategy  will  lead  to  a
slight increase in profit growth, while using
a  low-quality  strategy  leads  to  substantial
negative profit growth for high-commitment
HR, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 indicates
that  high-quality  strategy  is  detrimental  to
profit  growth  for  organizations  pursuing
high market-based HR. Graphically, Figure 4
shows  that  for  organizations  with  the  com-
mitment HR configuration, pursuing a high-
innovation strategy does not make much dif-
ference,  while  adopting  low-innovation
strategy  will  result  in  dramatically  lower
sales growth. 

Discussion and Conclusions

The present study seeks to identify the pat-
tern  of  HRM  configurations  that  would  im-
prove  the  performance  of  China’s  business
firms.  Results  from  the  present  study  par-
tially  support  the  configuration  hypothesis
as a way to predict firm performance. Based
on a theoretically driven measure, we assess
the relative efficiency of various HR practice
configurations.  Commitment  HR  showed  a
positive  significant  effect  on  overall  out-
come. Compliance showed a negative signif-
icant  effect  on  overall  outcome,  a  marginal

positive  effect  on  turnover,  and  a  marginal
negative  effect  on  profit  growth.  For  these
reasons,  it  appears  obvious  that  organiza-
tions  should  move  away  from  controlling
employees and seek instead to gain commit-
ment from their workers. Compliance in the
high-power-distance  culture  is  not  well  re-
ceived, at least not at the current stage of the
diffusion process. Economic reforms have ac-
tually  undermined  participative  manage-
ment. For this reason, we believe further re-
search in this area is needed. 

The  findings  in  this  study  of  Chinese
business firms indicate that a commitment
HR configuration, compared with other HR
configurations,  has  a  significantly  positive
effect.  Results  from  the  present  study  are
consistent  with  those  from  the  Western
countries 
(Arthur,  1994;  Delaney  &
Huselid,  1996),  Asian  countries  (Bae  &
Lawler, 2000; Guthrie, 2001), and even the
Chinese  culture  societies  (Huang,  2000;
Khatri, 2000). The results also confirm that
a  commitment  HR  system  is  an  effective
way to create a competitive advantage and
enhance  organizational  performance  in
emerging economies such as China (Bjork-
man  &  Fan,  2002).  This  finding  offers  re-
search-guided  practical  implications  for
Chinese  firms  as  it  relates  to  upgrading
their  HRM  system.  In  terms  of  business
strategy, low cost is the dominant strategy
used  in  Chinese  firms.  Results  from  the
present study confirm findings from previ-
ous studies, which showed that low cost is
not a very good strategy for Chinese firms
(Brouthers & Xu, 2002). A narrow emphasis
on  cost  control  may  prevent  firms  from

spending  on  new  product  development,
technological  improvement,  and  quality
control, which in turn may affect firm per-
formance.  While  organizations  often  seek
cost  advantages,  they  should  also  empha-
size  quality.  Innovation  is  a  risky  strategy
for organizations that are not emphasizing
commitment HR practices.

While  there  is  little  support  showing
that HR configurations are significantly as-
sociated with the growth of sales and prof-
its, HR configurations combined with busi-
ness  strategy  create  significant  interaction
effects  on  sales  and  profit  growth.  The  in-
teraction  of  particular  HR  configurations
with  business  strategy  has  synergistic  ef-
fects on performance. Results show signifi-
cant  gains  if  HR  configuration  is  aligned
with business strategy. Thus, if you want to
yield  maximum  results,  it  is  important  to
align HR configuration to a firm’s business
strategy.

In  the  present  study,  the  performance
measures  include  overall  outcome  (a  com-
posite measure), turnover (behavioral conse-
quence),  financial  outcome  (profit  growth
rate),  and  market  outcome  (sales  growth
rate).  HR  configurations  are  most  likely  to
have  a  significant  impact  on  HR  outcomes,
followed  by  organizational,  financial,  and
market  outcomes  (Dyer  &  Reeves,  1995).
This is because HR strategies are primarily de-
signed  to  impact  HR  outcomes.  Turnover  is
affected in part by labor market conditions.
Financial  and  market  outcomes  are  influ-
enced  by  other  factors,  such  as  economic
condition (Rogers & Wright, 1998). The im-
pact on financial performance is minimal in

the  present  study.  Apparently,  the  current
HR  practices  seem  to  have  less  effect  on  a
firm’s  financial  performance,  at  least  in  the
present  study  in  Guangdong,  China.  One
reason  may  be  because  financial  perform-
ance  is  influenced  by  other  economic  fac-
tors, such as macroeconomic conditions and
the  government’s  intervening  policy.  An-
other  possible  explanation  is  that  because
HR is regarded as an asset and source of sus-
tainable  competitive  advantage,  the  out-
comes generated by HRM may not necessar-
ily be assessed using short-term performance
measures (Pfeffer, 1994).

Limitations and Future Research
Directions

Caution is needed when interpreting results
in the configuration of HR practices. Organi-
zations  use  a  wide  range  of  HRM  practices,
and the lack of consensus in the configura-
tion  of  HR  practices  has  led  to  inconsisten-
cies in research linking HR practices to firm
performance.  Attention  should  be  paid  to
the adequacy of variables selected to identify
configurations.  Another  possible  explana-
tion  for  the  inconsistencies  lies  in  the  way
these  HR  configurations  were  implemented
in  the  chosen  sample.  It  is  very  likely  that
senior  management  recognizes  the  impor-
tance of human resource policies and ignores
the  implementation  of  these  HR  practices.
Future research is needed to fill this gap by
assessing  the  level  of  implementation  of
HRM in organizations.

There  is  a  lack  of  statistical  evidence  of
HR  configuration  in  relation  to  financial
performance.  One  possible  explanation  for
this  may  be  related  to  the  use  of  self-re-
ported, subjective measurements. Profit rate
is commonly accepted as a reliable proxy for
assessing  financial  performance  (Kimbara,
1991).  Chinese  respondents  are  often  very
sensitive  about  publicizing  financial  per-
formance  figures.  Therefore,  rating  of  the
profit  rate  and  a  subjective  evaluation  of
corporate performance were employed as in-
dicators of corporate financial performance.
Subjective  measures  of  firm  performance
were  widely  used  in  the  literature  (Bae  &

Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm

Lawler,  2000;  Delaney  &  Huselid,  1996;
Harel & Tzafrir, 1999). In the absence of ob-
jective  data,  self-reported  measures  are  an
acceptable  substitute  and  are  equally  reli-
able. Prior research by Dollinger and Golden
(1992) showed that organizational perform-
ance  rated  by  self-reported  measures  was
positively correlated with objective perform-
ance indicators.

Another limitation is the cross-sectional
nature of the study. Causality is difficult to
establish. The advantage of having a broad
range  of  organizations  is  that  it
maximizes variation in the inde-
pendent  variables  and  increases
the  generalizability  of  the  find-
ings. Given the dynamic HR con-
figurations and the sustainability
of 
advantage
changes  over  time,  it  requires  a
longitudinal analysis. 

competitive 

To conclude, the results from
the present study offer some sup-
port that integrating HR configu-
ration  with  business  strategy
enhances organizational perform-
ance,  particularly  for  high-com-
mitment-based HR. The adoption
of  HR  practices  characterized  by
internal  fit  and  external  fit  will
promote performance. It provides
a foundation to study the impor-
tant  HR  strategies  and  organiza-
tional  outcomes  in  a  Chinese
context.  China’s  status  as  one  of
the most attractive business mar-
kets  for  foreign  investors  and  the  second
largest foreign direct investment recipient in
the  world  means  that  its  emergence  in  the
global  economy  offers  great  opportunities.
For multinational corporations operating in
China,  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  is  the
management of human resources. The find-
ings from this present study offer important
insights  for  executives  in  formulating  effec-
tive HRM strategies. Managers should take a
more  proactive  role  in  effectively  imple-
menting  innovative  HR  practices  that  will
help them to achieve higher levels of finan-
cial  performance  and  ultimately  affect  the
bottom line.
