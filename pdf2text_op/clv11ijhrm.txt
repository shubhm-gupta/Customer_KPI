Literature on Intellectual Capital provides interesting arguments about the key role of
social and human capital, not only separately but also jointly, for innovation activities.
Thus, given the acknowledged importance of these variables, this article studies (1)
the direct relationship between social and human capital and innovative performance,
(2) the links between these two components of intellectual capital, as well as the
possible mediating role of human capital, (3) the effect of particular human resource
management
(HRM) practices (selection procedures, development programmes,
empowerment and use of incentives on compensation) on social and human capital,
and (4) the inﬂuence of innovative performance on ﬁrm performance. In our study, we
deﬁne a population of ﬁrms in the most innovative Spanish sectors for an empirical test
of this model, focusing on their R&D departments. Using data taken from 85 ﬁrms and
applying Structural Equation Models, we have tested the hypotheses and obtained
interesting results. It is the uniqueness of human capital, and not its value, which has a
direct and positive effect on ﬁrm innovativeness. Such uniqueness, in turn, is enhanced
through social capital and HRM practices such as empowerment and employee selection
based on learning potential and interpersonal abilities. Social capital does not have, per
se, a direct inﬂuence on innovation, but it indirectly does through human capital. Social
capital, in turn, can be enhanced by the selection of individuals with learning potential
and interpersonal skills, as well as by their involvement in decision-making processes.
Finally, innovation improves ﬁrm performance.

for innovation has attracted researchers interested in determining its elements and the

that has emerged from this framework concerns the potential for interaction between them,
and how such interactions may improve innovative performance. In this sense, the
intellectual capital approach considers that human capital could be leveraged by other
dimensions of intellectual capital to create new knowledge (McFadyen and Cannella 2004;
Subramaniam and Youndt 2005; Reed, Lubatkin and Srinivasan 2006). Indeed, although
human capital may be the origin of all knowledge, learning requires that individuals
exchange and share insights, knowledge and mental models, which represent social capital
(Senge 1990). Given that innovation is essentially an exercise in collaboration, social
capital plays a key role both directly improving human capital and stressing its effects on
innovation. Therefore, improving individual knowledge and creating the conditions for
sharing it are issues that deserve attention. Nevertheless, although these relationships
among different elements of intellectual capital are worth analysing, little is known about
the empirical effects of social capital on human capital or about the effects of these
relationships on innovativeness.

Given the recognized importance of human and social capital for innovation, an
interesting question emerges: how can organizations ensure high levels of these two
components of intellectual capital? Research has highlighted the role of human resource
management (HRM) as a means of managing human and social capital. Youndt,
Subramaniam and Snell (2004) demonstrate that HRM investment has a signiﬁcant role to
play in creating human and social capital. Nevertheless, they do not consider separately
the effects of speciﬁc HRM practices. Subramaniam and Youndt (2005) conclude that an
organization’s efforts in hiring, training, designing work and implementing other HRM
practices may need to focus not only on maintaining their employees’ functional or
speciﬁc technical skills and expertise but also on developing their abilities to network, to
collaborate and to share information and knowledge. As a consequence, in our research,
we propose that both human and social capital could be enhanced through implementing
HRM practices that promote both the competence of individual employees and their
willingness to interact and to share knowledge.

Therefore, as our main objective, we want to contribute to the literature by analysing
these aspects of intellectual capital (social and human capital) in connection with
innovation, and the role played by particular HRM practices in this area. Speciﬁcally, we
study: (1) the direct relationship between social and human capital and innovative
performance, (2) the links between these two components of intellectual capital, as well as
the possible mediating role of human capital, (3) the effect of particular HRM practices
on social and human capital and (4) the inﬂuence of innovative performance on ﬁrm
performance.

Besides the study of these relationships, this research aims to overcome the problem of
using aggregated measures of human and social capital at the organizational level, which
has been criticized by some authors. In this sense, Downs and Mohr (1976) criticized
researchers for analysing organizational variables as if they are features that characterize
the whole organization, because they may be heterogeneous. Subramaniam and Youndt
(2005) identiﬁed this practice as a limitation to this type of research because it is difﬁcult
to obtain an aggregate measure of intellectual capital. This explains why we undertake a
department-level analysis by focusing our study on R&D departments. Although it is clear
that knowledge could be generated by the organization as a whole, it is arguably the
case that the inﬂuence of human and social capital on innovation is especially relevant in
these R&D departments, given their major contribution to innovation.

Our study contributes to the existing literature on innovation and HRM. First, by
discussing the inﬂuence exerted by social capital on human capital, we can reach a better

understanding of their direct and combined effects on innovation. Second, by testing
empirically that both human and social capital can be enhanced through speciﬁc HRM
practices, we contribute to the HRM literature. Third, we suggest that our focus on
R&D departments leads to a better understanding of the speciﬁc variables (employees’
knowledge, relations and practices) that affect ﬁrms’ innovation.

Below, we ﬁrst explain the theoretical arguments used to establish the hypotheses
tested in this study, based on the insights provided by the intellectual capital, HRM and
innovation approaches. Then, we empirically test our hypotheses based on a sample of
Spanish industrial companies. Finally, we discuss our ﬁndings and draw conclusions from
this study.

Theoretical review

Human capital and innovative performance

Innovation has become fundamental for achieving competitive advantage (Van de Ven
1986; Brown and Eisenhardt 1995; Van de Ven and Poole 1995; Hamel 1998; Darroch and
McNaughton 2002; Martinez-Ros and Salas-Fuma´s 2004; Zhou 2006) and is currently one
of the principal topics of debate in the management literature (Sørensen and Stuart 2000).
Although organizational factors that may facilitate such innovations include technologies,
managerial support, speciﬁc ﬁrm design and the like, the existing literature emphasizes the
role of individual knowledge working in an organization (human capital) as the primary
resource for innovation (Boxall 1996; Teece, Pisano and Shuen 1997; Barney and Wright
1998; Argote and Ingram 2000; Alegre, Lapiedra and Chiva 2006).

The human capital of an organization is deﬁned as the knowledge, skills and abilities
(KSA) residing with and utilized by individuals (Subramaniam and Youndt 2005, p. 451).
Given the close connection between the knowledge possessed by the personnel of the ﬁrm
and its products and services, it is clear that a ﬁrm’s ability to produce new products and
other organizational capabilities is inextricably linked to its human capital (Laursen 2002;
Lopez-Cabrales, Valle and Herrero 2006). Considering the human capital approach, the
value and uniqueness of knowledge are the most relevant features for innovation (Lepak
and Snell 1999; Subramaniam and Youndt 2005).

Value refers to the potential to improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the ﬁrm,
exploit market opportunities and/or neutralize potential threats (Lepak and Snell 2002,
p. 519). As Barney and Wright (1998) suggested, resources may create value either by
decreasing product or services costs or by differentiating products or services in a way
that allows the ﬁrm to charge a premium price. Valuable knowledge yields high returns in
markets which increase the ratio of beneﬁts to customers relative to their associated costs
(Wernerfelt 1984; Snell, Lepak and Youndt 1999; Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall
2003). Regarding innovation, employees with valuable knowledge and skills are positively
associated with innovative capacity, because they contribute to the identiﬁcation of
new market opportunities, and employees with such knowledge are willing to experiment
and apply new procedures (Costa and McCrae 1992; Taggar 2002). As Subramaniam and
Youndt (2005) pointed out, it is among these individuals that organizations ﬁnd the
greatest collection and diversity of skills. These employees are also the most ﬂexible in
acquiring new skills, which enhance the ﬁrm’s innovative performance.

The second feature of human capital is its uniqueness. Uniqueness makes an employee
irreplaceable and idiosyncratic, and his or her rare and ﬁrm-speciﬁc KSA (Barney 1991)
may be difﬁcult to transfer to other positions and for other ﬁrms to duplicate (Lepak and
Snell 1999; Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall 2003). This unique human capital may

generate competitive differentiation because valuable but common (i.e. not rare) resources
and capabilities are sources of competitive parity (Barney 1995; Snell et al. 1999). In
addition, people with unique KSA are considered ‘rainmakers’, and their specialized
knowledge contributes to the development of new ideas and products (James 2002). By
contrast, generic knowledge is rarely the source of innovative activity because it is widely
available in the market (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). Amar (2002) suggests that
employees possessing rare KSA are not commonly observed in the labour market.
Therefore, their knowledge is also new to competing ﬁrms and thus it constitutes an
intangible resource for ﬁrm innovation. On the basis of the above arguments, we propose
our ﬁrst hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1:
Hypothesis 1a: Valuable human capital

is positively associated with innovative

performance.

Hypothesis 1b: Unique human capital

is positively associated with innovative

performance.

Social capital: inﬂuences on innovative performance and human capital

Social capital is the second aspect of intellectual capital that we study. It has been
conceptualized as the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within,
available through and derived from the networks of relationships possessed by an
individual or social unit (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998). Spender (1996) uses the term
‘collective knowledge’, which is tacit and situated in a social dimension. Because of this, it
is the most difﬁcult aspect of intellectual capital to manage and measure. This may also
explain why it is the most strategic type of knowledge (Spender 1996). On the basis of the
work of Granovetter (1992), several researchers have highlighted two main aspects of
social capital: structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness.

Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) deﬁne structural embeddedness as the personal
conﬁguration of linkages between people or units, which includes the pattern of relationships
among economic actors (with whom and how these relationships take place) and the existence
of network ties and network conﬁguration in terms of density, connectivity and hierarchy,
besides other aspects. Relational embeddedness relates to the type of relationships that people
develop among themselves over time. Relational embeddedness emphasizes the aspects of
relationships that inﬂuence people’s behaviour, such as friendship, trust and respect.

Structural embeddedness and relational embeddedness have different effects on
performance; although the former relates to the structure of networks (determining with
whom each person maintains contact),
the latter focuses on the quality of these
relationships (Moran 2005). In this sense, the higher the degree of proximity or familiarity
of the relationships, the greater the transfer of resources, tacit knowledge and complex
knowledge. In these circumstances, managers are more willing to support and motivate
innovative activities by providing the necessary backing to entrepreneurs to transform
their ideas into successful projects. Moran’s (2005) results suggest that the relational
dimension inﬂuences innovation tasks more than does the structural dimension. Thus, our
research focuses on the relational aspect of social capital.

Other researchers have highlighted the importance of the relational side of social
capital for innovation. Tsai and Ghoshal (1998) demonstrate that this relational dimension
positively inﬂuences resource exchange and the coordination among the people involved,
which, at the same time, creates value for the ﬁrm through its effect on product innovation.
Moreover, Lee, Wong and Chong (2005) state that the relational dimension, characterized


The International Journal of Human Resource Management

by high levels of trust and friendship, makes people more willing to engage in social
exchange and cooperative interaction, which involves, e.g. relying on others, asking for
help, having spontaneous conversations and unplanned meetings, and sharing information,
knowledge and resources. Given that social capital theory emphasizes friendship and trust
for the relational dimension, the quality of communication is an important determinant
(Watson and Papamarcos 2002). In this sense, research in this ﬁeld has highlighted the role
of communication and information gathering for organizational innovation (Monge,
Cozzens and Contractor 1992). Subramaniam and Youndt (2005) argue that innovation is
essentially a collaborative effort and that, thus, communication, the ﬂuid diffusion
of information, and the sharing and assimilating of knowledge are vital elements of
innovative capabilities. Similarly, Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) argue that the relational
dimension of social capital may represent an increased willingness to experiment with
combining different types of information as well as to develop new knowledge. Thus, we
can state our second hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2:

The relational side of social capital

is positively associated with

However, we assume that social capital not only has a direct effect on innovation but
also affects innovation through its effect on human capital. Given that both social capital
and human capital are aspects of intellectual capital, which is the basis of innovation, we
consider potential interaction between them. This idea is supported by the research on
innovation, which suggests that the development of new products and services results not
from individual effort (at the individual level of knowledge) but from creative cooperation
(at the social level) (Leonard and Sensiper 1998). Consequently, social capital and human
capital are not

independent variables; rather,

they interact

We argue that high levels of social capital can enhance the skills and capabilities of
individuals (human capital). Adler and Kwon (2002) highlight information as being the
ﬁrst direct beneﬁt of social capital. They argued that social capital facilitates access
to broader sources of information and improves information’s quality, relevance and
timeliness. These conditions allow individuals to enhance their knowledge through
everyday interactions with colleagues. Similarly, Reed et al. (2006) state that
the
inimitable value of human capital can be enhanced by social relations. Their argument is
that, given competent and credible participants from a diverse set of disciplines, a network
of rich social connections (the relational side of social capital) can reduce the amount of
time and investment required to gather information and can serve as a valuable conduit for
knowledge diffusion and transfer (Burt 1997; Coleman 1998; Reed et al. 2006). McFadyen
and Cannella (2004) demonstrate that the strength of a relationship (in terms of the
relational side of social capital) can positively affect knowledge creation at the individual
level. In summary, individuals’ KSA can be more valuable and unique by means of
interaction with other colleagues (Loury 1987; Schiff 1992; Putnam 1993; Coleman 1998;
Adner and Helfat 2003; Reed et al. 2006). Thus, we state our third hypothesis.

Hypothesis 3:

The relational side of social capital has a positive effect on human
capital.

Hypothesis 3a: The relational side of social capital has a positive effect on valuable

human capital.

Hypothesis 3b: The relational side of social capital has a positive effect on unique

human capital.

HRM practices, human capital and social capital

We have justiﬁed the importance of human and social capital for obtaining innovative
performance, as well as the potential for social capital to enhance human capital. In this
section, we discuss how to enhance both these components of intellectual capital by
implementing particular HRM practices.

The ‘human capital advantage’ described by Boxall (1996) tends to weaken over
time. In other words, knowledge, skills and expertise tend to become obsolete. Moreover,
managers could encourage high-quality relationships (social capital)
to arise
spontaneously and could direct them towards the strategic objectives of ﬁrms.

As argued by Boxall (1996) and Snell, Youndt and Wright (1996), companies can
prevent human capital from becoming obsolete and can stimulate social capital by
implementing particular HRM practices. Employing appropriate personnel management
procedures, human and social capital can be directed to achieving organizational
capabilities by taking into account the value and speciﬁcity of employees’ knowledge. As
a result, this knowledge is updated, improved and disseminated within the organization
(Lepak and Snell 1999; Currie and Kerrin 2003).

Particular HRM practices can be recommended for enhancing social capital and for
maintaining the value and uniqueness of human capital. However, coherence among these
practices is required. Rather than discuss individual and disconnected HRM practices, we
focus on three relevant HRM practices with different orientations: stafﬁng procedures,
personnel development and use of incentives as a form of compensation (Lepak and Snell
1999, 2002; Gomez-Mejı´a, Balkin and Cardy 2007).

Stafﬁng practices must be directed to the creation of both human and social capital. In
the ﬁrst case, the orientation of stafﬁng procedures changes depending on the necessity of
general versus ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital (Sekiguchi 2007). Following Lepak and Snell
(1999, 2002), it is appropriate that new employees be selected based more on their
potential (e.g. their cognitive capacities, aptitudes and motivation) than on their current
knowledge, skills and experience. When such a selection policy is applied, the company is
more likely to incorporate into the organization individuals who are capable of learning
the valuable and unique knowledge that is necessary for the ﬁrm’s competitiveness,
thereby building human capital that will be advantageous to the company (Subramaniam
and Youndt 2005; Sekiguchi 2007). In our case, ﬁrms will search for and incorporate
employees with learning potential in order to develop valuable and unique knowledge that
favours innovation. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 4:

HRM practices, such as selection processes based on employees’
potential to learn, have a positive inﬂuence on the value and uniqueness
of human capital.

The stafﬁng of employees with valuable and unique human capital is not enough.
Companies must incorporate attitudes towards teamwork, interpersonal adaptability and
similar criteria into their selection processes in order to improve their social capital
(Lengnick-Hall and Lengnick-Hall 2003). In their study of knowledge-intensive ﬁrms,
Swart and Kinnie (2003) analyse the HRM practices of a software company that develops
the social capital for enabling interconnections within the knowledge pool of its
employees. Their case study shows how technical ability was not considered the most
important element in the selection of candidates and how it was the company’s culture that
led the recruitment process. Once technically competent candidates were identiﬁed,
recruits needed to show how they would share their innovative ideas and cutting-edge

know-how within a project team. This kind of practice is expected to affect social capital
positively by incorporating into the organization individuals with interpersonal skills and
by promoting interaction among individuals (Lepak and Snell 1999). Given the above
discussion, we propose the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 5:

HRM practices, such as selection processes based on interpersonal skills,
have a positive inﬂuence on social capital.

Developmental practices such as speciﬁc training, career management, mentoring and
giving feedback to employees will improve an organization’s human capital. As human
capital theory has outlined, investment in speciﬁc training not only improves individual
performance but also encourages career development, which must be facilitated by the
ﬁrm (Flamholtz and Lacey 1981). Thus, when employees know that their company has
training programmes to improve their personal competence, the value and uniqueness of
the organization’s human capital are enhanced. This is because employees will tend to
match their knowledge and skills to the needs of the organization (Shipton, Dawson, West
and Patterson 2002). Similarly, when employees are offered career paths within the
company, and receive feedback concerning their performance and how it could be
improved, valuable and ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge is generated through internal
development. As discussed above, career expectations contribute to innovative behaviours
and enhance human capital
these
developmental practices motivate employees to create opportunities and to improve
their personal stocks of knowledge and skills (Ulrich and Lake 1990; Snell and Dean 1994;
Lepak, Liao, Chung and Harden 2006). Thus, we try to conﬁrm the following hypothesis.

(Slagter 2009). Researchers have shown that

Hypothesis 6:

Developmental HRM practices, such as speciﬁc training, career
management, mentoring programmes and feedback appraisals, have a
positive inﬂuence on the value and uniqueness of human capital.

Other personnel development practices, such as the delegation of responsibilities and
the involvement of employees in decision making, should also be given priority. This is
because these practices motivate employees to share their knowledge with colleagues.
Implementing this type of HRM practice improves an organization’s social capital,
thereby strengthening the ﬂow and exchange of information within work groups (Ulrich
1998). Evidence shows that empowerment and employee participation in decision making
enable formal and informal work relations that provide employees with a network that they
can use for sharing information (Adner and Helfat 2003). Therefore, we can state the
following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 7:

Developmental HRM practices, such as empowerment and employees’
participation in decision making, have a positive inﬂuence on social
capital.

The last set of practices, compensation practices, may also contribute to enhancing
human and social capital. Speciﬁcally, two issues are important here: the use of individual
incentives for new ideas and team-based incentives. Compensation systems are considered
especially important when an employer wants employees to acquire the valuable and
unique competences considered necessary to a ﬁrm’s operations (Shaw, Gupta, Mitra
and Ledford 2005). Effective compensation systems work to attract and retain the more
valuable employees, and to motivate them to develop the required competences (Park,
Gardner and Wright 2004). The reasoning is that a company determines the valuable and
unique competences that its human resources should possess and decides on the incentives


814

C. Cabello-Medina et al.

to encourage their acquisition and development (Cappelli and Singh 1992; Wright,
McMahan and McWilliams 1994). Therefore, when employees recognize that they are
assessed and then paid according to their contributions over time, in order to develop more
valuable and unique contributions, they have an incentive to acquire knowledge that is more
valuable to the company and more difﬁcult for competitors to duplicate (Baron and Byrne
1997; Lepak and Snell 1999, 2002). Therefore, we advance the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 8:

HRM practices, such as the use of individual compensation incentives,
have a positive inﬂuence on the value and uniqueness of human capital.

These arguments also apply to teams working on innovations (Sarin and Mahajan
2001). Speciﬁcally, Barczak and Wilemon (2003) demonstrate that members of work
teams have a strong interest in being remunerated according to the results generated
by their teams. Similarly, Laursen (2002) and Laursen and Foss (2003) demonstrate
empirically the positive impact of team-based pay on team performance as a motivating
tool for sharing knowledge. In summary, the use of group-based incentives may enhance
cooperative behaviour and increase interaction among individuals because they perceive
that part of their compensation depending on group results (Ulrich and Lake 1990; Snell
and Dean 1994; Lepak and Snell 2002). Our next hypothesis is as follows.

Hypothesis 9:

HRM practices such as the use of team-based incentives in compensation
have a positive inﬂuence on the ﬁrm’s social capital.

The contribution of innovation to ﬁrm performance

The ﬁnal stage of our investigation seeks to learn whether those ﬁrms with the appropriate
human capital, social capital and HRM practices obtain not only innovations but also a higher
performance in the market. According to the literature, innovation is one of the main sources
of competitive advantage (Li and Atuahene-Gima 2001). If a company develops innovations
based on valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources, such as valuable and
unique knowledge, they will lead to higher levels of competitive advantage (Barney 1991).
Firms that offer new products, adapted to the needs and wants of target customers, are in a
better position to obtain higher performance and create sustainable competitive advantage
(Prahalad and Hamel 1990; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995; Alegre et al. 2006).

It has been proposed that the development of an innovation contributes to the
performance of a company (Damanpour 1991; Capon, Farley, Lehmann and Hulbert 1992;
Pe´rez-Lun˜o, Valle Cabrera and Wiklund 2007). That is, innovators have the potential to
create markets, to shape customer preferences and even to change the basic behaviour of
consumers (Zhou 2006), which, in summary, leads to higher proﬁts. From the above, we
propose that innovation enhances a company’s performance. These assumptions lead us to
establish our last hypothesis.

Hypothesis 10:

Innovative performance is positively associated with a higher level of
ﬁrm performance.

employees and (3) the company has an R&D department. The sectors with most patents,
according to data from the Spanish Ofﬁce of Patents, are the following: the manufacture of
machinery; the manufacture of motor vehicles; the manufacture of radios, TVs and
telecommunications equipment; and the chemicals industry. The DUNS 50,000 database
was used to obtain a list of the companies in those sectors with 50 or more employees.
A valid total population of 940 companies was obtained by this procedure. We conducted
follow-up telephone calls and reviewed company websites to identify the ﬁrms with an
R&D department. Deleting those without an R&D department yielded our ﬁnal population
of 619 ﬁrms.

Our approach involved ﬁrst contacting companies and then mailing a questionnaire,
with follow-ups, as proposed in the literature (Fox, Crask and Kim 1988; Cyciota and
Harrison 2001). The unit
in each company
was identiﬁed, and the manager responsible was contacted by telephone; the study was
explained, and the manager was notiﬁed when the questionnaire had been mailed. To
reduce the potential problems associated with single sourcing, following the Huber and
Power (1985) guidelines, we selected the person in each organization who had the most
knowledge about the variables under study, who was, in this case, the R&D manager.

in which innovation was carried out

Initially, a number of companies declined to participate in the study. These companies
were not surveyed but were still considered to form part of the total population. Periodic
reminders were sent to the companies that delayed completing the questionnaire, and by
the end of the ﬁeldwork stage, a total of 85 questionnaires had been completed and
returned; this represents 13.73% of the total population. Table 1 presents the technical data
sheet for the ﬁeld-work undertaken.

Table 2 gives that, for each selected sector, the sample and population proportions are
similar. The possibility of common method bias was tested using Harman’s one-factor test.

Principal components factor analysis on the questionnaire measurement items generated
factors with eigenvalues exceeding unity that account for 75.1% of the total variance.
Because several factors, rather than one single factor, were identiﬁed, and because the ﬁrst
factor accounts for only 12.29% of the variance, the common method variance does not
appear to be substantial (Podsakoff and Organ 1986).

Measurement of the variables: internal reliability and construct validity

To smooth out the complex problem of measuring latent or non-observable variables, and
because these variables are likely to be related, we apply the methodology used by, among
others, Putterill and Rohrer (1995). This involves using measurable surrogate indicators
for the unobservable variables. As stated above, the latent variables incorporated into the
theoretical model are the value and uniqueness of human capital, social capital, HRM
practices, and the innovative performance of the organization, which constitutes the
dependent variable. The observable indicators used for these variables are reported in
Table 3.

Human capital

Measurement of the value and uniqueness of human capital is based on the approach of
Lepak and Snell (2002). This variable comprises nine items measured on a Likert scale
from 1 to 7 (where 1 represents total disagreement and 7 represents total agreement). The
ﬁrst ﬁve items measured the value of individual knowledge and skills, and the remaining
four items measured the uniqueness of such skills. Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.906 and
0.770 indicated that the metrics exhibit both internal reliability and construct validity,
respectively; this is because of their unidimensional nature.

Social capital

The four items representing social capital are based on the work of Nahm, Vonderembse
and Koufteros (2003) and Subramaniam and Youndt (2005). These items measured
aspects such as the constancy of communication established among managers within their
own and other areas, and communication among employees within their area and with
other areas. A Likert scale of 1 to 7 (where 1 represents total disagreement and 7 represents

HRM practices

Measures of HRM practices were adapted from those developed by Lepak and Snell
(1999, 2002) in their analysis of human capital architecture. The speciﬁc items used were
those from their knowledge-based employment model and their collaborative model with
respect to collaboration and group works. The reason for this is that both models include
HRM practices that have been shown by existing studies to be determinants of human and
social capital. Measurement of these variables was based on a scale from 1 to 7 (where 1
represents almost never and 7 represents almost always).

The multidimensionality of the scale of HRM practices was studied. Four factors for
HRM practices were obtained. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy was 0.761, and

the Bartlett test was signiﬁcant at 99%. The factors extracted explained 68.38% of the total
variance of the HRM practices.

An examination of the factorial loadings in the matrix of rotated components allowed
us to name each of the principal components obtained. The ﬁrst principal component,
developmental practices, incorporates career options, speciﬁc training, mentoring and the
assessment of performance with feedback. The second factor incorporates the practices
of selection based on learning potential and interpersonal skills. The third principal
component combines the practice of compensation-based incentives for both individuals
and groups. Although we proposed separate hypotheses for selection criteria and
incentives, it seems that the ﬁrms in our sample use them jointly. The fourth factor
(empowerment) picks up the practice of empowerment. Table 3 provides information on
each component.

Innovative performance

We developed an innovative performance scale, based primarily on the Oslo Manual
(OECD/Eurostat 1997) and Cabello, Carmona and Valle (2006). It only includes output
indicators. The three items selected were ‘introduction of technologically new products
developed by the company (totally or partially) into the market, frequency of replacement
of old products with others that have undergone signiﬁcant change and proportion of
technologically new or improved products in the turnover of the company’. A 7-point scale
was used, ranging from (1) for less than the competition to (7) for more than the competition.
Because we use an ad hoc measure that is adapted from several existing ones, it is
important to study the reliability and validity of the scale. Exploratory factorial analysis
based on the method of principal components and varimax rotation showed that the
measure is unidimensional; the KMO sampling adequacy index was 0.704, and the Bartlett
test was signiﬁcant at 99%. The Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient of reliability for the totality
of the scale was 0.8, which is above the minimum of 0.7 recommended in the literature
(Tabachnick and Fidell 2001).

indicators of effectiveness and success relative to competitors’ ratings for these indicators
(a subjective measure). In our case, we used the objective measure to reduce the common
method variance error. That is, we use the ratio of total revenues divided by total assets as
an objective measure of proﬁts.

Control variables

We use size as a control variable. Research has demonstrated that a company’s size may be
linked to a greater or lesser tendency for innovation (Bantel and Jackson 1989). Some
scholars have established that an increase in the size of the organization implies a higher
number of resources and higher innovative potential, whereas other scholars have argued
that small organizations can be more innovative because they have more ﬂexibility, more
ability to adapt and less difﬁculty in accepting and implementing changes (Damanpour
1991). Following these arguments, we assume that a ﬁrm’s size has an inﬂuence on its
innovative activity. The organization size variable was measured by the number of
employees in the ﬁrm. The value of this variable ranges from 50 to 5000 workers. Because
of its wide dispersion, a Napierian logarithm of the number of workers in the ﬁrm has been
used to estimate this value, in order to avoid the scale effect.

Statistical analysis: the process of validation of the scales

We used structural equations modelling methodology for the statistical treatment of the
data for the measurement model and the structural model. There are two justiﬁcations for
this. First, using indicators to measure latent variables implies that there are measurement
errors. Therefore, we must investigate whether these indicators are valid and reliable
representations of the latent variables. Second, given that we wish to analyse simultaneous
relationships among latent variables, we must investigate whether the causal relationships
speciﬁed in the proposed model are consistent with the available data.

Thus, we perform the following checks for the reliability and validity of the scales.

(1) An analysis of dimensionality.
(2) An analysis of reliability.
(3) An analysis of discriminant validity.

To carry out the above checks, we use the statistics program EQS 6.1. Table 4 reports
the items retained as suitable indicators for measuring each construct. The table also
reports their factorial loadings.

Having presented the results relating to each scale, in Table 5, we report goodness-of-

ﬁt indices of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis, which are favourable in all cases.

On the basis of the procedure of Fornell and Larcker (1981), each factor exhibits
discriminant validity. For all cases, the mean extracted variances (from the principal
diagonal of Table 6) exceed the squares of the correlations between the factors.

Results

Using the EQS software package, we estimated structural equation models to test our
hypotheses. Table 7 gives the goodness-of-ﬁt indices of the model. The values of all
indicators are within accepted limits (Mueller 1996). Figure 2 illustrates the signiﬁcant
results from the model.

The ﬁrst set of hypotheses in our article (H1a, H1b and H2) relates human and social
capital with innovation. When we analysed such relationships, the only variable that had a

support H3.

A group of hypotheses (H4 to H9) assesses the relationships of certain HRM practices
with human and social capital. In this case, developmental HRM practices exert a positive
effect on the value of knowledge (b¼ 0.375; t ¼ 2.670). Empowerment is the only HRM
practice to increase signiﬁcantly the uniqueness of human capital (b¼ 0.228; t ¼ 2.038).
The ﬁnding that empowerment practices enhance the uniqueness of human capital was not
expected from the theoretical development of this article, but it was an interesting result
for discussion. Empowerment and involvement practices also have a signiﬁcantly positive
effect on social capital (b¼ 0.421; t ¼ 2.799) as does the orientation of selection
procedures (b¼ 0.475; t ¼ 3.811). Stafﬁng practices based on interpersonal skills and
learning potential also affect social capital;
these selection-procedure variables are
included in the same principal component factor, and it was not possible to differentiate
them into separate constructs. These results support H5, H6 and H7, but they imply
rejection of H4, H8 and H9.
innovative activity has a signiﬁcant positive inﬂuence on company
performance (b¼ 0.357; t ¼ 2.638). This result supports our H10. We did not ﬁnd any

Finally,

Discussion and conclusions

We have analysed how human and social capital can contribute to improving the
innovative performance of companies, and how social capital might enhance human
capital. We have also argued the leveraging effects of HRM practices on human and social
capital. Finally, we have proposed a nexus between innovative performance and ﬁrm
performance. We have empirically analysed these relationships based on data from the
R&D departments of a sample of Spanish industrial companies.

Interesting results have been obtained from our research. First, we have obtained
evidence that only one of the two characteristics of human capital, uniqueness, has a direct
and positive effect on ﬁrm innovativeness. That is, it seems that unique and rare
knowledge is what gives rise to new products that are different from those of competitors.
Nevertheless, contrary to our expectation, valuable human capital has not presented any
effect on innovation. This represents a surprising ﬁnding, which could be explained in the
sense that knowledge value may be a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for innovation
success. That
if the valuable knowledge were to be equally distributed across
organizations (valuable but not speciﬁc knowledge), it could hardly generate new ideas
and products that would enable organizations to differentiate themselves from each other.
This would be the case for the population of workers employed in the R&D units of
innovative companies, which are our study sample. They represent valuable knowledge
(the necessary condition), but not all of them own unique knowledge. Thus, having
employees with highly ﬁrm-speciﬁc KSA is what enhances a ﬁrm’s innovative

performance. This distinction among the different effects of both dimensions of human
capital on innovative performance is the ﬁrst contribution of this article to innovation
literature.

Second, it seems that social capital does not have, per se, a direct inﬂuence on
innovation. This result does not reduce the importance of social capital for innovation,
but it may reﬂect differently the nature of this inﬂuence. In this sense, social capital
contributes to the improvement of innovation performance, though not directly but
through its positive effect on unique human capital. As has been suggested by Reed et al.
(2006), social interaction enables companies more easily to combine knowledge in such
a way that the KSA of individuals become more ﬁrm speciﬁc and idiosyncratic, and thus
more difﬁcult for competitors to imitate. That is, our results suggest that human capital
plays a mediating role in the relationship between social capital and innovation, whereas
other researchers (Subramaniam and Youndt 2005) contend that it is social capital that
moderates the relationships between human capital and innovation.

Third, concerning the question of whether HRM practices could reinforce human and
social capital, the obtained results conﬁrm that not all the HRM practices do this in a
signiﬁcant way. In particular, we have found that social capital could be enhanced by the
selection of individuals with learning potential and interpersonal skills, as well as by their
involvement in decision-making processes. These results are consistent with the ﬁnding
of Swart and Kinnie (2003), who identiﬁed the abilities of candidates to collaborate as a
key criterion in the selection process for knowledge-intensive ﬁrms. These companies
need to utilize this kind of selection process in order to ensure interconnections between

employees’ knowledge and the building of social capital. Similarly, it can be argued that
empowerment practices motivate employees to share their knowledge, to increase the
exchange of information and to enable informal relationships (social capital).

Fourth, we also found that each dimension of human capital can be enhanced by means
of different HRM practices, and this ﬁnding represents an interesting contribution to
HRM literature. Although developmental practices enhance the value of human capital,
empowerment and involvement practices improve its uniqueness. This interesting result
suggests that training and career development (developmental practices) would provide
individuals with a broader base of knowledge about
increasing
knowledge value and favouring internal mobility. Nevertheless, such practices would not
lead to deeper knowledge, which seems to be enhanced by empowerment. In this sense,
when an employee is empowered, he or she has to ﬁnd new solutions to concrete issues
and internal work problems, which demands higher knowledge levels. Thus, the skills of
empowered employees would become more rare and ﬁrm speciﬁc.

the organization,

Fifth, contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that providing individual and
group incentives enhances either employee knowledge or team knowledge leading to the
promotion of innovation. A possible explanation for this result is provided by Amabile
(1998), who argues that innovation requires creativity, which cannot be generated by salary
incentives but requires intrinsic compensatory practices. Similarly, Gupta and Singhal
(1993) recommend that companies should use promotions and awards, rather than monetary
compensation, to reward the creation of new products. Thamhain (2003) also ﬁnds that
compensation has little impact on innovation by teams. These insights suggest that
using compensation to reward innovative results rather than innovative behaviour, and
eschewing non-monetary forms of compensation, diminishes the innovation performance of
work teams. Furthermore, because predicting and measuring the results of innovation is
difﬁcult, using result-based incentives may not be an effective way of motivating employees
to innovate. All of the above considerations help us to understand the role of incentives when
the activity results are uncertain, as it occurs in innovation activities. Finally, as we expected,
innovative performance had a positive effect on ﬁrm performance. This supports arguments
in the literature in favour of innovation as a source of competitive advantage.

Despite its contributions, our study has its limitations. First, because the sample size is
not sufﬁcient to allow segmentation based on the sectors incorporated in the population,
we could not control for sector effects. Second, our measure of innovative performance
is based on managerial perceptions rather than on secondary data. This last limitation
represents an opportunity for future research.

Interesting implications for HRM in R&D departments emerge from our results. That
is, R&D departments should incorporate HRM practices that aim to enhance both the
uniqueness of human capital and social capital, which in turn have effects on innovation
performance. On the one hand, by means of empowerment, the uniqueness of knowledge
can be enhanced, which will directly contribute to improving innovation results. On the
other hand, by means of selection processes based on the ability of candidates to
collaborate, and by empowerment practices, managers will create conditions favourable
to the sharing of information and the building of social capital, which, in turn, will enhance
the uniqueness of human capital.
