Based  on  an  organizational  adaptation framework, this  study  examines  the  influence  of 
three environmental dimensions-munificence,  stability, and complexity-on  top management 
team  turnover.  In  addition  to  investigating  the  direct  influence  of  these  environmental 
dimensions,  indirect  effects  through  firm  performance  and  strategic  change  are  also 
examined; the indirect effect of environmental complexity through demographic heterogeneity 
is  also  studied.  Path  analysis  indicates  that  the  direct  effects  of  the  three  environmental 
dimensions predominate. Indirect effects were nonsignificant except for the effect of  instability 
and  mun8cence  through  strategic  change.  By  expanding  the  team  turnover  context  to 
include  environmental  and  strategic  dimensions,  in  addition  to  previously  examined 
performance and heterogeneity factors, this study enhances our understanding of  managerial 
turnover as  a form of  organizational adaptation. 

A  key  theoretical  perspective  in  the  strategy 
and  organizational  theory  areas  is  that  firm 
performance  is  highly  related  to  the  dynamic, 
evolutionary  nature  of  the  fit  between  environ- 
ment and organization (Romanelli and Tushman, 
1988). Yet,  the  adaptation  of  the  organization 
to  shifting  external  demands  does  not  occur 
readily. A major debate in the literature revolves 
around  whether  leaders  can  strongly  influence 
this  fit  through  strategic  decisions  and  actions 
(Child,  1972),  or  whether  resource  constraints 
(Hannan  and  Freeman,  1977)  and  institution- 
alized  norms  (Zucker,  1983) severely  constrain 
decision-makers. 

A  growing  body  of  literature  offers  support 
for  the  criticality  of  executive  leadership  in 
creating  a  fit  of 
the  organization  with  its 
environment,  summarized  by  Romanelli  and 
Tushman as follows (1988: 130): ‘Where environ-

ments are changing and/or performance outcomes 
are low or declining, leadership’s primary task is 
to intervene on ongoing patterns of  commitment 
and  exchange  to  redirect  the  character  of  an 
organization’s relationship with its environment .’ 
To  be  successful  in  their  leadership  roles,  top 
executives must  be  vigilant  in  their  monitoring 
of environmental conditions to determine whether 
the  current  fit  with  the  firm  is  appropriate  or 
whether strategic interventions are necessary. As 
the process of  interpreting information  from the 
environment 
the 
cognition  of  top  managers  plays  an  important 
role in  determining the  quality and timeliness of 
such  interpretations,  key  in  forging  a  viable  fit 
(Schwenk, 1988). Managers’ perceptions of reality 
and  problem-solving  frameworks  reflect  their 
backgrounds 
experiences 
(Mintzberg,  Raisinghani,  and  Theoret,  1976; 
Starbuck and Milliken,  1988); managers’ unique 
backgrounds thus greatly influence the adaptation 
and direction of  the organization (Selznick, 1957; 
Donaldson and Lorsch,  1984; Schwenk, 1988).

While firm success is linked to a good alignment 
between  top  team  members’  cognition  and  the 
firm’s environment, a poor match  might arise  if 
members  fail  to  update  their  perspectives  in  a 
dynamic environmental setting or if  teams fail to 
act  upon  a  shift  in  environmental  conditions 
because  their  power  base  is  rooted  in  existing 
strategic  approaches.  Top  teams  tend  to  act  as 
stable governance structures that can restrict the 
firm’s ability to change (Tushman and Romanelli, 
1985; Brady  and  Helmich,  1984; Meyer,  1972). 
When  it  becomes  apparent  that  the  team’s 
cognitions anti strategic decision-making behavior 
do  not  fit  the  environmental  context,  a  crisis 
leading  to  top  executive  replacement  occurs 
(Tushman and Romanelli, 1985); a better match 
through  executive turnover  is  often  ensured  by 
the board  of  directors (Fama and Jensen, 1983). 
As  a  result,  the  replacement  of  top  executives 
provides an important mechanism for the organi- 
zation to overcome inertia (Tushman  and Rom- 
anelli, 1985) and to adapt strategically to changing 
contexts  (Helmich,  1077; Pfeffer  and  Salancik, 
1978; Vancil, 1987). 

While  turnover  within  the  management  team 
appears  to  he  critical  to  successful  firm  func- 
tioning,  most  past  research  has  concentrated 
solely on CEO turnover, particularly as it relates 
to  the  financial performance  of  the  firm.  Many 
studies  have  established  a  link  between  poor 
performance  and  an  increased  rate  of  CEO 
turnover  (Beatty and Zajac, 1987; Coughlan and 
Schmidt,  1985; Lieberson  and  O’Connor,  1979; 
McEachern,  1977;  Salancik  and  Pfeffer,  1977; 
Warner,  Watts  and  Wruck,  1988). Furtado  and 
Karan  (1990), in  their  review  of  the  literature, 
conclude,  however,  that  other  factors also play 
major  roles.  Other  studies have  identified such 
contextual  factors  as  CEO  power  (Allen  and 
Panian,  1982), ownership and board of  directors 
issues (Goodstein and Boeker,  1991), and socio- 
political  constructs (Fredrickson,  Hambrick  and 
Baumrin,  1988) as important influences. 

Our  focus  on  the  top  team  is  consistent with 
the  ‘upper  echelon’  perspective  proposed  by 
Hambrick and Mason (1984) and is supported by 
recent empirical research on the important influence 
of  top teams on strategic and performance issues 
(Murray,  1989;  Michel  and  Hambrick,  1992; 
Wiersema  and  Bantel,  1992).  The  theoretical 
rationale for focusing on the entire team as a unit 
is based  on  the  collective responsibility members 

share to determine organizational outcomes. Mem- 
bers  interact  as  a  decision-making group;  group 
dynamics and each member’s cognitive perspective, 
personality, and  power  influence the  outcome of 
the strategic decision process. Further, studies that 
have  compared  explained  variance  using  CEOs 
versus the  entire team  have found that  the  team 
analysis  is  superior  (Bantel  and  Jackson,  1989; 
Finkelstein, 1988; Iiage  and  Dewar,  1973; Tush- 
man, Virany and Romanelli, 1985). 

instability, 

Only  a  few  studies  to  date  have  focused 
specifically on turnover within the top team, and 
these  were  limited  to  establishing  a  link  with 
demographic heterogeneity (Jackson et al., 1991; 
Wagner,  Pfeffer  and  O’Reilly,  1984), poor  firm 
performance  (Wagner et  al.,  1984), and  merger/ 
acquisition activity (Walsh and  Ellwood,  1991). 
This research is aimed at providing an enhanced 
understanding of  the team turnover phenomenon 
by utilizing an adaptation framework and focusing 
on the firm’s environmental context. A compre- 
hensive model of  team turnover as an adaptation 
mechanism  is  developed  in  which  the  direct 
influences 
three 
environmental 
constructs-munificence, 
and 
complexity--are  examined.  Further,  the indirect 
influence  of  the  environment  through  strategic 
change and firm performance is also investigated. 
Finally,  the  effect  of  environmental  complexity 
through  demographic  heterogeneity  is  also con- 
sidered.  Such  a comprehensive  model  not  only 
will  provide insight into  the role  of  the environ- 
ment  and  strategic  change  in  relation  to  team 
turnover, but will also clarify previous findings on 
firm performance and demographic heterogeneity. 
An  additional  analysis  will  be  conducted  to 
examine  whether  the  predictors  of  turnover  in 
our  model  have  a  differential  impact  on  team 
members based on their hierarchical level within 
the top team.  Beyond  our analysis of  the entire 
team, our model will also be examined separately 
for 
the  first

second tiers  (senior vice presidents).

tional  growth  (Aldrich,  1979;  Starbuck,  1976). 
Such  capacity  will  buffer  organizations  within 
that  environment  from  external  and  internal 
hostilities and  enable the  accumulation  of  slack 
resources  within  the  organization  (Cyert  and 
March,  1963). Top  managers  thus  are  able  to 
exercise high discretion in their strategic planning 
and  decision  making,  unfettered  by  external 
demands  (Hambrick  and Finkelstein,  1987) and 
insulated from having to respond to misalignment 
of  the  firm  with  its  environment.  It  is  not  a 
surprise  that  slack has  been  found  to  assist  the 
organization in  maintaining stability in  organiza- 
tional coalitions (Bourgeois,  1981). 

Lack  of  environmental  munificence,  by  con- 
trast, creates difficult and stressful conditions for 
managers.  Lack  of  munificence implies little  or 
no  organizational  slack,  conditions  of  scarcity, 
and  a  threat  to the  firm’s survival.  Scarcity and 
threat,  in  turn,  have  been  associated  with  a 
variety  of  organizational  responses,  including 
formalization,  centralization,  decreased  infor- 
mation  processing,  and  restriction  of  communi- 
cation and control (Staw, Sandelands and Dutton, 
1981;  Zammuto,  1983).  This  results  in  less 
decision-making  discretion 
for  management, 
more  rigid  problem-solving  and  adherence  to 
traditional  routines  (Yasai-Ardekani,  1989) and 
thus  decision-making that  is  based  on  outdated 
information and perspectives. As the inappropri- 
ateness of  strategic decisions becomes apparent, 
and  top  managers  are  perceived  as  unable  to

industry 
(industries)  in  which  the  firm  participates  helps 
define the firm’s involvement with its environment 
as well as the nature of  resources needed for firm 
survival. Based on a review of  a variety of  authors 
involved in conceptualizing and measuring the task 
environment, Sharfman and Dean (1991) conclude 
that there are three specific environmental dimen- 
sions  identified  as  among  the  most  critical  in 
ensuring  the  firm’s  survival:  munificence,  insta- 
bility,  and  complexity.  Following  these  authors 
and the  work of  Keats and Hitt  (1988) and Dess 
and  Beard  (1984),  these  three  dimensions  were 
examined in this study for their potential influence 
on top team turnover. 

As shown in Figure 1, these three environmen- 
tal dimensions are expected  to have main effects 
on  top  team  turnover.  Indirect  effects  through 
strategic  change  and  firm performance  are  also 
examined.  Finally,  environmental  complexity  is 
expected  to  have  an  indirect  effect  through 
demographic  heterogeneity.  The  following  sec- 
tions  provide  additional  theoretical  support  for 
the  development  of  the  model. 

Environmental munificence 
Environmental  munificence refers  to  the  ability 
or capacity of the environment to permit organiza-

manage the firm’s affairs, they may feel pressure 
to  leave  the  firm.  Additionally,  managers  may 
choose  to  leave  a  situation  in  which  their 
autonomy, creativity, ilnd discretion are severely 
challenged.  Finally, 
lack  of  environmental 
munificence  may  also  motivate  cost-cutting  on 
the  part  of  the  firm.  Industrial  environments 
with  limited  growth  opportunities  often  lead 
firms  to  restructure  and  rationalize  their  oper- 
ations,  which  may  include  reducing  the  size of 
their top management teams. 

Hypothesis  1:  Environmental  munificence  will 
be  negatively  associated  with  turnover  within 
the top management  team. 

Environmental instability 
Environmental  instability  refers  to  the  rate 
of  unpredictable  change  or  turnover  in  those 
environmental  factors  pertinent 
to  strategic 
decision-making  (Duncan,  1972; Sharfman  and 
Dean, 1991). Stable environments enable organi- 
to  manage  by  established  routines 
zations 
(Aldrich, 1979; Porter,  1980) as learning require- 
ments  are  minimal  (Tushman and  Keck,  1990). 
A key role of top managers in stable environments 
is  to  manage  symbolically  (Ancona,  1990)  by 
legitimating  and  enforcing  the  current  system 
and  core  values  (Tushman  and  Keck,  1990), 
while  relying  on  routinized  problem  solving 
(Eisenhardt, 1989). 

in  environmental  instability 

Environmental  instability,  in  contrast,  places 
tremendous cognitive demands on executives and 
can also threaten their power bases. A difficulty 
inherent 
the 
constant  need  to adapt  one’s perception  of  the 
environment  to  fit  its  current  reality.  While 
managers  must  change  their  routine  problem- 
solving  habits  by  being  more  structured  and 
vigilant in  environmental scanning and  problem 
solving (Ancona, 1990: Eisenhardt,  1989), many 
managers will  be  very  reluctant  to  expend  such 
time and effort (Tushman and Anderson,  1986), 
because they are unwilling to abandon their past 
frames  of  reference  (Fiske  and  Taylor,  1984). 
This might be particularly true for top managers 
who  have  gained  their  organizational  power  in 
part through their ability to handle environmental 
contingencies  (Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978);  a 
shift in those contingencies threatens to decrease 
the  power  of  top  managers (Hambrick,  1981b). 

is 

Finally, research on organizational groups points 
out a further reason why established teams might 
be reluctant to respond to environmental change. 
Group  longevity  and  cohesion  influence  infor- 
mation-processing  behaviors  by  reducing  the 
group’s  willingness  to  search  out  and  actively 
internalize  new  or  conflicting  knowledge 
(Caldwell  and  O’Reilly,  1982; Janis  and  Mann, 
1977; Katz,  1982; Pelz and Andrews,  1966). 

It is not surprising, therefore, that environmen- 
tal  instability  is  the  factor  mentioned  most 
frequently  as  leading  to  externally  induced 
changes within  the  organization  (Aldrich,  1979; 
Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978).  Instability in  such 
factors as the socioeconomic and supplier environ- 
ments has been linked to CEO turnover (Osborn, 
Hunt  and  Jauch,  ‘1980; Pfeffer  and  Leblebici, 
1973; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), while Tushman 
and  Keck  (1990)  found  that  technological jolts 
in  the  environment  of  the  cement  industry  led 
to executive team  turnover. 

Hypothesis 2: Environmental  instability  will be 
positively  associated  with  turnover  within  the 
top management  team. 

Environmental complexity 
Environmental complexity pertains to the hetero- 
geneity  in  and  range  of  environmental  factors 
that  need to be considered in  strategic decision- 
making (Child, 1972; Duncan, 1972). As organiza- 
tions  in  a  given  industry  expand  their  product 
and  market  activity,  the  variety  of  inputs  and 
outputs  with  which  they  must  cope  increases 
environmental  complexity  (Dess  and  Beard, 
1984), as  does the  need  for  increased  strategic 
activities (Aldrich,  1979). Such  firms also  need 
to  interact  with  multiple  constituencies  whose 
demands  often  conflict.  Thus,  a  higher  infor- 
mation processing demand results from environ- 
mental complexity (Dess and Beard, 1984; Pfeffer 
and Salancik, 1978; Terreberry ,1968; Thompson, 
1967), the management of which is an inherently 
more difficult management  task. 

As environmental complexity creates demands 
from  a  variety  of  external  interest  groups,  the 
organization responds by  becoming more highly 
differentiated 
(Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978; 
Thompson,  1967), also reflected in the executive 
team.  As  members  of  the  top  team  attempt  to 
respond  to  the  diversity  and  complexity  of  the 


firm’s environment, they will tend  to focus more 
of  their attention on scanning the greater variety 
and  number  of  relevant  environmental  sectors 
(Daft,  Sormunen, and Parks,  1988). Over time, 
individual team  members will  tend  to specialize 
in  particular  environmental  sectors  (Hambrick, 
1981a) and will become highly differentiated with 
regard  to their experiences, attitudes,  priorities, 
and  perspectives  (Lawrence  and  Lorsch,  1967; 
Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978;  Thompson,  1967). 
As these varying perspectives are juxtaposed  and 
analyzed,  the  result  can  be  conflict (Dougherty, 
1987),  difficulty  in  communication  (McCain, 
O’Reilly,  and  Pfeffer,  1983),  power  struggles 
(Pfeffer,  1983), lack of  consensus (Dess,  1987), 
and lack of  attachment to the team (Roberts and 
O’Reilly, 1979). Greater cognitive differentiation 
has been linked to lower integration and cohesive- 
ness within a group and, in turn, to higher levels 
turnover  (McCain  et  al.,  1983;  O’Reilly, 
of 
Caldwell and Barnett,  1989). 

Hypothesis  3:  Environmental  complexity  will 
be  positively  associated  with  turnover  within 
the top management team. 

INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT ON  TOP TEAM 
TURNOVER 
Environment, performance, and top team 
turnover 
The three  environmental  dimensions might  also 
influence top  team  turnover  indirectly  through 
the  effect  of  firm  performance.  Each  of  the 
environmental constructs is expected to link with 
firm performance. First, an environment  lacking 
in munificence offers limited growth opportunity 
which  leads,  in  turn,  to  intensive  competitive 
dynamics  as  firms  seeking  to  expand  must 
attack competitors’ market  shares (Porter,  1980). 
Intensified  competitive  rivalry  accompanied  by 
price  competition results in  lower profitability in 
the industry and its firms (Porter,  1980). Second, 
environmental  instability  has  a  similar  influence 
on firm performance in that it reflects competitive 
instability  within  the  industry.  Unstable-thus, 
highly cornpetitive-market  conditions indicate that 
some firms are gaining market share at the expense 
of  others  (Porter,  1980), leading  again  to  lower 
industry  and  firm  performance.  Finally,  environ-

mental complexity might also lead to reduced firm 
performance. Increased variety and diversity of  a 
firm’s  business  operations  suggest  that  a  wider 
range and greater quantity of  information need to 
be processed for effective decision making, creating 
strains on the organization to achieve high quality 
decision making outcomes. Differentiation in per- 
spectives and the lack of shared information among 
team members can contribute to lower consensus 
within the top team (Dess, 1987) and this, in turn, 
has  been  linked  to  lower performance  outcomes 
(Bourgeois, 1980; Dess, 1987). 

Hypothesis 4a: Environmental munijicence will 
be positively associated with Jim performance. 

Hypotheis  4b:  Environmental  instability  will 
be negatively associated with firm performance. 

Hypothesis  4c: Environmental  complexity  will 
be negatively associated with firm performance. 

A period of  poor  firm performance represents a 
potentially  risky  situation  for  the  firm  as  con- 
sumers  and  investors  lose  confidence  in  its 
viability and strength. As the firm’s top managers 
are generally held accountable for firm perform- 
ance,  persistently  poor  performance  is  likely  to 
be attributed to the decisions and actions (or the 
lack  thereof)  of  the  top  management  team.  A 
variety of  studies has found that such attributions 
are made and that turnover of  top team members 
can  result.  Good  performance  has  been  found 
to  result  in  high  levels  of  CEO  tenure,  while 
poor  performance  is  likely  to  lead  to  CEO 
turnover  (or  firing)  (Allen,  Panian  and  Lotz, 
1979; Coughlan  and  Schmidt,  1985; Eitzen  and 
Yetman,  1972; Gamson and Scotch, 1964; James 
and Soref, 1981; McEachern, 1977; Salancik and 
Pfeffer,  1977; Warner  et  al.,  1988).  Wagner  et 
al.  (1984)  also  found  a  link  between  poor  firm 
performance  and turnover within the top team. 

Hypothesis  4d:  Firm  performance  will  be 
negatively associated  with  turnover  within the 
top management team. 

Environment, strategic change, and top team 
turnover 
By  developing  a  coherent  strategy,  top  man-

the firm that is conducive to reasonable success; 
as such, the nature of  the environment largely 
determines  the  need  for  strategic  change.  To 
ameliorate the  effects of  a  poor  environment, 
top  management  can  redirect  the  corporate 
strategy  of 
the  firm  through  divestment  and 
diversification decisions which shift the business 
portfolio  and, thus, the business environments. 
Lack  of  environmental  munificence,  environ- 
mental 
instability,  and  environmental  com- 
plexity  all  represent  difficult  and  threatening 
environmental  conditions  that  top  managers 
may decide to withdraw from or, at a minimum, 
to  reduce  the  firm’s involvement  in. 

Hypothesis  5a:  Environmental  munificence 
will  be  negatively  associated  with  strategic 
change. 

Hypothesis  5b: Environmental  instability  will 
be positively  associated  with strategic change. 

Hypothesis  5c:  Environmental  complexity 
will  be  positively  associated  with  strategic 
change. 

A  shift  in  a  firm’s strategy,  particularly  at  the 
corporate  level  where  entirely  new  businesses 
might  be  entered  and  old  businesses  dropped, 
represents a change in  the requisite  managerial 
operating  knowledge,  experience,  cognition, 
and  perspectives.  Prahalad  and  Bettis  (1986) 
describe how  top managers of  a diversified firm 
develop  a  distinct  management  skill,  which 
they  label  the  ‘dominant  general  management 
logic’.  It is based  on a shared set of  managers’ 
mental  schemas  (Kiesler  and  Sproull,  1982) 
and  is  developed  for  each  set  of  similar 
businesses;  it  enables top managers  to concep- 
tualize  the  businesses  and  make  resource  allo- 
cation decisions. This ‘dominant logic’ tends to 
evolve from the requirements of  the largest,  or 
‘core’,  business  from  which  the  firm  originally 
grew. When a shift occurs in the key businesses 
of  the  firm,  the  established  ‘dominant  logic’ 
may  limit  the  managers’  ability  to  shift  their 
management  approach  (Prahalad  and  Bettis, 
1986). Turnover  within  the top team is needed 
to accomplish the shift in managerial perspective 
necessary to develop a new and more appropri- 
ate  ‘dominant  logic’ for  the  changed  portfolio 
of  businesses. 

Hypothesis  5d:  Strategic  change  will  be 
positively  associated  with  turnover  within  the 
top management  team. 

Past  research  on  the  link  between  strategic 
change  and  turnover  has  tended  to  emphasize 
strategy at the business, rather than the corporate, 
level and to focus on the reverse causality of  the 
one  argued  here,  i.e.,  turnover  among the  top 
team  occurs  as  members’  inertia  and  lack  of 
strategic adaptation  become apparent (Tushman 
and  Romanelli,  1985). The  assumption made in 
this prior work is that, over time, members tend 
to become increasingly specialized and less open 
to new environmental  information (Katz,  1982), 
which results in more narrow and parochial views 
of  the  firm  and  its  main  business.  Turnover  is 
then  linked  to  strategic  change  as  the  new 
members’  perspectives  and  expertise  represent 
a  better  and  more  appropriate  fit  with  the 
environment  (Tushman and Romanelli,  1985). 

In contrast, we are suggesting that top managers 
operating at the level of  corporate strategy must 
focus  on  the  ‘big picture’  as  they  manage  the 
firm’s portfolio.  As the operating results for any 
individual  business  tend  to  be  straightforward, 
these  managers  are,  indeed,  able  to  respond 
to  environmental  demands  and  pressures  by 
reconfiguring the businesses in the firm’s portfolio 
to  improve  its  corporate  competitive  position. 
The  successful  managing  of  these  new  sets  of 
businesses  then  involves the  acquisition  of  the 
requisite operating ‘logics’ (Prahalad  and Bettis, 
1986)  supplied  by  new  team  members  after  a 
turnover. 

Environmental complexity, demographic 
heterogeneity, and team turnover 
A  further  effect  on  team  turnover  is  expected 
when environmental complexity is combined with 
team  demographic  heterogeneity.  As  described 
earlier,  environmental  complexity 
to 
increased  differentiation  of  perspective  among 
the  firm’s  managers;  one  way  in  which  such 
differentiation  occurs  is  through  demographic 
heterogeneity.  An 
individual’s  demographic 
characteristics  are  indicators  of  that  person’s 
underlying experiences, training, cognitive orien- 
tation, attitudes, and perspectives (Dearborn and 
Simon,  1959; Vroom  and Pahl,  1971). Thus, an

heterogeneity  is  likely  as  it  grapples  with  the 
demands of  a complex environment. 

Hypothesis  6a: Environmental complexity  will 
be positively  associated  with demographic het- 
erogeneity. 

Demographically  heterogeneous  groups,  while 
benefiting  from  the  creativity  resulting  from 
cognitive  diversity  (Wanous  and  Youtz,  1986), 
will  experience the same difficulties in  communi- 
cation and cohesiveness as were described earlier 
for

teams. 

Hypothesis 66: Demographic heterogeneity will 
be  positively  associated  with  turnover  within 
the top management team. 

The differential impact of  turnover  predictors 
based on top team hierarchical level 
While our theoretical  model pertains to the top 
management  team  as  a  whole,  it  is  possible 
that  the  predictors  might  have  a  differential 
effect  on  managers based  on  their  hierarchical 
level within  the team. The top tier  (Chairman, 
CEO, President,  and/or COO) might  be  some- 
what more immune to the pressures for turnover 
we  are analyzing; we would thus see a stronger 
effect for managers at the second tier (managers 
at some level  of  vice-president  rank). 

One  potential  reason  for  such  a  pattern  is 
the  higher  power  of  the  top  tier;  the  CEO 
tends  to be  the  most  powerful  member  of  the 
team,  although  there  are  exceptions  to  this 
(Mintzberg,  1983).  Generally,  such  issues  as 
interpersonal  or  group  dynamics  difficulties 
would  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  top  tier 
member.  Vice  presidents  would  also  tend  to 
have  higher  accountability  on  such  specific 
performance 
indicators  as  financial  results, 
market share, and growth of  their division(s). If 
performance  on these  indicators  is  insufficient, 
corporate  level  strategic  change  could  include 
divestment  of 
that  member’s  division(s)  and 
loss  of  his  or  her  job.  Vice  presidents  might 
be the scapegoats in such a situation as the top 
tier  managers  refuse  to  take  responsibility  for 
poor  operating  results (Boeker,  1992). 

Top Management Team  Turnover 

491 

Further,  there  are  institutional  pressures  for 
retaining the  top tier  at the helm,  except in  the 
case  of  extreme  crisis.  Investors,  consumers, 
governmental agencies and other constituents of 
the firm rely on the image of  a stable, competent 
leadership  at  the  top  (Zucker,  1983);  only  the 
very top echelon  members are generally  known 
to these  groups.  As  such  the  replacement  of  a 
top  tier  member  might  be  construed  by  the 
constituent community as an indication of serious 
firm  trouble,  a  circumstance the  firm  would  try 
to  avoid. 

To  investigate the  possibility of  a  differential 
impact  of  the  predictors  based  on  hierarchical 
level, an additional analysis will  be conducted in 
which  the  top  team  will  be  segmented  into  two 
tiers. 

In summary, turnover within the top manage- 
ment  team  is expected  to be influenced directly 
by the three environmental dimensions of munifi- 
cence, instability, and complexity. Further, their 
indirect  influence  through  firm  performance, 
strategic change, and demographic heterogeneity 
is also examined.  These effects are expected to 
have  a  differential  impact  according  to  hier- 
archical  level  within  the  team,  with  stronger 
effects occurring at the second tier. 

METHODS 
Sample and data 
A  random  sample  of  100  firms  from  the  500 
largest manufacturing  firms in  1980, as  listed in 
Fortune, was  selected  for  study.  Availability of 
the  Economic  Information  System’s I’RINET  line 
of  business  data  and  Census  of  Manufacturing 
data determined  the  choice  of  time  period  for 
this study.  From the initial sample of  100 firms, 
15  firms  were  dropped  due  to  lack  of  data 
availability,  leaving a  sample  of  85  firms.’  The 
sample was distributed by Fortune 100 increments 
as  follows:  1-100:  14 firms;  100-200:  14 firms; 

Of  the  original  100 firms  in  the  sample,  15  firms  were 
eliminated because of  data collection problems. Several firms 
lacked TRINET data for the  1980 to  1983 period because they 
either represented divisions of larger, multinational companies 
or  were  no  longer  individual  corporate  entities,  making 
financial and strategic data unavailable. The eliminated firms 
were  not  statistically different  from  the  sample of  85  firms 
in terms of  either revenue or the rate of  top team turnover.

200-300: 17 firms; 300-400: 23 firms; and 4W500: 
17  firms. 

Our selection of  data  sources was  predicated 
on  the  need  for  detailed  industry  level  data  to 
assess  the  firm’s  industrial  environment.  Our 
industry level data comes from either the Census 
of  Manufacturers or the  U.S. Statistical Abstract, 
both  of  which  provide  manufacturing  sector 
information  at  the  four-digit  SIC  level.  To 
maintain compatibility of  our  data,  we  chose to 
utilize  the  TIUNET  data  base  to  assess  line  of 
business  activity,  since  its  establishment  level 
data is  also collected at the four-digit SIC level. 
As Davis and Duhaime (1992: 522) indicate: ‘the 
compatibility  of  data  bases  is  important  when 
industry trends  are  studied  in  conjunction  with 
firm’s data.’ 

This study utilizes a definition of  the top team 
to include the two highest levels of  management 
within  a  firm.  what  we call the  top and  second 
tier  of  management.  The  composition  of  each 
team  was  ascertained  by  the  hierarchical listing 
of  a  firm’s executives in  the  Reference  Book  of 
Corporate  Managements  (Dun  &  Bradstreet, 
1977,  1980,  1983).  The  top  tier  includes  the 
following executive positions:  Chairman,  CEO, 
President, and COO. The number of  individuals 
in  the  top  tier  varies  from  one  (a  combined 
Chairman, CEO, President) to three, with a firm 
average of  1.7. The second tier includes only the 
most senior level of  Vice President listed for the 
firm,  thus  it  could  include  the  following titles: 
executive  vice-president,  group  vice-president, 
senior  vice-president,  or  vice-president,  The 
number  of  individuals in  the  second tier  varied 
from one (Executive Vice President) to six, with 
a firm  average of  2.8. 

By  including  only  the  two  upper  levels  of 
management  in  our  definition of  the  team,  we 
have  maintained  consistency  in  the  degree  of 
responsibility  and  scope of  members  of  the top 
team. The sample of  85 firms had 380 individuals 
within  the  top  management  team.  The  average 
size  of  the  top  team  was  4.5  members,  with  a 
standard  deviation  of  1.8.  The  average  mean 
team  tenure  of  the  top  management  team  was 
9.5  years,  supporting  our  assumption  that  this 
set of  managers was responsible for dealing with 
the  environment  during  the  time  preceding  the 
turnover  period  under  investigation  (the  dates 
for data collection for each variables are discussed 
below). 

Measures 

Top management  team  turnover 

Turnover  within  the  top  management  team  is 
defined  as  the  proportion  of  team  members  in 
1980 who were  no  longer with  the  firm  in  1983 
and were  less than  65  years of  age in  1983. By 
eliminating  managers  equal  to  or  greater  than 
65  years  of  age  in  1983,  we  control  for  the 
effects of  normal retirements, consistent with the 
approach  used  by  Puffer  and  Weintrop  (1991). 
The  absence  or  presence  of  individuals  in  the 
top  management  team  was  ascertained  by  the 
executive  listings  in  the  Reference  Book  of 
Corporate  Managements  (Dun  and  Bradstreet, 
1980, 1983). The three-year  window was chosen 
because it represents  a long enough time period 
for  sufficient  turnover 
to  occur  within  the 
executive team,  yet  is  short  enough to see  the 
effects of  demographic  heterogeneity  measured 
in  1980. 

Environment 
In  understanding  the  interaction  between  the 
organization  and  its  environment,  researchers 
have  focused on  defining  organization  environ- 
ments in terms of  the resources required  by  the 
firm  (Dess  and  Beard,  1984).  Specifically, the 
core  of  a  firm’s environment  is  represented  by 
its  competitors,  suppliers,  and  customers.  This 
arena  represents  the  firm’s  industrial  environ- 
ment.  We  limit  consideration  of 
the  firm’s 
environment to its industry environment, consist- 
ent with  Dess and Beard  (1984) and with more 
recent  empirical  work  examining  the  environ- 
ment-firm interface (Keats and Hitt,  1988). 

In contrast to prior studies concentrating on a 
single industry, our sample consists of  diversified 
manufacturing enterprises operating  in  multiple 
industries. Operationalization of  a multibusiness 
firm’s environment  necessitates deriving a  com- 
posite  measure  that  includes  all  of  the  firm’s 
industrial environments. For each firm, a measure 
of  the environment was calculated by  multiplying 
the firm’s relative sales for each industry by  that 
industry’s data;  each  of  these  results  was  then 
aggregated,  resulting  in  a  weighted  industry 
portfolio  measure  for  each  firm  as  follows:  8 
Environment, Pi, where Environmenti represents 
the  average  of  the  appropriate  environmental 


characteristics for each four-digit SIC(i) in which 
a  firm participated  and  Pi is  the  proportion  of 
sales  in  the  SIC.  The  time  period  of  1977-80 
was selected as it precedes the examined turnover 
period  (1980-83). 

Environmental munijicence 
Based on Starbuck’s (1976) concept, munificence 
captures  the  extent  to  which  the  environment 
can  provide  sustained  growth.  We  utilize  a 
growth-based measure, sales growth, as it reflects 
abundance in  terms of  opportunities for market 
expansion.  While  this  variable  represents  only 
the  measures  identified  by  Dess  and 
one  of 
Beard  in  their  factor  analysis of  munificence, it 
appears  to  strongly  underlie  their  construct. 
While  Sharfman  and  Dean  (1991)  argue  that 
industry  competition  should  be  included  in  the 
munificence  construct,  competition  does  not 
address  the  abundance  issue.  Regardless  of  the 
number of  players in  an industry, higher growth 
markets  generally  represent  more  abundant 
environments (Porter, 1980), while slow industry 
growth results in  a  market  share game for firms 
seeking expansion. 

Based on data from the U.S. Statistical Abstract 
for  1977  to  1980,  growth  in  total  industry  sales 
was  calculated  by  dividing  the  regression  slope 
coefficient  by  the  mean  value  for  shipments 
(1977-80)  for  the  four-digit  SIC codes  for  the 
firm’s three  largest  lines  of  business;  these,  on 
average,  represent  76 percent of  the firm’s  total 
sales. 

Environmental instability 
Defined as the rate of  change in factors relevant 
to  strategic  decision-making  (Duncan,  1972), 
environmental  instability  depends  critically  on 
changes in the economic structure of  the industry; 
such  competitive  dynamics  represent  a  critical 
element of the environment (Sharfman and Dean, 
1991). We  thus  measure  instability  by  changes 
in the number and size of competitors within the 
industry.  This  conceptualization  and  oper- 
ationalization of  environmental instability differs 
from  previous  work,  in  that  Dess  and  Beard 
(1984) focused on instability in sales and employ- 
ment  growth,  and  Sharfman  and  Dean  (1991) 
measured  technological  instability.  We  chose  to 
focus on the competitive dynamics of  the industry 

Top Management Team  Turnover 

493 

because  it  is  a  broader  indicator  of  relevant 
aspects  of  instability  in  a  sample  of  firms  in 
which  each  firm operates in  multiple  industries. 
Further,  a  measure  of  technological  instability 
would  not  be  meaningful  in  a  sample  with 
multiple  industries  since  the 
importance  of 
technology varies widely across industries. 

One  of 

the  primary  elements  of 

industry 
structure  is  the  number  and  size distribution  of 
firms  within  the  industry  (Bain,  1968),  which 
economic  theory  suggests  is  linked  directly  to 
the vigor of  competition.  Industry concentration 
often  has been  viewed  as an  indicator  of  entry 
barriers  (Bain,  1%8),  and  empirical  evidence 
exists to support the relationship between industry 
concentration and firm profitability.  (See Weiss, 
1974, for a review.) The industry’s concentration 
ratio  (Sherer,  1980),  that  is,  the  percentage  of 
total  industry  sales  contributed  by  the  largest 
few  firms,  measures  this  element.  The  most 
common  variant  is  the  four-firm  sales  concen- 
tration  ratio  (the  percentage  of  total  industry 
sales  originated  by  the  leading  four  firms). 
Gathered  from  the  FTC  Line  of  Business  data 
base,  instability  was  measured  using  absolute 
changes in  the  four firm concentration  ratio  for 
each  business  in  the  firm’s portfolio,  weighted 
by that business’ relative sales revenue. 

Large absolute changes in the firm’s weighted 
concentration ratio  would  indicate  high  degrees 
of environmental instability. Changes in  industry 
concentration  reflect  shifts in  market  share due 
to new entrants, exits, consolidations, and erosion 
of  market  share, thus they  capture  the  dynamic 
nature  of  the firm’s industrial  environment. 

Environmental complexity 
For  large  multi-business  firms,  environmental 
complexity  can  best  be  conceptualized  by  the 
heterogeneity  of  activities pursued  by  the  firm, 
given a broad  array of  product-market  environ- 
ments.  We chose product complexity, or hetero- 
geneity,  as  the  best  reflection  of  the  greater 
information-processing requirements which large- 
ly define environmental complexity (Child,  1972; 
Dess and Beard,  1984). Dess and  Beard  (1984) 
point  out that firms in  industries which produce 
many different outputs or products, will find the 
disposal of  their output to be more complex due 
to  having  to interact  with  a  larger  number  and 
variety  of  firms.  Dess  and  Beard  (1984)  added 


494 

M .  F.  Wiersema and  K. A .  Bantel 

geographic concentration and input/output diver- 
sity  to  their  operationalization  and  found  only 
geographic concentration  to be  significant. Geo- 
graphic concentration  was not measured here  as 
it is unlikely t o  be a significant factor in a sample 
of 
large,  multinational  firms.  Sharfman  and 
Dean  (1991)  added  technical  intricacy  to  their 
conceptualization, but  it, too,  is not meaningful 
in  this multi-industry sample. 

Environmental complexity was measured using 
product  specialization ratios.  The primary prod- 
ucts  of  a  plant  are  those  which  determine  its 
industry  classification;  all  other  products  are 
referred  to as secondary products. The value of 
a plant’s primary products, in comparison to the 
value of  its total production, is referred to as its 
degree of  specialization; thus, high specialization 
suggests that  products  are  produced  exclusively 
for  the  industry  and  represents  homogeneity  of 
operating  requirements.  The specialization ratio 
for  each  line  of  business  (subtracted  from  one 
so  that  increasing  environmental  complexity  is 
indicated  by  larger  values  of  the  variable)  was 
multiplied by its relative firm sales and aggregated 
for each firm.  This results in a weighted average 
specialization  ratio  that  reflects  the  average 
complexity  (specialization)  faced  by  the  firm 
across its businesses. Industry specialization ratios 
at  the  four-digit  SIC  code  level  were  gathered 
from the  U.S. Census of  Manufacturers.

Validation of  the  environmental measures 
Following the  approach  of  Sharfman  and  Dean 
(1991),  we  examined  the  predictive  validity  of 
our environmental measures. We would expect all 
three environmental measures to be significantly 
correlated  with 
level  performance. 
Environments with high munificence in terms of 
sales  growth  should  provide  opportunity  for 
enhanced  industry  performance  (Porter,  1980); 
munificence  had  a  highly  significant  positive 
correlation of  0.309 with industry average profit- 
ability.  Environmental  instability should  have  a 
negative  correlation  as  changes  in 
industry 
structure 
rivalry  and 
decreased  industry  attractiveness  and  perform- 
ance (Porter,  1980); the: correlation was  -0.180, 
significant at the 0.05 level. A negative correlation 
is also expected for environmental complexity as 
greater information processing demands increase 
decision making difficulty and decrease efficiency 

indicate  competitive 

and  effectiveness;  a  significant  correlation  of 
-0.185  was found. 

Organizational performance 
Performance  was  measured  using  a  three-year 
average  of  the  firm’s  Return  on  Assets  (ROA) 
relative  to  the  industry  for  the  time  period 
1977-80.  ROA  is  one  of  the  most  commonly 
used accounting based performance  measures in 
the  strategy  literature.  This  measure  controlled 
for  industry  by  dividing  the  firm’s  three-year 
average ROA by the three-year average industry 
ROA. The  1977-80  time period  was selected as 
it  immediately  precedes  the  turnover  period 
being  studied.  All  data  on  firm  and  industry 
performance  were  gathered  from  the  COMPU- 
STAT data base. 

Strategic change 
Corporate  strategy  within  large,  multibusiness 
organizations reflects diversification decisions on 
the  mix  and  emphasis  of  businesses within  the 
corporate portfolio (Ansoff, 1965; Rumelt, 1974). 
Strategic  change  was  operationalized  by  using 
change in the firm’s diversification strategy from 
1977 to  1980.  Based  on  line  of  business  data 
from  TRINET,  the  diversification strategy  of  the 
organization  was  measured  using  the  entropy 
measure (Jacquemin and Berry, 1979), as follows. 
For a firm operating in N industry segments. Let 
Pi be  the  percentage  of  total  firm  sales  in  the 
ith segment. Then

Demographic heterogeneity 
Studies  investigating  the  effects  of  top  team 
demographic  heterogeneity  often  have  focused 
on the cohort-related traits of  age, organizational 
tenure, and team tenure for their theoretical  and 
empirical  importance.  As  these  measures  tend 
to be highly correlated, team tenure heterogeneity 
was  selected  as  the  most  relevant  to  team 
turnover. Fredrickson et al. (1988) point out that 
as a member’s tenure on the top team increases, 
a  closer  alignment  of  managerial  values  occurs 
between that individual and board members; the 
result  is  an  increase  in  power  and  influence for 


the team member. Heterogeneity on this variable 
suggests variations  in  power  across  team  mem- 
bers,  which could have a potentially detrimental 
and  destabilizing  effect  on  group  dynamics, 
leading to  turnover.  Furthermore,  greater  team 
tenure  heterogeneity  has been  shown to lead  to 
lower  levels  of  cohesiveness  and  integration 
within groups,  resulting in  a higher  incidence of 
turnover (O’Reilly et  al.,  1989). 

In addition, heterogeneity on education curricu- 
lum will  be examined. In contrast  with the team 
tenure  variable,  education  curriculum  measures 
a person’s cognition  more  directly:  a  manager’s 
personality,  cognitive  style,  and  training  are 
reflected  in  curriculum  choice  (Holland,  1973). 
Diversity in cognition in a decision-making group 
has been found to link with creative and change- 
oriented decision outcomes (Wanous and Youtz, 
1986; Wiersema  and  Bantel,  1992), yet  diverse 
viewpoints  can  create  strains  in  the  decision- 
making process  (Pfeffer,  1983). The selection of 
these  two  demographic heterogeneity  variables, 
reflecting  both  cohort  and  cognitive  issues, 
allows  a  broad  assessment  of  the  demographic 
heterogeneity  construct. 

The demographic heterogeneity variables were 
measured  for the  1980 period. The demographic 
heterogeneity  on  team  tenure  was  measured 
using  the  coefficient of  variation,  calculated  by 
dividing  the  standard  deviation  by  the  mean. 
Allison’s  (1979)  review  of  inequality  measures 
suggests  a  preference  for  the  coefficient  of 
variation because of  its scale invariant properties, 
as compared to the standard deviation or variance. 
For  the  categorical  variable,  education  curricu- 
lum,  Blau’s  (1977)  index  of  heterogeneity  was 
applied . 2   Education  curriculum  was  measured 
using  the  specialization  of  the  highest  obtained 
university  degree  (arts,  sciences,  engineering, 
business, and  law). 

Control variables 
Three  trait  demographic  variables-mean 
age, 
mean  organizational  tenure,  and  mean  team 
tenure-were 
also  considered  as  potential  con- 
trols. While there is theoretical rationale for the 

Top Management  Team Turnover 

495 

inclusion  of  all  three,  they  tend  to  be  highly 
correlated.  Mean  team  tenure  was  selected  for 
inclusion, consistent with our earlier decision on 
demographic heterogeneity. 

RESULTS 

Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, 
and correlations among the variables. Substantial 
correlations exist between top management team 
turnover  and  mean  team  tenure,  firm  perform- 
ance,  strategic  change,  environmental  munifi- 
cence,  environmental  instability,  and  environ- 
mental complexity. The correlations are positive, 
as  expected,  with  the  exception  of  mean  team 
tenure,  firm  performance,  and  environmental 
munificence. 

The data were analyzed using two steps. First, 
we used regression analyses to test for the effects 
of  each  of  the  independent  variables  on  team 
turnover.  Second, path  analysis was used to test 
the model illustrated in Figure 1. A path-analytic 
framework  is  the  appropriate  analytical method 
when  both  direct  and  indirect  influences  are 
hypothesized  (James,  Muliak  and  Brett,  1982) 
as shown in the model in  Figure  1. 

The  results  of 

the  hierarchical  regression 
analysis for  top  team  turnover  are  reported  in 
Table 2a. Following the causal model  set  out in 
Figure  1, we entered the control variable,  mean 
team tenure, first, followed by firm performance, 
strategic  change,  and  the  demographic  hetero- 
geneity  variables  (team  tenure  and  education 
curriculum).  Then  each  of  the  environmental 
variables,  munificence,  instability,  and  com- 
plexity, were  entered.3 

For  a  more  comprehensive  examination  of 
the  exact  relationships  identified  in  Figure  1, 
additional  empirical  investigation  using  path 
analysis  was  conducted.  Through  a  series  of 
multiple  regressions  of  each  variable  in  Figure 
1, path  analysis allows us  to examine  the  effect 
of  all preceding variables on team turnover. Path 
coefficients  were  derived  by  regressing  each 
variable  on  all  prior  variables  in  the  model.  In 
accordance  with  a  theory-trimming  approach  to 
path  analysis,  we  excluded  all  coefficients  not 

* Blau’s  index of  heterogeneity  is  calculated  as follows:  Let 
P, equal  the  proportion  of the  group’s individuals in  the ith 
category  (the  five  educational  curriculum  categories).  Then 
Blau  index of  heterogeneity  =  1 - C(P,)’. 

Additional measures of firm performance were also analyzed 
including  a ten-year time frame (197&198O),  which was both 
controlled  and  not  controlled for by  average industry ROA.

1982).  The  final  estimates  are  reported 
in 
Figure  2,  and  the  decomposition  of  the  causal 
relationships  is  shown  in  Table  3.  The  final 
model  explained  38  percent  of  the  variance  in 
top team turnover. 

As  shown  in  Figure  2  and  Table  3,  all  three 
environmental  variables  have  a  strong  direct 
effect on  top  team  turnover,  providing support 
for Hypotheses 1, 2,  and 3. In addition, strategic 
change  had  a  significant  effect  on  top  team 
turnover,  providing support  for  Hypothesis  5d. 
Support was also found for some of  the hypothe- 
sized  linkages  between  the  environmental  and 
mediating  variables.  Environmental  complexity 

was  negatively  related 
to  firm  performance 
(Hypothesis  4c).  Environmental  instability  had 
the expected significant positive relationship with 
strategic change (Hypothesis 5b). Environmental 
munificence  also  has  a  significant  positive 
relationship  with  strategic  change,  contrary  to 
our  expectation.  The  overall  results,  however, 
offer  little  support  for  the  indirect  linkages 
illustrated in Figure 1. Indirect effects of environ- 
mental  factors  through  firm  performance  were 
not  supported,  primarily  because  performance 
was  not  significantly  associated  with  turnover. 
Only  indirect  effects  of  environmental  munifi- 
cence  and  instability  through  strategic  change 
were  found.  The  decomposition  reported  in 
Table 3 indicates that 80 percent of  the effect of

In  light  of  the  asymmetric  distribution  of  the 
dependent variable, top team turnover, additional 
analyses were conducted to examine the robust- 
ness of  the model. The results of  these analyses 
basically confirm  that  strategic change,  environ- 
mental instability and complexity have significant 
effects on the incidence of  team  turnover. 

Additional analyses were conducted to examine 
top and second tier turnover  as shown in Table 
2b.  While  the overall  regression  results  proved 
to  be  significant,  the  model  explained  far  less 
variance when we examined turnover within the 
top and second tiers of  management separately. 
For the second tier, mean team tenure, strategic 
change,  and  environmental  complexity  contrib- 
uted  significantly  to  the  explained  variance  in 
team  turnover  (adjusted  RZ of  29%). For  the 
top tier, only strategic change and environmental 
instability  contributed

Top Management Team  Turnover 

499 

the  key  determinants of  turnover within the  top 
management  team  are  environmental-lack 
of 
munificence, instability, and complexity. Each of 
these  environmental  conditions  represents  a 
difficult  and  stressful  context  for  executive 
decision-making,  one  that  is  unlikely  to  be 
sustainable  for  a  long  period  of 
time.  Top 
managers  leave  their  firms  as  they  experience 
stress,  threats to their power,  outdated perspec- 
tives, conflicts, cost-cutting, and/or the desire for 
higher autonomy and challenge. 

Additional analysis by hierarchical level within 
the  team  indicates  that  our  model  predicts 
turnover  better  for  the  second  tier  than  for  the 
top tier. By the time managers attained positions 
in the top tier (Chairman, CEO, President, and/ 
or  COO),  they  are  likely  to  have  established 
more  entrenched  power  positions  and  to  have 
greater  symbolic  importance  as  figureheads, 
attributes  which  make  them  less  vulnerable  to 
losing their jobs as a  result  of  factors examined 
here.  Holding the second tier managers  directly 
accountable  for  poor  operating  results,  even  if 
some  scapegoating  occurs  as  a  result  (Boeker, 
1992), also occurs.  While  this  analysis is  useful 
in  helping  to  pinpoint  the  adaptation  dynamics 
for  two  subsegments of  the top team,  it  is  also 
important  to  note  that  the  best  explanation  of 
top team  turnover is based on an analysis of  the 
team  as  a  whole.  This  is  consistent  with  other 
studies that  demonstrate  that  an  analysis of  the 
entire  team  is  superior  to  one  based  solely  on 
the CEO in terms of  explained variance  (Bantel 
and Jackson,  1989; Finkelstein,  1988; Hage  and 
Dewar,  1973; Tushman ef al.,  1985). 

DISCUSSION 

This  research  was  based  on  an  organizational 
adaptation  framework  in  which  top  executives 
are  responsible  for  forging  a  link  between  the 
firm and its environment; such a role necessitates 
a good  alignment between  the  executives them- 
selves and  the  firm’s environmental  conditions. 
Consistent  with  this  framework,  we  found  that 

A more complex investigation of team turnover 
within  an  adaptation  viewpoint  requires  a  con- 
sideration  of  the  role  of  firm  performance  and 
strategic  change.  First, 
indirect  relationships 
between  the  environment and turnover  through 
performance  were  investigated.  Some  support 
for  the  link  between 
the  environment  and 
firm  performance  was  found:  environmental 
complexity was related to poor firm performance 
in  this  sample.  However,  the  lack  of  a  Iink 
between firm Derformance and turnover resulted 
in  no  confirmation  of  the 
linkage 
Additional analysis examined turnover for the top manage- 
ment  team  not  controlling  for  age.  The  result  of  the  full 
model depicted in  Table 2 was  an  adjusted R2 of  0.09, with  between  the  environment  and turnover  through 
significant  coefficients  for  mean  team  tenure  and  strategic  performance.  Our  lack  of 
findings  on  firm 
change, only. The  overall  model  was  significant at  the 0.10  performance is  consistent with Puffer and wein- 
level. 
Additional  analysis  examined  turnover  separately for  the 
CEO only. This analysis was not significant.

(1984)  study  and  attributable,  in  part,  to  our

inclusion of  environmental complexity; perform- 
ance was significant in our regression model until 
complexity  Mas  added.  This  points  out  the 
importance of  examining team turnover within an 
environmental  context.  Other  major  differences 
between  our  study  arid  that  of  Wagner  et  al. 
(1984)  are  our  measure  of  firm  performance 
(three-year average ROA controlling for industry 
ROA  versus  a ten-year  average  of  firm  ROA), 
our  use  of  an  elite  definition  of  the  top  team 
(mean  of  4.5,  range  from  2  to  8)  versus  an 
inclusive  definition  (range  from  5  to  41),  and 
our control for retirements. 

Our model also investigated the role of  strategic 
change,  based  on  the  theory  that  threatening 
environmental  conditions  can  be  managed 
through  changes in corporate  strategy that shifts 
the  environments  with  which  the  firm  interacts 
and  necessitates some  turnover  in  top  manage- 
ment.  While  strategic  change  had  a  significant 
relationship  with  team  turnover,  only  environ- 
mental instability had a significant indirect linkage 
with team turnover through strategic change, as 
predicted.  It appears that managers cope with an 
unstable environment  through strategic changes, 
that  may,  in  turn,  necessitate  some  turnover 
within the top team to improve the alignment of 
managers’ cognitions with the new environment. 
These findings extend  our  understanding  of  the 
link between strategic change and team turnover 
beyond  the  more  conventional  assumption  of 
turnover  bringing  fresh  perspectives  to 
the 
strategic  management  task,  leading  to  strategic 
change  (e.g.,  Tushman  and  Romanelli,  1985). 
This study denionstrates that the opposite causal 
relationship  can  occur,  particularly  at  the  level 
of  the  corporate strategy. 

Team  demographic  heterogeneity  was  also 
investigated as mediating the relationship between 
environmental complexity and turnover and was 
not supported; heterogeneity was not linked with 
either complexity or turnover.  It appears that  at 
the level of  the top management team, the issue 
of  demographic  diversity is  not  a  critical factor 
in an individual’s decision to remain on the team. 
This may be due largely to the nature of selection 
processes  to  management  positions  at  the  very 
top  echelons  of  elite  1J.S. corporations.  Strong 
norms  exist  within  such  firms  regarding  who  is 
promoted  to  the  top  levels,  with  sponsorship 
ensuring  their  inculcation  of  firm  values  and 
perspectives  and  their  ultimate  success.  The 

addition of  such managers to the executive team 
either  contributes  to  demographic  homogeneity 
or adds heterogeneity  that is not  dysfunctional. 
The  lack  of  findings  here  of  a  dysfunctional 
effect  of  team  heterogeneity  is  consistent  with 
Bantel  and Jackson  (1989), who found  that  age 
and  tenure  heterogeneity  neither  assisted  nor 
hindered  the  ability  of  bank  top  management 
teams  to  reach  consensus  on  and  implement 
innovations for their firms. Jackson et al. (1991) 
also  had  generally  consistent  results  in  their 
analyses of  elite subgroups (most comparable to 
our  definition of  the  top  team)  of  bank  holding 
companies.  With the exception of  heterogeneity 
on  college  alma  rnater,  none  of  their  other 
heterogeneity  variables  (age,  tenure,  education 
level,  education  curriculum,  experience  outside 
industry,  and  military  experience)  predicted 
turnover. 

An important methodological change was made 
in  this  study  compared  to  past  research.  This 
study  controlled  for the  effect of  age,  and  thus 
of  retirements,  on turnover;  none  of  the  other 
studies  on  team  turnover  (Jackson  et  al.,  1991; 
Wagner  et  al.,  1984; Walsh and Ellwood,  1991) 
did this. A lack of control for age makes it difficult 
to disentangle those influences on turnover that 
are  independent  of  an  individual’s  retirement 
decision.  When  age  was  not  controlled  for  in 
our  regression  model,  only  mean  team  tenure 
accounted for  a significant increase in  explained 
variance,  while  the  adjusted  R2  for  the  entire 
model  dropped  from  0.38  to  0.09 (see footnote 
4) * 
A  limitation  of  the  current  study  pertains  to 
the  time  periods  over which  our  analyses were 
conducted.  Our  model  examined  environmental 
and  firm  (performance,  strategic  change,  and 
demographic  heterogeneity)  predictors  of  turn- 
over that were all measured  over the same time 
period.  Perhaps new insights would be gained if 
a study were designed in which the relationships 
among predictors could be examined more closely 
by  postulating  a  causal  sequence  among  them. 
For example, environmental  predictors could be 
measured as causally prior to performance, which 
in  turn  could  precede  the  measure  of  strategic 
change.  This  approach  would  allow  a  disen- 
tangling of the causal sequencing of  these factors, 
enhancing our understanding  of  the dynamics of 
the process we have  examined  in  this study.  Of 
course,  researchers  would  need  to grapple  with 


the difficulties inherent in  longitudinal research, 
such as controlling for prior turnover. 

of  group  dynamics  would  also  appear  to  be 
warranted. 

Top Management  Team Turnover

Future research directions 
While  this  study  demonstrated  a  relationship 
between environmental influences and top execu- 
tive  turnover,  it  does  not  shed  much  light  on 
how 
the  environment  triggers  turnover  nor 
on  whose  responsibility  it  becomes  to  initiate 
executive  replacement.  Are  executives  leaving 
voluntarily to extricate themselves from situations 
that are stressful andor lacking in creativity and 
autonomy,  or  are  the  decisions  about  their 
leaving  being  made  for  them?  Do  managers 
proactively leave when it becomes apparent that 
industry performance is suffering yet before the 
effects are felt by  their firm, or are there better 
indicators of  performance that would show that 
poor  firm  performance  actually  does  precede 
turnover? What  is  the  role  of  the board in  the 
process of  initiating and selecting the removal of 
members from the top management team? 

Investigation could also focus on the  issue of 
congruence of  environmental perceptions across 
team  members.  As  individual  managers  seek 
to  specialize  in  their  respective  environmental 
subsegments, a  lack  of  congruence or  differen- 
tiation  across members might evolve; the impli- 
cations of  such lack of  consensus with regard to 
both  dysfunctional group process  and  turnover 
could be examined. 

Finally,  a  potentially  important  variable  in 
understanding  team  turnover  is  the  interaction 
patterns among members, specifidy, interaction 
frequency and intensity. For the highly differen- 
tiated teams that evolve in  response to environ- 
mental complexity, interactions among members 
can  be  difficult and  stressful.  If  team  members 
meet frequently, the effects of  high differentiation 
might be mitigated as more thorough information 
processing and better conflict resolution occurs. 
On  the  other  hand,  high  interaction  might 
highlight the incompatibilities among team mem- 
bers,  exacerbating  the  dysfunctional  effects. 
Interaction patterns could be ascertained through 
observation or questionnaire. 

This study should provide further  encourage- 
ment  to  researchers  to  focus  on  the  effects 
of  environmental  factors  on  various  facets  of 
organizational adaptation. Further studies exam- 
ining  top  team  turnover  from  the  standpoint
