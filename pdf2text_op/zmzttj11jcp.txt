Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) form the core of societal and economic development.
However, most people query on the implementation and performance of environmental management. In
this paper, the manufacturing SMEs in Northern China with different pollution levels are studied to
explore the main forces (e.g., government, society, market, and enterprise itself) driving SMEs for
promoting environmental management. It focuses on the correlation between environmental manage-
ment and economic performance for SMEs at different pollution levels. The results show that SMEs of
different pollution levels have signiﬁcant differences in the relationship of driving forces and perfor-
mance. First, for SMEs with high-pollution levels, social and market driving forces and government
incentives are revealed having a signiﬁcant effect on their environmental performance. Driving forces
from within the enterprise itself and the market provide a positive effect on the economic performance,
while social forces have a negative effect. Second, for SMEs with light pollution, social and market driving
forces, and government assistance play a supporting role on corporate environmental performance
improvement. It is also found that the driving force of the enterprise itself does not have a signiﬁcant
effect on the environmental performance for SMEs with different pollution levels. In addition, the
environmental performance and economic performance for SMEs with high or light-pollution levels are
positively correlated. Further, it shows that the environmental performance is moderately correlated
with ﬁnancial indices, but not signiﬁcantly with the non-ﬁnancial indices.

1. Introduction

The trend of stricter international regulations, conventions for
environmental protection, and the rise of consumer environmen-
talism impose great challenges to enterprises (Chen et al., 2006),
especially for the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
(Peres and Stumpo, 2000). Because of some endogenous and
exogenous reasons, the performance of environmental manage-
ment of SMEs is still not satisfactory, and serious pollution acci-
dents have been recorded from time to time (Shi et al., 2008;
Cordano et al., 2010), which seriously damaged the natural envi-
ronment and aroused safety hazards due to pollution generated as
a consequence of companies’ operations, leading to environmental
accidents such as excess emissions of waste water, gas or other solid
waste pollutants.

In China, according to the latest law on promotion of small- and
medium-sized enterprises in 2003, manufacturing SMEs1 are
deﬁned as those with fewer than 2000 employees, an annual
turnover of less than or equal to RMB Yuan 300 million, or a total
asset of less than or equal to RMB Yuan 400 million (Zeng et al.,
2010b). SMEs accounted for more than 90% of the total number
of manufacturing establishments in China in 2010, and they
contribute signiﬁcantly to social and economic development.
However, SMEs has created signiﬁcant negative environmental
impacts, which may harm neighboring residents’ health due to

1 According to the law of SMEs promotion in China in 2003, the characteristics of
the number of employees, the annual revenues and total assets are used as criteria
to deﬁne SMEs. For the manufacturing industry, SME is deﬁned as either less than
2000 employees, an annual turnover of no more than RMB Yuan 300 million, or
a total asset of no more than RMB Yuan 400 million. While medium-sized enter-
prises are deﬁned as those having more than 300 employees, an annual turnover of
more than RMB Yuan 30 million, and a total asset of more than RMB Yuan
40 million, others are deﬁned as small businesses.

obsolete equipment, inexperienced labor, or insufﬁcient ﬁnancial
resources, especially in the most energy-intensive and polluting
industries in China (Diao et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2008). It was re-
ported by China Environmental Protection Administration that
there are 40e50 percent of environmental pollution brought about
by SMEs in China, and among the 30 million SMEs, 80 percent of
them produced environmental pollution (Zhou, 2005).

There are increasing pressures on Chinese ﬁrms from a number
of different sources, such as governmental regulations, community
participation and market demand, to ask for environmental
initiatives in China, among which, larger sized ﬁrms are more active
(Zhang et al., 2008). For the Chinese SMEs, however, the underlying
barriers to adoption of cleaner production include the lack of
economic incentive policies, lax environmental enforcement, and
high initial capital cost (Shi et al., 2008). Therefore, owing to the
lack of effective corporate environmental management systems
and incentive mechanism, it is difﬁcult to overcome the adverse
effects of unreasonable utilization of resources and insufﬁcient
adoption of environment-friendly technologies (Zeng et al., 2005).
Most of the previous studies show that the scale of enterprises is
positively correlated to their environmental management capac-
ities as larger sized enterprises can easily get access to resources
(Jesus and Junquera, 2003; Zeng et al., 2010a) and external support
(Darnall and Edwards, 2006). SMEs, however, exhibit some passive
environmental management behavior in dealing with environ-
mental laws and regulations, which may be resulted from the lack
of effective driving forces (Zeng et al., 2005), that is, the lack of
effective pressures or forces that drive ﬁrms to promote environ-
mental management.

There is, to our knowledge, a paucity of studies in exploring
impacts of driving forces of environmental management on the
environmental and the economic performance of SMEs (Liu et al.,
2010). In this paper, a survey is conducted, aiming to explore how
the driving forces (i.e., from the government, society, market and
enterprise itself) of environmental management affect environ-
mental and economic performances of SMEs of different levels of
pollution (i.e., light and high). This study aims to provide answers to
the following questions:

 How environmental management driving forces affect corpo-
rate environmental and economic performances of SMEs?
 What is the relation of different pollution levels to environ-
mental performance and economic performance of SMEs?
 For different pollution levels of SMEs, what is the correlation of
environmental performance and economic performance?

2. Previous works

2.1. Driving forces on environmental management

Driving forces, pushing enterprises to implement environ-
mental management, are divided into two types: internal and
external (Montiel and Husted, 2010; Qi et al., 2010).

2.1.1.

Internal driving forces

Internal driving forces are resulted from company’s internal
motivation (enterprise itself), such as internationalization of
seeking to enter the international market (King and Lenox, 2001),
reputation of the enterprise (Bansal and Hunter, 2003), valuing
systems of management (Egri and Herman, 2000), and the corpo-
rate environmental responsibility for employees’ health (Roome
and Wijen, 2006). These forces work because environmental
pollution prevention can provide a better performance to enter-
prises (King and Lenox, 2000).

Enterprises will actively adopt the strategies of implementing
environmental management when gaining competitive advantages
(Aragon-Correa et al., 2008); for example, clean production tech-
nologies (Zeng et al., 2010c), product re-design, change of production
process, improvement of resource utilization (Ramus and Steger,
2000), and reduction of production cost can build up company’s
competitive advantages (Sharma, 2000).

2.1.2. external driving forces

Driving forces coming from externalities (Delmas, 2002) are
very important
in promoting environmental management of
enterprises (Branzei et al., 2004; Moffat and Auer, 2006). They can
be divided into three aspects: the government driving force (Zeng
et al., 2003), the market driving force and the social driving force
(Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006).

Enterprises, barely meeting the requirements of mandatory
government environmental regulations, can escape from environ-
mental punishment. Thus, it is well acknowledged the importance
of government environmental regulations for guiding corporate
environmental management. To avoid environmental penalties,
ﬁnes and violation costs, enterprises must comply with these
environmental regulations.

The market driving force includes two aspects: competitors’ and
buyers’ requirements (Shrivastava, 1995). For example, enterprises
can improve market competitiveness after implementing envi-
ronmental management by reducing manufacturing waste (Zeng
et al., 2008).

The social driving forces including those from public media and
certain industrial associations are also important as enterprises’
commitment to eco-responsibility can help them gain social
reputation (Hart, 1995).

2.2. Corporate environmental and economic performance

The relationship between corporate environmental and
economic performances has always been the core issue of envi-
ronmental management research (Menguc et al., 2010; Russo and
Fouts, 1997). However, previous studies give mixed results. Busi-
ness performance can be measured in terms of the gross proﬁt
margin, market share, sales per capita, etc. (Henri and Journeault,
2008; Naveh and Marcus, 2005).

Porter and van der Linde (1995) addressed that environmental
regulations could improve the competitiveness of enterprises;
therefore, the environmental and economic performances were
positively related as conﬁrmed by other researchers (Hart, 1995;
Klassen and Whybark, 1999; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and
Vredenburg, 1998). However, this has faced some challenges.
Some research identiﬁed that the relationship between corporate
environmental and economic performances was not signiﬁcant,
some even with negative correlation because implementing envi-
ronmental management needs to invest extra resources, including
funds, technologies and human resources, leading to extra costs.
Therefore, environmental management may extrude other poten-
tial investments and reduce the corporate sustainable competition
(Sarkis and Dijkshoorn, 2007; Wagner, 2008).

In fact, the relationship between environment management
and corporate performance may be more complex. Adoption of
cutting-edge technology costs more and good environmental
performance can reduce corporate proﬁts, and thus the environ-
mental and economic performances could have an inverse relation-
ship. However, some studies (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998; Buysse
and Verbeke, 2003) show that improvement in environmental
performance is a potential competitive advantage (e.g., new tech-
nologies to cost reduction, innovative products, and attracting more
in
environment-friendly consumers). Therefore,

improvement

environment management and competitiveness of enterprises are
not in conﬂict (Lee et al., 2006; Andersson and Bateman, 2000).
Adopting proactive environmental management including environ-
mental auditing programs and management systems has been found
to be associated with strong ﬁnancial performance (Darnall et al.,
2010). Waddock and Smith (2000) conducted a case study with
a description of how an internal environmental audit led to improved
waste reduction practices, increased plant capacity, and signiﬁcant
cost savings. Adopting environmental management systems which
exceed legal requirements could decrease enterprises’ toxic emis-
sions levels and realize lower capital costs (Feldman et al., 1997;
Sharfman and Fernando, 2008). Progressive
environmental
management also leads to opportunities to work with external
environmental stakeholder groups, and to take part in high-proﬁle
environmental programs from government
(Miles and Covin,
2000). As a result, enlightened environmental management can
improve ﬁnancial and reputational competitive advantages (Petrick
et al., 1999). Murphy (2002) made a good summary of twenty
leading empirical studies on the correlation of environmental/
ﬁnancial performances and found that positive environmental
performance is linked with positive ﬁnancial results, indicating that
the conventional ‘cost’ view is outdated in some sense. In a long-term
perspective, corporate environmental management and competi-
tiveness could be a “winewin” relationship (Juan and Enrique, 2007;
Porter and van der Linde,1995; Shrivastava,1995; Christmann, 2000).

3. Model development and hypotheses

3.1. A conceptual model

According to the literature review, the driving forces for envi-
ronmental management of Chinese SME can be categorized into
four dimensions: government, market, society, and enterprise. The
performance is decomposed into environmental performance and
business performance.

A conceptual model of driving forces on environmental

management performance is developed as shown in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 1, the environmental performance is measured in terms of
contamination control and contamination prevention. Contamination

control includes reducing contamination release, energy consump-
tion, and selecting suppliers with good environmental protection
records (Lopez-Gamero and Molina-Azorln, 2009). Contamination
prevention is a long-term measure, which includes carrying out ISO
14001, cleaner production activities, staff training, and environmental
audit. Economic performance can directly be reﬂected by ﬁnancial
and non-ﬁnancial indices. Financial indices refer to sales, proﬁtability,
inventory turnover, and ROE while non-ﬁnancial indices refer to
market share, sale region, and the number of customers (Earnhart and
Lizal, 2010).

As for external and internal driving forces in Fig. 1, the driving
force from the government includes government incentives, regu-
lations, and assistance. Government incentive is the major moti-
vation for SME, for instance, in terms of tax reduction and subsidy,
etc. (Zeng et al., 2003). The government can reward environment-
friendly SMEs according to China’s Cleaner Production Promotion
Law, and SME Promotion Law in 2003, which applies to all regions
of China supporting SMEs with tax reduction and subsidy, venture
capital and investment guarantees or other ﬁnancial support, and
opportunities to the undertake Government’s environmental
projects. Government regulations mean that when enterprises
violate the law or fail in achieving the standard, the government
would compel enterprises to follow by imposing a penalty, even
stopping their businesses. Government assistance is deﬁned as
assistance in the forms of technologies, information about envi-
ronmental protection, project ﬁnance, and other supports for
corporate environmental green products and technologies.

Market driving forces include two aspects: competitors’ and
buyers’ requirements. The driving force of competitors refers to
environmental protection practices and the related pressure
brought about by competitors of the same industry. Buyers’
requirements are the forces imposed by purchasers or customers. If
production of the ﬁnal products (such as food, medicine, textile,
paper, etc.) is closer to consumers, businesses may feel more
pressure. When an enterprise can improve its reputation, it would
be more motivated to adopt environmental management.

Society driving forces are composed of many elements:
community requirements, environmental associations, and media
exposure. Community requirements are made up of suggestions

from the community and complaints about environmental prob-
lems. Environmental associations are the social association, calling
for protecting the environment, and imposing their requirements
on enterprises. Media exposure is the exposure of various media,
such as television, broadcasting companies, newspapers and online
media. Currently, once a company is exposed by the public media,
local governments would be subject to the pressure from the public
and the higher-level government may impose severe penalties on
the companies.

To better achieve the strategic objectives (i.e., proﬁtability and
market expansion), enterprises can be motivated to implement
environmental management. Financial goals consist of sales, prof-
itability, and return on equity (ROE). The expansion of market share
and number of customers are the representative indices for market
expansion. Because of the close relationship between ﬁnancial
promotion and market expansion, the programs or planning for the
above aspects will form a combined index for measuring the
enterprises’ driving force.

3.2. Hypotheses development

To study the driving forces for SMEs’ environmental manage-
ment, enterprises are divided into high and light-pollution accord-
ing to their contamination levels. High-pollution enterprises are
deﬁned as those causing severe contamination to the environment,
while the light-pollution ones causing less severe pollution.

3.2.1. Driving forces and environmental performance

The relationship between environmental performance and the
four driving forces (government, society, market and enterprises)
will be discussed below, and hypotheses will be developed
accordingly.

Increasingly strict regulations of

the government are the
primary motivation to drive enterprises to improve their environ-
mental performance. The mandatory rules cause enterprises
participating in voluntary environmental activities in order to
achieving standards beyond the requirement of these strict rules
(Segerson and Miceli, 1998).
In addition, the lower cost for
consumers and the government accessing enterprises’ information
can induce a greater power to drive enterprises to voluntarily
reduce contamination for the sake of their reputation (Segerson
and Miceli, 1998).

enterprises

The adoption of environmental management system for enter-
prises is related to the community commitment to the relevant
stakeholders (Florida and Davison, 2001). Enterprises would
signiﬁcantly reduce toxic emission, which could attract attention of
a lot of environmental interest groups (Maxwell and Decker, 2006).
Market pressure is one of the factors affecting enterprises’
environmental performance. Some research explain the internal
motivation of
in implementing environmental
from different perspectives, e.g., organizational
management
structure (Ramus and Steger, 2000), organizational
learning
(Marcus and Nichols, 1999), values of leadership (Egri and Herman,
2000), and attitudes of managers toward the environment
(Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Sharma, 2000). Based on the cost-proﬁt
theory of economics, managers make decisions either regarding the
relevant costs, risks and beneﬁts, or focusing on enterprises’
competitive advantage, i.e., improving corporate image through
proactive environmental strategy, green differentiation strategy to
expand market share (Branzei et al., 2004; Chen et al. 2006).

From previous studies, it is noted that the force imposed by the
government on enterprises is thought to be the most conspicuous
driving factor, especially in the forms of incentives and regulations
on SMEs. However, the government’s effort on SMEs has led to
unsatisfactory results as the driving force of government on SMEs

mainly relies on regulations in the recent decade in China. It thus
leads to the questions of whether the government’s incentive
schemes and regulations would still bring better results and
whether the current social pressure, market competition and
internal enterprise driving forces could lead to better environ-
mental performance. Hence, it is proposed for SMEs at different
contamination level that:

H1a. Levels of the government driving force positively inﬂuence
the environmental performance of SMEs.
H1b. Levels of society driving force are positively associated with
the environmental performance of SMEs.
H1c. Levels of market driving force are positively associated with
the environmental performance of SMEs.
H1d. Levels of enterprise driving force are positively associated
with the environmental performance of SMEs.

3.2.2. Driving forces and economic performance

suggest

that government

regulations,
market and social pressure, corporate proactive environmental
strategies impel corporate environmental management practices,
i.e., adopting new environmental practices to reduce pollution
source, more environmentally friendly ways of operation, etc.,
which can reduce waste disposal costs, and penalty, bringing about
effective economic beneﬁts for enterprises (Aragon-Correa et al.,
2008; Delmas, 2002; Moffat and Auer, 2006).

Internationalization is the key factor for enterprises to introduce
environmental management systems widely (Zeng et al., 2003),
which indicates that international environmental regulations and
consideration for market expansion could model enterprises’
behavior and thus affect their economic performance. Zeng et al.
(2003) concluded that the most important driving force for
Chinese construction enterprises was “seeking to enter the inter-
national construction market”.

Green consumption of the market contributes to new cleaner
products and contamination reduction. Green preference of the
market could make enterprises to win the market and improve
economic performance by product differentiation (Cordano et al.,
2010).

For enterprises, implementation of integrated environmental
management can lower the business risk from the environmental
perspective, and thus they can be easier to get insurance and
commercial loan. Environmental crises also have a negative impact
on businesses (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996), which would be
reﬂected from the abnormal negative return in the stock market.
In general, the driving force of government has a signiﬁcant
effect on SMEs’ economic performance, because the positive ways
(such as tax reduction and subsidy) and the negative ways (like
penalty and shutdown for reformation) could greatly inﬂuence
enterprises’ economic performance. Nevertheless, some managers
of SMEs and environment consultants, whom we interviewed,
generally accepted that neither government’s incentives and
regulations, nor government’s assistance have conspicuous effects
on the economic performance of SMEs. Thus, it leads to the ques-
tion on whether government’s incentives have enough attraction to
SMEs, and the regulations could powerfully stimulate them, and
the government’s assistance could also achieve the expected
results. The market competition and social pressure, and the
enterprise itself
(e.g., competition with differentiation, and
consideration for lower ﬁnancing costs) may have a signiﬁcant
impact on the economic performance. However, there exists
inadequate investigation toward the driving forces on the economic
performance of SMEs at different contamination levels. Hence, for
the SMEs, the following hypotheses are proposed:


1430

S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437

H2a: Government’s driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the
economic performance of SMEs.
H2b: Society driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the economic
performance of SMEs.
H2c: Market driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the economic
performance of SMEs.
H2d: Enterprise driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the
economic performance of SMEs.

3.2.3. Environmental and economic performance

The results of studies on corporate environmental performance

and economic performance are controversial.

(2007)

Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) found that environmental
management and economic performance have a positive correla-
tion. Montabon et al.
revealed that environmental
management was positively correlated to economic performance.
Proactive environmental management could lead to better perfor-
mance (Claver et al., 2007), of which enterprises were more inclined
to take proactive environmental management with a precautionary
combination of environmental control technology. However, some
researchers argue that there lacks a correlation or even exhibits
a negative correlation. Sarkis and Dijkshoorn (2007) found that
when the environmental performance was improved, the economic
performance had not improved signiﬁcantly. Sarkis (2006) revealed
that additional investments on the environment in a project at the
early stage might be unable to provide better economic perfor-
mance within a short period of time. Link and Naveh (2006)
addressed that implementation of an environmental management
system was unassociated with business performance.

In fact, enterprises of different contamination levels will have
different costs and beneﬁts resulted from improving the environ-
mental performance (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998; Juan and
Enrique, 2007). Hence, it is proposed:

H3a: For SMEs with high-pollution level: environmental perfor-
mance is positively associated with their economic performance.
H3b: For SMEs with light-pollution level: environmental
performance is positively associated with their economic
performance.
H3c: For SMEs of the two pollution levels: high-pollution and
light-pollution enterprises, the relationship between environ-
mental performance and economic performance is different.

4. Research Methodology

4.1. Measurement

4.1.1. Dependent variable

The dependent variable is enterprises’ performance. The enter-
prises’ performance is measured by two aspects: environmental
and economic performance.

Environmental performance consists of short-term contami-
nation control measures and long-term contamination preventions.
Contamination control is measured by three indices: reduction in
contamination release, energy consumption,
and selecting
suppliers with good environmental protection records. Contami-
nation prevention has four components: carrying out ISO 14001
environmental management system, conducting cleaner produc-
tion activities, staff training, and environmental auditing.

Economic performance comprises ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial
indices. The ﬁnancial index is surveyed in a form of sales, proﬁt-
ability, inventory turnover, and ROE while the non-ﬁnancial index
is measured by market shares, sale region, and the number of
customers.

4.1.2.

Independent variables

Independent variables are the government’s driving forces,
society driving forces, market driving forces, and enterprises’
driving forces.

Government’s driving forces are divided into three dimensions:
incentives,
regulations, and government’s assistance. Market
driving forces include competitors’ and buyers’ requirements.
Society driving forces include community requirements, environ-
mental associations, and media exposure. Enterprise driving forces
are represented by ﬁve indices: overall planning for sales, overall
planning for proﬁtability, overall planning for ROE, overall planning
for market share expansion, and overall planning for the increase in
the number of customers.

4.1.3. Control variables

To avoid the relationship between driving forces and enter-
prises’ performance inﬂuenced by total assets, past sales, the
number of employees, and ages of SMEs, they are set as control
variables.

Multiple regression analysis and factor analysis are used to
study the relationship. In this study, software programs SPSS 15.0 is
used.

4.2. Survey

In this paper, classiﬁcation of SMEs is based on the industry-
category standard declared by the National Statistical Bureau of
China. SMEs are classiﬁed into high-pollution and light-pollution
enterprises for contrast and analysis. High-pollution enterprises
with waste water or gas or other solid waste pollutants (e.g., sulfur
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, coal dust, mineral oils, cyanide, mercury
and arsenic) seriously damaging the natural environment and
arousing safety hazards. In 2008, China’s State Environmental
Protection Administration announced the ﬁrst group of “high
pollution, high environmental risk” products directory, involving
a total of 141 categories of products, mainly related to pesticides,
batteries, dyes, inorganic salt, paints, organic arsenic, etc. However,
there still lacks comprehensive, authoritative and accurate criteria
for classifying the level of high-pollution enterprises. In fact, high-
pollution enterprises are often identiﬁed by the fact of whether
a company falls into a high-pollution industry. China’s State Envi-
ronmental Protection Administration issued a regulation on envi-
ronmental protection veriﬁcation in 2007 and a guidance on Green
Security in 2008, which provisionally identiﬁed 13 kinds of high-
pollution industries (i.e., metallurgical, chemical, petrochemical,
coal, thermal power, building materials, paper making, brewing,
pharmaceutical, fermentation, textile, leather and mining), and has
imposed strict monitoring on enterprises falling into these high-
pollution industries since 2008. Based on the guidance issued by
China’s State Environmental Protection Administration in 2008,
high-pollution enterprises fall into one of the ﬁve sectors: medicine
and chemistry, printing and dyeing or leather-production, metal-
lurgical, materials production for building and cement industry, oil
reﬁning and cooking industries (Zeng et al., 2010b). While light-
pollution enterprises are one of the following ﬁve: agricultural
byproduct, weaving and cloth, machinery manufacturing, hard-
ware machining, and electronic component industries.

The survey was conducted in the Northern China district
(including Beijing, Tianjing, and Hebei Province), named as the
Bohai Bay economic circle. Northern China is facing serious envi-
ronmental problems where there is serious pollution from SMEs.
The survey was pre-tested by thirty environmental experts and
consultants and revised according to their comments. In 2009,
surveys were sent to managers or individuals who worked in
the ﬁrm’s
manufacturing SMEs and were responsible for

1431

environmental activities. The manufacturing sector was selected
because it produces more air, land, and water pollution than the
service sector in China. Respondents were identiﬁed from public
database; for instance, the Hebei province population was iden-
tiﬁed using data from the directory of SMEs from the Small- and
medium-sized Business Administration. From a total of 116,000
manufacturing SMEs in these three provinces, we randomly
selected 500 SMEs. Five hundred questionnaires were sent with
137 received. The response rate was 27.4%, which is consistent
with previous studies of organizations’ environmental practices
(e.g., Christmann, 2000; Darnall et al., 2010). One hundred and
four valid questionnaires were used for analysis, including 39
high-pollution SMEs and 65 light-pollution SMEs. Among the
three investigating ways of mailing, direct visiting and telephone,
the rate of e-mail feedback questionnaire is low. The reasons of the
invalid questionnaires are that the characteristics of enterprises
(e.g., number of employees or the annual revenues) were beyond
the deﬁnition of SMEs, and those export-oriented enterprises with
a proportion of export value of more than 20% of their total
turnover had been subjected to great inﬂuence due to the ﬁnancial
crisis in 2008, and those with incomplete information in the
questionnaires. In this study, a ﬁve-point scale is used to assess the
enterprises’ response to the driving forces, environmental and
economic performances.

5. Results and analysis

5.1. Reliability and validity

5.1.1. Reliability analysis

In this paper, Cronbach Alpha coefﬁcient (a coefﬁcient) is used
for checking the internal consistency of items, which is a widely
accepted reliability test. Reliability refers to the characteristics of the
measurement results with consistency and stability. The higher the
reliability of measurement, the more stable and reliable measure-
ment results will be. However, the acceptable value of Cronbach
a coefﬁcient lacks a uniﬁed standard. It is usually considered that
the coefﬁcient of reliability falling into the range of 0.6e0.8 is
enough. In practice, it is good when the value of consistency coef-
ﬁcient is above 0.7 (Peter, 1979). By running the modules of reli-
ability analysis in SPSS 15.0, a value of Cronbach a coefﬁcient for
every item of driving forces and performance is obtained. Table 1
tabulates the Cronbach a coefﬁcients for measuring each dimen-
sion of driving forces and performance.

The values of a coefﬁcient in both driving forces and perfor-
mance are larger than 0.6, with the exception of the market forces
of high-pollution enterprises and contamination control of light-
in where the Cronbach a coefﬁcient is
pollution enterprises,
comparatively low.

5.1.2. Validity analysis

As the indicators of driving forces and the performance are
based on the existing research results, the content validity of the
indicators is satisfactory.

In this paper, conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) is employed to
test the construct validity. Common factors are calculated by the
way of Varimax rotation. Before factor analysis, the relativity
among items using methods of KMO sample test and Bartlett
sphericity test is used to ﬁnd out whether it is suitable to use factor
analysis. The results of tests suggest that it is proper to carry out the
CFA. From the correlation matrix of the observable items, “% of
variance explained” of the ﬁrst factor, is collected (see Table 2).

Both for the high- and light-pollution SMEs, the driving forces
of government, market, and enterprise, are able to extract the ﬁrst

factor with a high degree of explanation.

a Each dimension of Driving Forces, Environmental Performance, and Economic
Performance calculates Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient for light and high-pollution enter-
prises respectively.

b Because of the small scale nature of SMEs and underground occurrence of
contamination, choices for the “Environmental Associations” and “Media Exposure”
are usually ﬁlled with “None” under the society driving forces. Therefore, these two
aspects affect Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient for measuring the society driving forces and
the values of CITC (Corrected ItemeTotal Correlation) are less than 0.3. It is clear that
there is obvious difference in the values of Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient after the item is
deleted. So the items of “Environmental Associations” and “Media Exposure” are
eliminated, the social driving forces only include community requirements, which
stands for the driving forces of Society. As there is only one indicator left, it does not
need reliability testing.

c Taking reliability test and principal component analysis into consideration, we
can ﬁnd that the CITC for the item “inventory turnover” of ﬁnancial indices is less
than 0.3. If the item for measure is removed, the Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient would rise.
Therefore, the ﬁnancial performance is measured using the remaining items of Sales,
Proﬁtability and ROE. After removal, it shows a much greater internal consistency of
the three items.

contamination control and contamination prevention, and ﬁnancial
and non-ﬁnancial indices, are also able to ﬁnd a factor with high
degree variance explanation.

In the following multiple regression analysis, the score of the
ﬁrst factor can be regarded as the value of the composite indicator,
and then as control variables which are used to analyze the speciﬁc
impact of other driving forces on performance. Since there is no “%
of variance” of each factor reaching 85% or more, there is no severe
violation of multicollinearity among similar indices in any one
construct.

a As the social driving forces only include the item of “community requirement”,

factor analysis is not needed as well.

b The ﬁnancial indices analyzed by factor analysis include Sales, Proﬁtability and

5.2. Results and analysis

5.2.1. Driving forces on environmental performance
5.2.1.1. Relationship between driving forces and contamination con-
trol. The number of employees, past sales, total assets and ﬁrm ages
are set as the control variables. Multiple regression analysis is used
and the dependent variable is contamination control in this part.
For the independent variables, the driving forces of government,
market, society, and enterprise itself are used respectively; for
example, the driving forces of government is focused ﬁrst, that is,
the impact of government incentives, government regulations and
government assistance on contamination control. The integrated
factor score of the other three driving forces then serves as the
control variable. By controlling the three driving forces, the rela-
tionship between contamination control and the government
driving forces is analyzed. Similarly, other driving forces are
analyzed. The results are shown in Table 3.

For different pollution levels of SMEs, the effects of government
and market driving forces on contamination control are different.
For high-pollution enterprises, government
incentives have
obvious effects. But for the light-pollution enterprises, government
assistances play a more important role. Government regulations to
enterprises of the two contamination levels have no discernible
effect. For high-pollution enterprises, competitors of the market
driving force have evidential
inﬂuence. While for the light-
pollution enterprises, buyers’ requirements can drive enterprises
to improve the levels of contamination control. For the two types
of SMEs, social driving forces have positive inﬂuences on

enhancement of contamination control, while enterprises’ driving
forces have no signiﬁcant effects in improving the contamination
control.

5.2.1.2. Relationship between driving forces and contamination pre-
vention. From the regression results of high-pollution enterprises
(see Table 4), only the driving force of the market has a signiﬁcantly
positive impact on SMEs in upgrading the level of pollution
prevention at p < 0.05 level. However, government driving forces,
social driving forces and enterprise driving forces do not show
signiﬁcantly positive roles. As for the government driving forces,
only the government incentive is signiﬁcant at a level of 0.10.

Regression results of light-pollution enterprises also show that
only the market driving force has a signiﬁcantly positive inﬂuence
on the environment performance in contamination prevention.
Further, the inﬂuence of the market driving force for the two types
of SMEs mainly comes from competitors’ pressure instead of
buyers’ requirements.

As shown in Tables 3 and 4, with an increasing awareness of
environmental protection, social driving forces have become
stronger for SMEs, and the government can play a signiﬁcant role,
and the effect of market is stronger. Whether for light- or high-
pollution SMEs, government, market and society are three impor-
tant driving forces, which support hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c. It is
clear that the contamination control, traditionally under the
governmental regulations,
is transiting to be driven by the
government, market and community. However, enterprises’ driving
forces for SMEs at different pollution levels do not motivate SMEs to

The dependent variable of the model Ma1 and Ma2 is Contamination Control (CC). The independent variables, we focused on, are the government driving forces. Then, the
impact of government incentives, government regulations and government assistance on contamination control is studied. The ﬁrst factor of the other three driving forces was
treated as the control variable. Similarly, for model Mb1 and Mb2, the market driving forces are treated as the independent variables. Meanwhile, the impact of competitors’ and
buyers’ requirements on contamination control is explored. For the model Mc1 and Mc2, the independent variable is the enterprise driving force. Then, the inﬂuences are
analyzed respectively for the strength of planning for Sales, Proﬁtability, ROE, market share and number of customers on contamination control. The integrated factor score of
the other three driving forces serves as the control variables.

signiﬁcantly improve their environment performance in contami-
nation control. Thus, hypothesis 1d is not supported.

For

the short-term contamination control,

inﬂuence of
community requirements for high-pollution and light-pollution
enterprises is almost the same, while there is a difference
between the market and government driving forces.

these SMEs. Therefore,

Owing to the low degree of attention to light-pollution enter-
prises, competitors give little effect on the environmental protec-
tion of
competitors’ pressure on
contamination control of light-pollution enterprises is low. On the
contrary, high-pollution enterprises are strictly supervised by the
environmental protection departments, which lead to high level of
environmental protection in the industry. To survive, high-
pollution enterprises need to practice contamination control pro-
actively under the high competitors’ pressure.

Considering the driving force of government, most SMEs are
township-run enterprises, and there exist difﬁculties in supervision
and create problems of local protectionism. So high-pollution
enterprises are motivated to control and prevent contamination by
the government incentives. Nevertheless, the government super-
vision cannot give them sufﬁcient pressure. Considering light-
pollution enterprises, they do not make much pollution and the
impacts of government incentives and regulations for them are
very low, while government assistances can promote pollution
control and prevention. Government incentives can bring better
results than government regulations on environmental manage-
ment of SMEs for the high-pollution enterprises. However, for light-
pollution enterprises, government incentives and regulations have
no better effect than the government assistance.

For

the long-term pollution prevention, pressure from
competitors in the market has a certain degree of inﬂuence on

light-pollution enterprises in enhancing contamination prevention.
However, competitors of
light-pollution enterprises are not
enthusiastic about the overall industrial environment. Therefore,
in-depth studies on how to protect the environment for light-
pollution enterprises are needed in the future. For the high-
pollution enterprises, government incentives and competition
continue to be the two most critical elements affecting pollution
prevention.

5.2.2. Driving force on economic performance
5.2.2.1. Relationship between driving forces and ﬁnancial
indices.
From the regression results of high-pollution enterprises (see
Table 5), the driving force within enterprises has a signiﬁcant effect
on ﬁnancial indices. While the pressure from the government,
market and society has little impact on the ﬁnancial indices.

As shown in the regression results of light-pollution enterprises,
the driving forces from within enterprises also exert a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the achievement of ﬁnancial targets while the
government, market and social pressure do not have signiﬁcant
impacts.

5.2.2.2. Relationship between driving forces and non-ﬁnancial indi-
ces. From the regression results of high-pollution enterprises, the
driving forces within enterprises and from the society and market
have signiﬁcant impacts on the improvement of enterprises’ non-
ﬁnancial indices. However, the impact of the community require-
ments is signiﬁcantly negative. The market driving forces also come
from the competitors. From the regression results of light-pollution
enterprises, adjusted R2 and F test are not signiﬁcant; therefore, all
the driving forces have no signiﬁcant effect on the non-ﬁnancial
indices for light-pollution enterprises (see Table 5).

It is used to think that government incentives and regulations
may have great impact on the economical performance of enter-
prises. However as shown in this study, the government driving
forces for these two types of SMEs are not statistically signiﬁcant,
which concurs with the result of the interview to SMEs and envi-
ronment consultants. Therefore, hypothesis 2a is not supported;
that is, the government driving forces do not have signiﬁcant impact
on the economic performance of SMEs. For high-pollution enter-
prises, the market driving forces from competitors contribute to
improvement in ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices (Hypothesis 2c
is supported). Meanwhile, community requirements can increase
the pressure on enterprises’ expansion, and produce a negative
effect on the economic performance (Hypotheses 2b and 2d are
partially supported).

5.2.3. Correlation of environment performance and economic
performance

It is generally accepted that the correlation is strong when the
absolute value of correlation coefﬁcient reaches 0.8 or more; the
correlation is a mediocre when it ranges from 0.5 to 0.8; a low
correlation when it is from 0.3 to 0.5 and a weak correlation when it
is from 0 to 0.3. By observing the correlation coefﬁcients between
environmental performance indices and economic performance
indices, it can be seen that for light-pollution enterprises, there is
a medium correlation between contamination control and ﬁnancial
indices (see Table 6). While, there is a low correlation between
ﬁnancial
indices and pollution prevention for high-pollution
enterprises.

When there is less external pressure, the aim of light-pollution
enterprises to implement contamination control is to enhance the
proﬁtability and operational ability. There is a positive correlation
between the contamination control and the ﬁnancial indices. While
for high-pollution enterprises, contamination prevention can
reduce the violation costs, which will create conditions for a steady
and continuous development. There is a certain level of correlation
between contamination prevention and ﬁnancial indices. Hypoth-
esis 3c (for SMEs of the two pollution levels of SMEs, high-pollution
enterprises and light-pollution enterprises,
the relationship
between environmental performance and economic performance
is different) is supported. There are medium correlations between
the environmental performance and the economic performance of
SMEs. Further, the correlation mainly appears between environ-
mental performance and ﬁnancial indices, instead of correlations
between environmental performance and non-ﬁnancial indices
(Hypothesis 3a, 3b are partially supported).

6. Discussion and concluding remarks

that have implemented little environmental management
to
improve. For social driving forces, community requirements of
residents for environmental pollution have great inﬂuence on
contamination control for SMEs. However, the impacts of envi-
ronmental organizations and media attention on environmental
performance for large enterprise are strong, but which are not
obvious for SMEs. As for the government driving forces, the effect of
the government incentives for contamination control or prevention
is greater than that of the government supervision. For enterprise
driving forces, that is, the enterprises’ own requests have not
brought signiﬁcant improvement on environmental performance.
Viewing from the economic performance, there is no doubt that
enterprises’ driving forces of
the high-pollution SMEs have
a signiﬁcant effect on both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices. In
addition, competitors’ pressures also play an important role in the
improvement of economic performance. Upgrading the concept of
industry-wide environmental protection can bring up the level of
overall proﬁtability and overall market expansion while the
community requirements of environment
for high-pollution
enterprise generate some obstacles for market expansion. Envi-
ronmental performance and economic performance of high-
pollution enterprises have a certain degree of positive correlation.
The practical implications for high-pollution SMEs to enhance

environmental management level are:

First, the government needs to strengthen the role of govern-
ment incentives to encourage enterprises to participate in the
implementation of environmental management. The govern-
ment tends to pay more attention in supervising the larger sized
enterprises, but lacks monitoring the large number of SMEs.
Therefore, only a few extreme SMEs whose production has
caused serious environmental accidents would be regulated.
Therefore, the government should devise special environmental
management measures for those high-pollution SMEs, and give
sufﬁcient ﬁnancial support (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies) and other
measures to motivate them to implement environmental
management.
Second, it needs to enhance the status of industrial association
and take measures to come up with consensus on environment
issues within the industry and implement industrial self-
discipline.
Third, it needs to pay better respect to buyers’ opinions. Many
overseas customers consider the environmental factor as an
important selection criterion in selecting suppliers from China,
which however has not been paid sufﬁcient attention by local
Chinese buyers and customers. The government
should
encourage green purchasing through some tangible (economic
ways) and intangible (such as media campaigns) incentives.

Market driving forces play an important role in improving
performance of contamination control and prevention, in which
pressure from competitors is particularly signiﬁcant. It is obvious
that raising the overall level of environmental management in the
whole industry has a very big positive effect on driving the SMEs

The society, market and government play an important role in
environmental performance for light-pollution SMEs. Community
requirements promote contamination control. Buyers’ demands in
the market can improve contamination control, which manifests

short-term effects of downstream enterprises for SMEs environ-
mental management, while competitors can upgrade the level of
contamination prevention, a long-term impact of environmental
management. Government aids could improve the performance of
contamination control because the light-pollution enterprises
would try to avoid legal penalties and enjoy preferential policies of
the government. Therefore, technology, information, and ﬁnancing
assistance from the government can be often able to achieve better
contamination control.

Enterprises’ driving forces are not directly related to the envi-
ronmental performance, which means contamination pollution
prevention and control cannot achieve the business development
goals.

For economic performance, only the enterprises’ driving forces
have some positive correlation with the ﬁnancial indices. However,
the government, market and social driving forces on economic
performance are not signiﬁcant. Environmental performance and
economic performance of light-pollution enterprises also have
a certain degree of positive correlation.

Though the light-pollution enterprises do not impose much
burden on the environment, their activities should not also be
overlooked because of their weak awareness of environmental
protection. The practical
implications for light-pollution enter-
prises to enhance environmental management level are:

First, the government needs to strengthen the role of govern-
ment assistance. It may be one of the most effective ways for
light-pollution enterprises because most of them are out of the
scope of governmental incentive plans and supervision. The
Government should provide more channels for supporting
environmental protection, such as promotion of new environ-
mental technologies, introduction of cleaner production and
implementation of environmental management system, infor-
mation channels of
environmental protection facilities
purchasing, loans for environmental management, etc. These
assistances will not consume much money from the govern-
ment, but can effectively enhance the level of environmental
control and prevention for light-pollution SMEs through long-
term support of technical, information, ﬁnancial services.
Second,
it needs to raise the environmental awareness.
Managers of light-pollution SMEs may not pay much attention
to environmental management of their business. As the results

enterprises,
pollution prevention (e.g., waste water re-use, dust recycling,
and reducing energy consumption) requires some resource
input, it can however proﬁt from positive economic beneﬁts.

the ﬁnancial

As this study is based on the investigation of SMEs in the region
of Northern China, validation of studies from other areas is
required. In addition, from the statistical analysis, it is found that
the control variables such as ﬁrm ages and others also provide
signiﬁcant impact on environmental performance and economic
performance for SMEs; therefore, the mechanism of these factors
need further empirical research.
