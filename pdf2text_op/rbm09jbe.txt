A Study of Management Perceptions
of the Impact of Corporate Social
Responsibility on Organisational
Performance in Emerging Economies:
The Case of Dubai

ABSTRACT. Although a number of studies have shown
that corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities often
lead to greater organisational performance in western
developed economies, researchers are yet to examine the
strategic value of CSR in emerging economies. Using
survey data from 280 firms operating in Dubai, this study
examines the link between CSR activities and organisa-
tional performance. The results show that CSR has a
positive relationship with all three measures of organisa-
tional performance:
financial performance, employee
commitment, and corporate reputation. These results
reinforce the accumulating body of empirical support for
the positive impact of CSR on performance and chal-
lenge the dominant assumption that, given the weak
institutional
framework in emerging economies, CSR
activities drain resources and compromise firms’ com-
petitiveness.

KEY WORDS: corporate social responsibility, organi-
sational performance, emerging economies, United Arab

Over the years, an enormous body of literature has
emerged concerning the link between corporate
social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and organisa-
tional performance (Margolis and Walsh, 2003;
McWilliams et al., 2006). Although extant research
has made some headway in understanding the asso-
ciation between CSR and organisational perfor-
mance,
two important
limitations that we seek to address in this paper. First,
extant research on the impact of CSR on organisa-
tional performance has
focused exclusively on

western developed economies. To date, scholars have
not examined the strategic value of CSR in emerging
economies. The limited body of research on CSR in
emerging economies has focused almost exclusively
on corporate citizenship, corporate irresponsibility,
and motives for CSR in these countries (Blowﬁeld
and Frynas, 2005; Frynas, 2005; Pedersen and
Huniche, 2006). While these studies are valuable,
they do not inform us of the strategic value of CSR in
these countries. In this paper, we aim to close this gap
by focusing on the strategic value of CSR in emerging
economies, using ﬁrm-level data collected from ﬁrms
operating in Dubai. Given that ﬁrms in emerging
economies are embedded in different business systems
from those of western ﬁrms, research on the associa-
tion between CSR and organisational performance in
emerging economies is warranted (Aguilera et al.,
2007; Campbell, 2006). Compared with those in
western countries, institutional legal frameworks in
emerging economies are not yet well developed,
which can limit the extent to which ﬁrms can beneﬁt
from their CSR efforts. In addition, an extensive
body of literature argues that managerial values and
attitudes towards CSR in a given institutional context
are likely to have a strong inﬂuence on the outcomes
of such initiatives (Aguilera et al., 2007; Frynas, 2005;
Hay and Gray, 1974; Hemingway and Maclagan,
2005; Pedersen and Huniche, 2006; Vitell and
Paolillo, 2004). In this paper, we focus speciﬁcally on
fast developing regions in emerging economies. Fast
developing regions are quickly growing commercial
and industrial hubs within emerging economies that
have achieved high economic growth rates. We

emphasise the focus on fast developing regions be-
cause we believe that there are signiﬁcant differences
between regions within emerging economies in terms
of economic growth, business environments, income
levels, and management practices. Although differ-
ences between regions do exist in developed econo-
mies, we believe these differences are more prominent
in emerging economies. For instance, there are con-
siderable differences between Dubai and the rest of
UAE in the way the Dubai economy is run, the
magnitude of economic and social changes, the level
of
the
intensity of competitive environment, and the dom-
inant aggressive business and management culture.

strategic
beneﬁts of CSR activities, scholars have not reached
a consensus on whether or not, and how, CSR
affects organisational performance (Husted and
Allen, 2007; Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky
et al., 2003). They disagree,
to
whether CSR has a positive or a negative impact, or
a neutral
impact on organisational performance
(Margolis and Walsh, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel,
2000; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wright and Ferris,
1997). A number of scholars have argued that the
lack of consensus is due partly to the use of ques-
tionable measures of organisational performance
(Carroll, 1991; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Waddock
and Graves, 1997; Wokutch and McKinney, 1991).
In particular, scholars highlight the limitations of
single measures of performance (Egri et al., 2004)
and over-reliance on ﬁnancial performance that, in
isolation, does not capture the full impact of CSR on
the ﬁrm’s overall performance (Husted and Allen,
2007). In this study, we address this issue with three
measures of organisational performance: the oft-used
ﬁnancial performance measure, as well as employee
commitment and corporate reputation.

This study is important for two reasons. First,
while the study of the relationship between CSR
and organisational performance is important in its
own right regardless of ﬁrms’ location, it is of par-
ticular
relevance in fast developing regions of
emerging economies given the immense impact that
ﬁrms located in these regions have on the environ-
ment because of the high level of energy they need.
Indeed, Parry et al. (1998, p. 741) noted that ‘‘most
future growth in emissions is expected to occur in

the fast-developing regions of Asia
and Latin
America’’. In addition, ﬁrms operating in these
regions may resort to unethical practices because of
pressure to achieve short-term ﬁnancial results and
sustain a global competitive edge. Second, as stated
above, although the association between CSR and
ﬁrm performance has been extensively debated, it is
still not well understood. In this paper, we reﬁne the
stream of research on the association between CSR
and organisational performance by moving from the
broad question of whether CSR has an impact on
performance to a study of the association of CSR
with three speciﬁc aspects of organisational perfor-
mance: ﬁnancial performance, employee commit-
ment, and corporate reputation.

The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows. We begin this study by reviewing extant lit-
erature on the relationship between CSR and
organisational performance. We then propose a set
of hypotheses pertaining to the nature of the impact
of CSR on organisational performance in emerging
economies. Next, we discuss the measures used in
the study and describe the data collection method.
We then report the results of the survey that tests the
hypotheses. We conclude by discussing the ﬁndings,
highlighting the key limitations of the study, and
providing guidance for further research.

Literature review and research framework

CSR and organisational performance

Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to understand the
impact of CSR activities on organisational perfor-
mance (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Husted and Allen,
2000; Husted and Salazar, 2006; Marom, 2006;
McWilliams and Siegel, 2001; Moneva et al., 2007;
Orlitzky et al., 2003; Salzman et al., 2005; Schuler
and Cording, 2006; Swanson, 1995, 1999; Waddock
and Graves, 1997; Windsor, 2001; Wood, 1991;
Wood and Jones, 1995; Wright and Ferris, 1997).
Our review of some of the key studies on the rela-
tionship between CSR and organisational perfor-
mance indicates positive, negative, mixed, or
non-signiﬁcant results
(see Table I). The review
shows that while a number of studies reported a
negative relationship (Vance, 1975), or no signiﬁcant
relationship (Aupperle et al., 1985; Davidson and

Worrell, 1990; McGuire et al., 1988; Preston, 1978;
Spicer, 1980) between CSR and organisational
performance, the bulk of studies reported a positive
relationship (Abott and Monsen, 1979; Bragdon and
Marlin, 1979; Graves and Waddock, 1994; Mosko-
witz, 1972; Spencer and Taylor, 1987; Waddock and
Graves, 1997).

Pava and Krausz’s (1995) comprehensive review
of empirical studies of the relationship between CSR
and organisational performance found that, overall,
ﬁrms perceived as having met social responsibility
criteria have either outperformed or performed as
well as other ﬁrms that are not necessarily socially
responsible. Such positive relationship has also been
supported by a recent meta-analysis of the relation-
ship between CSR and organisational performance
(Orlitzky et al., 2003). However, as noted above,
one cannot generalise the above ﬁndings
from
western developed economies to emerging econo-
mies without further research. Business system the-
that countries have
ory (Whitley, 1992) holds
different business systems. Therefore,
it stands to
reason that in order to hypothesise a relationship
between CSR and organisational performance in
emerging economies it is important to understand
the institutional and managerial characteristics of

these economies. The institutional environment in
fast developing economies like Dubai is driven by
policies that promote high economic growth and
international competitiveness, but if not properly
managed, may lead to social inequality, poor labour
practices, and enormous environmental damage.

Dubai has sustained a period of rapid growth
during the last three decades, moving from an ob-
scure semi-nomadic emirate to a global commercial
hub that has recently built up signiﬁcant competitive
advantages. Dubai’s growth has been prompted by
two main factors. The ﬁrst is ambitious and visionary
leadership, and the second is an aggressive open
market strategy. The fast growth in the economy,
generated by extensive factor inputs, has resulted in
unequal welfare distribution and unlimited market
opportunities
for
opportunistic behaviour. Business media are replete
with anecdotal examples of unscrupulous ﬁrms
resorting to socially irresponsible practices to achieve
high proﬁts at the expense of employee welfare,
customer safety, and the environment. These prac-
tices range from mistreatment of workers to dis-
honesty with customers. Scholars argue that
the
weak enforcement of laws and regulations gives the
impression that ﬁrms can get away with socially

A number of scholars (Campbell, 2006; Gala-
skiewicz, 1991; Mellahi, 2007) argue that while
negative sanctions enforced through regulation may
constrain and discourage ﬁrms from acting in a
socially irresponsible manner, adherence to socially
responsible behaviour develops from the presence
of
such as business and
industrial associations that are able to mobilise and
entice ﬁrms to subscribe voluntarily to CSR. Thus,

UAE to promote CSR initiatives
to mitigate
harmful consequences of fast economic growth on
pollution, customer protection, and labour prac-
tices, CSR remains a low priority in these countries
compared with western developed countries. Fur-
ther, there is a lack of favourable institutions con-
ducive to the practice of CSR. For
instance,
absence of non-governmental institutions and social
associations capable of raising social expectations
and exerting pressure on ﬁrms does not motivate
ﬁrms to adopt CSR activities. Below we hypoth-
esise the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial
performance, CSR and employee commitment,
and CSR and corporate reputation.

CSR and ﬁnancial performance

Financial performance is one of the most studied
indicators of the strategic value of CSR (Orlitzky
et al., 2003). Margolis and Walsh’s (2001) meta-
analysis found that 55% of the 160 studies examined
identiﬁed a positive relationship between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance, 22% reported no relationship,
18% found a mixed relationship, and 4% a negative
relationship. Orlitzky et al. (2003) conducted another
meta-analysis and found similar results. These studies
lend credence to the widely accepted notion that
being socially responsible would,
in most cases,
improve a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance. Indeed,

(Allouche

A number of arguments and rationales have been
advanced as to why CSR has a positive impact on
ﬁnancial performance
and Laroche,
2006). One of the prominent arguments is that the
ways in which a ﬁrm satisﬁes its stakeholders and
communicates CSR activities to stakeholders can
affect
its ﬁnancial performance. Orlitzky et al.
(2003, p. 405) noted that ‘‘the satisfaction of vari-
ous stakeholder groups is instrumental for organi-
sational ﬁnancial performance’’. Therefore, one
could argue that in emerging economies, the link
between CSR and a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance is
contingent on stakeholders’ perceptions of and
subsequent reactions to CSR efforts. Stakeholders’
reaction to CSR efforts is mediated by the avail-
ability and intensity of information on CSR ini-
tiatives and preferences of stakeholders relative to
available alternatives (Schuler and Cording, 2006).
Hartman et al. (2007) argued that notwithstanding
the motivation for the engagement, ﬁrms must
ultimately communicate their rationale for CSR
engagement to stakeholders.

Overall, ﬁrms in emerging economies do not
appreciate the critical importance of communicating
their CSR activities to stakeholders (Foo, 2007;
Wright et al., 2003). In the case of Dubai, factors
contributing to ineffective engagement with stake-
holders and lack of communication of CSR activities
include the following:1 lack of effective communi-
cation channels with stakeholders; failure to manage
stakeholders
strategically or to make stakeholder
management an organisational priority among ﬁrms
with a monopoly position in the UAE market; dif-
ﬁculty in communicating with stakeholders because
of the diversity of interests and cultural backgrounds
of
(temporary migration in Dubai
exceeds 80% of the local population); and inability to
build long-term relationships and trust because of
high turnover of managers and employees resulting
from a turbulent labour market.

stakeholders

These factors minimise stakeholders’ needs and
result
in reluctance of ﬁrms to engage in CSR
activities that might be perceived as having little
beneﬁt for stakeholders. Further, because of the lack
of communication platforms to disseminate infor-
mation about CSR activities, CSR efforts often go
unnoticed and are largely unknown to stakeholders


376

Belaid Rettab et al.

and subsequently may not have an impact on
performance. Further, Mellahi and Wood (2003)
argued that because stakeholders are often not aware
of CSR activities in emerging economies, CSR
activities may even have a negative impact on
ﬁnancial performance. Foo (2007) argued that CSR
puts social constraints on ﬁrms that may be in con-
ﬂict with the pursuit of ﬁnancial gains.

While the above discussion suggests that ﬁrms in
emerging economies may not be rewarded for their
CSR initiatives even when they take serious steps
towards CSR, we argue that stakeholders do not
react negatively towards ﬁrms that engage in CSR
activities for two key reasons. First, based on the
above discussion, one would assume that in emerging
economies stakeholders are not fully aware of ﬁrms’
CSR activities and therefore ﬁrms will not be
rewarded or punished for their CSR efforts. Second, as
a consequence of the strong economic growth, most
ﬁrms have ample resources at their disposal to divert
to SCR activities. Therefore, on balance one could
argue that ﬁrms are able to engage in CSR activities
without damaging their ﬁnancial health but also
without reaping rent-like advantages from their CSR
initiatives (Schuler and Cording, 2006). Based on the
above, we propose the following hypothesis.

H1: CSR is not positively related to ﬁnancial

performance in emerging economies.

CSR and employee commitment

Broadly deﬁned, employee commitment refers to
‘‘the extent to which a business unit’s employees are
fond of the organisation, see their future tied to that
of the organisation, and are willing to make personal
sacriﬁces for the business unit’’ (Jaworski and Kohli,
1993, p. 60). Aguilera et al.
(2007) noted that
employees make judgments about their employer’s
CSR efforts based on their observations of the ﬁrm’s
CSR actions, outcomes of the CSR actions, and the
handling of the implementation process. The authors
posit that ‘‘socially responsible or irresponsible acts
are of serious consequences to employees’’ (p. 843).
A number of studies have explored the link between
CSR and employee commitment
(Albinger and
Freeman, 2000; Backhaus et al., 2002; Greening and

matter to its employees (Albinger and Freeman,
2000; Backhaus et al., 2002; Greening and Turban,
2000; Peterson, 2004; Turban and Greening, 1997),
and tend to have a positive impact on employees’
commitment. Branco
(2006)
reported that ﬁrms perceived to have a strong social
responsibility image often have an increased ability
to attract better job applicants, retain them once
hired, and maintain employee morale. Similarly,
Maignan et al. (1999) posited that ﬁrms that engage
in CSR activities are likely to enjoy enhanced levels
of employee commitment for two main reasons: (1)
they are dedicated to ensuring the quality of work-
place experiences, and (2) they address social issues –
such as the protection of the environment or the
welfare of the community – that are of concern to
society in general and therefore also to employees.
The above discussion is in line with the extensive
research on employees’ justice perceptions, which
posits that employees’ perceptions of their ﬁrms’
CSR activities shape their perceptions of the ﬁrm
(Rupp et al., 2006). Furthermore, ﬁrms that engage
in CSR tend to extend their CSR efforts internally
to their
and socially
responsible practices (Rupp et al., 2006). Therefore,
it is reasonable to expect that ﬁrms that engage in
CSR activities will foster a positive relationship with
their employees, and as a result they are more likely
to earn employees’ commitment than ﬁrms that do
not engage in CSR initiatives (Aguilera et al., 2007).
In addition, contrary to the presumed link between
CSR activities and drivers of ﬁnancial performance,
CSR activities are easily observed by employees and
as a result may make an instant favourable impression
on them that could boost their morale and their
commitment to the ﬁrm. Given that a number of
ﬁrms in emerging economies take advantage of a
weak institutional environment to develop exploit-
ative working conditions where workers are poorly
paid and work excessive hours in hazardous working
conditions
(Budhwar and Mellahi, 2007), CSR
activities beneﬁting employees make a signiﬁcant
difference and are highly appreciated by employees.
Taking the above arguments as a whole, we advance
the following hypothesis:

through fair

H2: CSR is positively related to employee com-

mitment in emerging economies.

CSR and corporate reputation

Existing research provides evidence to suggest that
corporate reputation is a pivotal intangible resource
that contributes to a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage
(Barney, 1991; Deephouse, 2000; Fombrun and
Shanley, 1990; Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Shamsie,
2003), ‘‘precisely because the development of a good
reputation takes considerable time and depends on a
ﬁrm making stable and consistent investments over
time’’ (Roberts and Dowling, 2002, p. 1091). Cor-
porate reputation is enhanced or destroyed by ﬁrms’
decisions to engage or disengage in CSR activities.
Bhattacharya and Sen (2003) pointed out that CSR
‘‘builds a reservoir of goodwill that ﬁrms can draw
upon in times of crisis’’. Similarly, McWilliams and
Siegel (2001, p. 120) reported that CSR ‘‘creates a
reputation that a ﬁrm is reliable and honest’’.

The link between CSR and corporate reputation
in emerging economies
straightforward.
Contrary to employee commitment where employ-
ees are able to observe their ﬁrms’ CSR activities, the
impact of CSR on corporate reputation, in the eyes
of different but mostly external
is
shaped by how the ﬁrm communicates its CSR
activities and how its activities are reported in the
national media and other communication mediums.
Branco and Rodrigues (2006) noted that when ﬁrms
are able to demonstrate, by communicating effec-
tively with a wide range of stakeholders, that they
operate in accordance with social and ethical criteria,
they can build a positive reputation, whereas failing
to do so can be a source of risk to their reputation.
As discussed earlier, the two pre-conditions for
CSR to have an impact on corporate reputation –
ability to communicate the strategy to key stake-
holders and media interest in the topic – are not
always available to ﬁrms operating in emerging
economies. The lack of
in
communicating internal activities such as CSR ini-
tiatives to outsiders in emerging economies impedes
ﬁrms’ ability to inform their stakeholders about their
CSR activities. This
the ﬁrm’s ability to
inﬂuence stakeholder perceptions in order to boost

skills and traditions

limits

its corporate reputation. Further, CSR is not yet an
established topic in emerging economies; therefore,
the media may not give ﬁrms engaged in CSR ini-
tiatives the required space to help them generate
public goodwill that could ultimately translate into
an attractive corporate reputation. We propose that
because of the lack of visibility of CSR activities in
emerging economies, CSR will not have an impact
on corporate reputation. We thereby advance the
following hypothesis:

H3: CSR is not positively related to corporate

reputation in emerging economies.

Data collection

Data on CSR practices in the UAE were collected
through a survey of organisations based in Dubai.
The survey was designed in English, because English
is the language of business communication in Dubai.
We collected all the data via the survey because,
unfortunately, reliable objective data of any kind is
hard to come by in the UAE, and given the poor
reliability of most ofﬁcial data, we believe the best
data that can be collected and used is perception data.
Following Huber and Power’s (1985) guidelines for
obtaining quality data from key informants, we
developed a survey using Dillman’s (1978) method
and administered it to company executives drawn
from the membership of the Dubai Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (DCCI) database. In addi-
tion, we performed a pilot
study with business
executives to assess the quality of the research design.
These steps resulted in some minor stylistic changes
being made, mainly to the instructions to respondents
and the need to keep the responses anonymous.

The sampling frame consisted of a total of 2,200
companies, with 310 responding, for an effective
response rate of 14%. A total of 280 companies
remained in the sample after companies missing
either CSR or organisational performance data were
eliminated, giving a ﬁnal response rate of 13%. Each
of the 2,200 questionnaires was e-mailed and/or
faxed to the identiﬁed contact person along with a
cover letter explaining the nature of the study and
the promise of conﬁdentiality. After the original
mail-out, two follow-up mailings were sent that
included duplicate and cover letters, questionnaires

(the second and third mailings were sent to the non-
respondents three weeks after each previous mail-
ing). We used Armstrong and Overton’s (1977)
extrapolation procedure to assess non-response bias.
No signiﬁcant differences were found between the
early and late respondents. Thus, non-response bias
is unlikely to be an inhibitor in our analysis.

As shown in Table II, the ﬁnal sample included
61 ﬁrms from manufacturing, 51 from trading and

from real estate, rental, and business services, 14
from education, seven from banking and ﬁnancial
services, two from mining, and two ﬁrms not able to
classify their sector of activity. The executives who
responded had been with their ﬁrms for an average
of 11 years; they represented ﬁrms that had existed
for an average of 18 years and employed an average
of 276 people (see Table II).

itors. Cronbach’s a for ﬁnancial performance is 0.85.
Employee commitment was measured using a
three-item questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale,
from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.
The items were derived from Jaworski and Kohli
(1993) and include the following items:
‘‘our
employees often go above and beyond their regular
responsibilities
to ensure the organisation’s well
being’’; ‘‘the bonds between this organisation and its
employees are very strong’’; and ‘‘our people are very
committed to this organisation’’. Cronbach’s a for
employee commitment is 0.84. Corporate reputation
was measured using three items on a 5-point Likert
scale,
from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly
agree. The items were adopted from a scale devel-
oped by Fombrun et al. (2000) and measure mana-
gerial perception of stakeholders’ perception of the
reputation, trustworthiness, and quality of its offer-
ings. Cronbach’s a for corporate reputation is 0.70.

Financial performance was measured by seven items
on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 = strongly disagree
to 5 = strongly agree. The ﬁrst two items were
adopted from Deshpande et al. (1993) and measured
the ﬁrm’s relative market share and size compared
with competitors, the third item was adopted from
Jaworski and Kohli (1993) and measured the ﬁrm’s
performance relative to competitors, and the last

Control variables

We controlled for three variables that are reported to
signiﬁcantly impact the effects of CSR on organi-
sational performance. First, past research provides
evidence that the size of the ﬁrm has an impact on
the association between CSR and organisational
performance (Moore, 2001; Preston, 1978; Stanwick
and Stanwick, 1998). This is because stakeholders
expect more social initiatives from large corporations
than small ones. For example, large multinationals
and publicly traded companies are more pressured to
display their commitment to CSR as a result of
consumer and shareholder activism against
large
multinationals (Drawbaugh, 2001; Klein, 1999). In
addition, small ﬁrms are less able than their large
counterparts to communicate their CSR activities to
external stakeholders. Thus, we controlled for the
size of the ﬁrm and measured size by the number of
employees.

Second, the type of CSR activities ﬁrms engage in
depends on their sector of activities (McGuire et al.,
2003; Waddock and Graves, 1997). For instance,
ﬁrms in the oil sector are involved more in envi-
ronmental issues, while ﬁrms in the food industry
are involved more in health and safety and com-
munity-related CSR activities. Further, Kolk (2003)
reported that industries differ in their propensity to
engage in CSR initiatives. Thus, we controlled for
sector of activity. Firms were grouped into ﬁve
sectors, namely tourism, manufacturing, real estate,
trading, and banking and ﬁnance sectors. Third,
consistent with past research (Delaney and Huselid,

1996) we controlled for the age of the ﬁrm. We
measured age by the number of years since estab-
lishment in Dubai.

Reliability and validity of measurement
scales

Although we employed widely used measures, we
subjected the constructs used in this study to stan-
dard testing steps to make sure our constructs were
reliable and valid (see Ping, 2004 and Slater et al.,
2006). Following the steps used by Slater et al.
(2006, p. 1226), we analysed the psychometric
properties of the constructs used in this study in
conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL
8.80. Additionally, we evaluated the ﬁt of
the
measurement model. Again, following Slater et al.
(2006), we examined the high-order structure of
CSR to provide empirical support for the focus on
CSR construct at the higher-order aggregate level.

Construct reliability, convergent and discriminant validity

We assessed the construct reliability by calculating a
composite reliability (CR) for each construct. We
used the procedures
suggested by Fornell and
Larcker (1981) to calculate the CR index (CRI).2
Along with reliability calculations, we also examined
the parameter estimates and their associated t-values
and assessed the average variance (AVE)3 of each
construct
(Anderson, 1982; Bagozzi and Lynn,
1982). AVE was used to gauge convergent validity
(Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Ping, 2004). Fornell and
Larcker (1981) and Ping (2004) suggested conver-
gent measures should contain less than 50% error
variance (i.e. AVE should be 0.5 or above). We used
the cut-off value of 0.70 and 0.50 for CR and AVE,
respectively (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Hair et al.,
1998). The scales’ reliabilities ranged from 0.78 to
0.88, the factor loadings ranged from 0.40 to 0.92
(p < 0.01), and AVE ranged from 0.50 to 0.89 (see
Table IV).

Following the reliability analysis, we established
discriminant validity by calculating the shared
variance4 between each pair of constructs and veri-
fying that it was lower than the average variance
extracted from the individual constructs (Bagozzi and

ances between pairs of all possible scale combinations
indicated that the average variances extracted were
higher than the associated shared variance in all cases.
In other words, they are more internally correlated
than they are with other constructs. This suggests
discriminant validity of the construct in this study.

DELTA2 = 0.92, CFI = 0.95, NFI = 0.91, GFI =
0.90, TLI = 0.94, PNFI = 0.68, RFI = 0.89, and

that, in addition to the item loadings reported in

As such, community responsibility (loading = 0.45,

(loading = 0.56, t-value = 5.72, p < 0.01), supplier

the higher-order construct of CSR (R2s range from
20% to 66%). The model ﬁt for the higher-order

for NFI and GFI, 0.93 for TLI, 0.68 for PNFI, 0.68

Following Ping (2004), construct validity of the
second-order construct
suggested by plausible
correlations of the second-order construct with the
other
study variables, while convergent validity
could be suggested by an AVE for the second-order
construct that is greater than 0.5. The second-order
CSR scale reliability was 0.79, the factor loadings
ranged from 0.59 to 0.86 (p < 0.01), and the average
variance was 50%. Overall, the nine measures in the
ﬁrst-order construct as well as the second-order

context of this study.

Multiple regression was used to assess the impact
of CSR on ﬁnancial performance, employee com-
mitment, and corporate reputation. As noted above,
we controlled for three control variables: ﬁrm age,
size, and sector of activity. Preliminary analyses were
performed to ensure no violation of
the key
assumptions of normality, linearity, multicollinearity,
and homoscedasticity.

Table VII reports results of the regression analysis
of the different organisational performance measures.
We ran two regressions for each performance mea-
sure; one with the control variables (Model 1), and
one without (Model 2). Inspection of Table VII
shows that all performance measures are signiﬁcantly
associated with CSR. Contrary to our expectation,
we did not ﬁnd support for our ﬁrst hypothesis;
the results show that CSR activities have a signiﬁ-
cant positive impact on ﬁnancial performance
(R2 = 0.112, p < 0.01). It is worth pointing out
here that although the model is statistically signiﬁ-
cant, the R2 is very small.

The positive and statistically signiﬁcant association
between employees’ commitment and CSR initia-
tives supports our second hypothesis (R2 = 0.254,
p < 0.01). However, contrary to our expectations
(Hypothesis 3), the results show that CSR activities
have a positive and statistically signiﬁcant impact on
a ﬁrm’s reputation (R2 = 0.203, p < 0.01). Overall,
we ﬁnd a
and positive association

signiﬁcant

between CSR activities and all measures of perfor-
mance used in this study.

Discussion and conclusion

In this study we explored the association between
CSR and organisational performance in emerging
economies, focusing speciﬁcally on the fast devel-
oping region of Dubai. By so doing, we sought to
extend the current body of research on the associa-
tion between CSR and organisational performance
in emerging economies. Our
results are fairly
straightforward: CSR has a signiﬁcant and positive
association with all performance indicators used in
this study.

The most important ﬁnding in our study, and
contrary to our prediction, is the positive association
between CSR and ﬁnancial performance. This result
is consistent with previous empirical studies con-
ducted in western developed economies showing a
positive relationship between CSR efforts and
ﬁnancial performance. Conﬁrming the relationship
between CSR and ﬁnancial performance in an
emerging economy is signiﬁcantly important for a
number of reasons. While scholars and practitioners
in western developed economies have a wealth of
evidence on the relationship between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance, to the best of our knowledge,

A Study of Management Perceptions of the Impact of CSR

385

this is the ﬁrst systematic study that provides evi-
dence of this relationship in a non-western context.
In fast developing regions in emerging economies,
where most of the emphasis is on economic growth
and competitiveness, CSR is given low priority.
Although it is likely that some ﬁrms may engage in
CSR activities largely on moral grounds, providing
evidence of a positive link between CSR and
ﬁnancial performance may help ﬁrms enact CSR
initiatives.

results

Furthermore, our

raise serious doubts
about the validity of the assertion that, as a result of
the absence of strong institutional support for CSR,
and presence of weak and ineffectual laws to guard
against unethical practices, ﬁrms in emerging econ-
omies do not capture rents from their CSR activities
(Foo, 2007). This viewpoint posits that competi-
tiveness in emerging economies is based on slash and
burn, exploitative human resource practices. Con-
sequently, CSR has no place in these countries. For
example, Foo (2007) argues that the dominant par-
adigm in emerging economies is the saying that
‘‘they (competitors) are ethical, so we have the
competitive edge!’’ This is because, he argues, in
emerging economies, ﬁrms engaged in CSR activi-
ties ‘‘will have to suffer unnecessary cost burden and
‘competitive disadvantage’ against their unethical or
irresponsible counterparts’’. Further, Foo (2007)
argues that ﬁrms offering ‘‘greener products cannot
compete with their less ethical counterparts who
offer cheap but environmentally unfriendly prod-
ucts’’. Unfortunately, prior to this study, there was
little empirical evidence to refute the argument that
CSR activities drain resources away and compro-
mise ﬁrms’ competitiveness, and to support
the
assertion of a positive association between CSR and
ﬁnancial success in emerging economies. Thus, our
ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence to
challenge the assertion that unethical ﬁrms crowd
out ethical ones in emerging economies.

As expected, the results show that CSR initiatives
have a positive association with employee commit-
ment. This is understandable because ﬁrms that are
engaged in CSR activities generally tend to have fairer
HR practices, and are highly regarded by their
employees (Aguilera et al., 2007). This is because, in a
country where more than 90% of employees are
expatriates and a large number of them are on short-
term contracts working in an institutional environment

in which no safety net or alternative economic or
social provision exists for employees, and where the
interests of employees are not well represented
(Budhwar
are
vulnerable, and their welfare depends almost entirely
on good will vouchsafed them by their employers.

and Mellahi, 2007), employees

Another unexpected result of this study is the
positive relationship between CSR and corporate
reputation. We reasoned that ﬁrms in emerging
economies would not be able to beneﬁt from their
CSR initiatives in terms of corporate reputation
because of the lack of skills and effective channels to
communicate CSR activities to external stakehold-
ers. We conjecture that perhaps because of the small
size of Dubai, ﬁrms are able to make their CSR
initiatives visible. Another plausible explanation for
the positive impact of CSR on corporate reputation
is the fact that CSR is currently being heavily pro-
moted by a number of institutional bodies such as
the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, which has a
dedicated CSR and ethics centre (Centre for
Responsible Business), which enables ﬁrms engaged
in CSR activities to celebrate their success and boost
their corporate image and competitiveness.

This study has a number of implications for theory
and practice. It bolsters and reinforces the accumu-
lating body of empirical support for the positive
impact of CSR on organisational performance.
Although our results are by no means novel within
the broad CSR–organisational performance litera-
ture, they extend the current body of knowledge
beyond western developed economies. Further, this
study shows that the impact of CSR on organisa-
tional performance in emerging economies is similar
to that in western developed economies. At the
centre of our argument
for potential differences
between developed and emerging economies is the
fact that emerging economies have different business
systems that may moderate the impact of CSR ini-
tiatives on organisational performance. Therefore,
on the basis of these results, scholars should perhaps
put less emphasis on the institutional differences
between developed and emerging economies when
it comes to CSR activities. Although the focus on a
fast developing region in an emerging economy is a
contribution of this study, it might limit the gener-
alisability of our ﬁndings to other emerging econo-
mies. There are large differences in institutional

economies. As far as CSR is concerned, the lack of
regulations, combined with intense competition and
cut-throat practices in Dubai, may lead some ﬁrms
to act in socially irresponsible ways to achieve their
short-term economic objectives. However, since the
government
is able to monitor ﬁrms’ activities
because of the small size of the emirate, ﬁrms need to
sustain a high standard of honesty and integrity to be
able to operate successfully in the market. Also,
given the high per capita income in Dubai, ﬁrms
tend to make higher proﬁts and therefore have high
ﬁnancial slack, enabling them to give to charities,
engage in community activities, and promote other
CSR activities.

For practitioners, this study provides empirical
evidence to support CSR initiatives in emerging
economies. Our experience with CSR managers in
Dubai suggests that CSR champions are often dis-
mayed at being unable to prove the worth of CSR
activities. The positive impact of CSR on organi-
sational performance reported in this study should
help address concerns often expressed by sceptics
about the value generated by CSR activities. The
results of this study should also be of value to senior
managers concerned with the overall performance of
the ﬁrm. The positive impact CSR initiatives have
on organisational performance underscores
the
importance of CSR in the quest
for sustainable
competitive advantage in both developed and
emerging economies. Firms are able to reap tangible
beneﬁts,
such as higher ﬁnancial performance,
higher employee commitment, and better reputation
by engaging in CSR activities. Therefore, on the
basis of this study, it is not advisable to marginalise
CSR activities in emerging economies.

A number of limitations suggest that our results
should be viewed cautiously. Our study is based on
perceptual data, and although perceptual measures of
organisational performance are well established and
widely accepted, we would welcome studies based
on objective data, particularly regarding ﬁnancial
measures of performance. In addition, because we
collected data on the dependent and independent
variables through the same self-report survey, our
data may suffer from measurement bias.5 Further,
this study provides evidence of the types of links
between CSR initiatives and different
types of
performance but does not help us understand the
process through which CSR impacts performance.

We would welcome detailed case study research to
shed light on the afore-mentioned process. Finally,
this study is based on data from a single country, and
caution must be taken when generalising the results
of this study to other emerging economies.

Shared variance was calculated as

where c2 = shared variance between constructs,
and with the diagonal element of w indicating the
amount of unexplained variance. Because g and e
were standardised, c2 was equal to the squared cor-
relation between the two constructs.
