 Research Notes

 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND

 STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE

 GORDON J. ALEXANDER

 University of Minnesota

 ROGENE A. BUCHHOLZ

 Washington University

 The relationship between the market performance of a firm's common
 stock and its social responsibility has been the subject of contradictory views
 in the past. One view is that a socially aware and concerned management
 will also possess the requisite skills to run a superior company in the 'tradi-
 tional sense of financial performance, thus making its firm an attractive
 investment. (The Dreyfus Third Century Fund is based on this view. The
 fund invests in companies that not only meet traditional investment criteria,
 but which also in their view make contributions to the enhancement of the
 quality of life in the U. S. relative to other companies in the same industry. )
 This view has been suggested by Moskowitz (1972), who subsequently
 attempted to validate it empirically. Moskowitz first selected 14 firms that
 possessed what he believed were good social responsibility credentials, and
 then calculated the rate of return on their common stock for the first half
 of 1972. After noting that the 14 stocks had appreciated an average of 7.28
 percent while major market indices such as the Dow-Jones Industrials had
 appreciated by much smaller amounts, Moskowitz interpreted these results
 as support for his view.

 A contradictory view is that socially responsible firms will be at a
 competitive disadvantage due to the added expense incurred by such be-
 havior. This view has received support in a study by Vance (1975). Vance's
 study was based on two surveys previously taken by Business and Society
 Review ("How Business School Students .. .," 1972; "Industry Rates Itself,"
 1972) where businessmen and students rated 45 and 50 leading firms,
 respectively, on their perceived degree of social responsibility. Each of
 these surveys yielded a ranking of the firms as to their degree of social
 responsibility. (Both surveys indicated a wide range of social responsibility,
 as there were firms rated from outstanding to poor.) Using these two rank-
 ings, Vance observed a negative correlation between rank and stock market
 performance during 1974.

 Thus these two studies came to different conclusions regarding social
 responsibility and stock market performance. Both, however, have certain
 empirical deficiences. First, they evaluated stock performance for only a

 short period of time - six months in the Moskowitz study and 12 months
 in the Vance study. Second, neither study evaluated stock market per-
 formance on a risk-adjusted basis. This study will correct for these defi-
 ciences, allowing a more definitive statement to be made regarding the
 relationship between social responsibility and stock market performance.

 Performance Measurement

 When evaluating security returns, it is insufficient to only consider rates
 of return. Securities are generally described in terms of two parameters,
 return and risk, and it is generally accepted that higher risk securities should
 have higher returns than lower risk securities. In evaluating security per-
 formance, therefore, it is necessary to incorporate both risk and return in
 the analysis.

 Jensen (1968) has devised a method for measuring security performance

 on a risk-adjusted basis. In involves a regression model based on the Sharpe-
 Lintner (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965) capital asset pricing model:

 Rjt - RFt -= aj -+ 3 [Rmt - RFt] + Ejt (1)

 where Rjt denotes the rate of return on security j at time t; RFt is the risk-
 free rate of return; and Rmrt is the rate of return on the market. Here crj
 and /i are the regression parameters with random error term Ejt. The
 intercept term at can be interpreted as a measure of stock market per-
 formance on a risk-adjusted basis. Frequently called differential return, it
 measures the return on security j earned above or below a hypothetical port-
 folio of similar risk formed from a linear combination of the market port-
 folio and risk-free asset. A positive differential return indicates the security
 earned more than the market on a risk-adjusted basis, and a negative
 differential return indicates the security earned less than the market on a
 risk-adjusted basis. The parameter pj, frequently called the beta coefficient,
 can be interpreted as a measure of the risk of security j, with higher values
 being associated with higher risk securities.

 The Data

 The social responsibility rankings used in this study were the same as
 those used in the Vance study. The first two columns of Table 1 reflect the
 firm rankings. Four of the firms in the two surveys were eliminated from
 consideration in this study, as they were mutual life insurance companies
 and hence had no common stock. These firms were Equitable Life,
 Prudential, Metropolitan Life and John Hancock. Since 40 of the remaining
 firms were surveyed by both businessmen and students, the rank order cor-
 relation coefficient between the two surveys was calculated. Its value of
 .6584 (significantly positive at the .05 level) shows a fairly strong degree
 of agreement between the two surveys. Security returns for each of these

 firms were calculated monthly over the five-year period 1970-1974, as
 shown by Fama (1976, p. 12), using:

 Rjt = (Pt- Pjt- + Djt)/Pjt-1 (2)

 where Pit denotes the price of security j at the end of month t and Djt de-
 notes all dividends received during month t. (The businessmen survey was
 taken in the fall of 1971 and the student survey was taken in the spring of
 1972. Since these ranks may change through time, the five-year period 1970-
 1974 surrounding the survey dates was chosen for analysis. The three-year
 subperiod 1971-1973 was also analyzed.) All prices were adjusted for
 stock dividends and splits.

 Since (1) was used to measure the differential returns of the securities,
 it was necessary to have monthly rates of return on both the market (RMt)
 and risk-free asset (RFt). The Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Index
 and the 30-day Treasury bill rate respectively, were used for this purpose.

 Empirical Results

 Differential returns and risk measures of the securities in the social

 responsibility surveys were calculated for the five-year sample period 1970-
 1974 and a three-year subperiod 1971-1973. As shown in Table 1, few
 securities had differential returns significantly different from zero - two
 in the five-year period and three in the three-year subperiod. It appears
 from this analysis that there is no significant effect of social responsibility
 on stock market performance.

 The measures of differential return were ranked in descending order over
 both the five and three-year periods, and then rank order correlations were
 calculated between survey rank and differential return rank. These correla-
 tions, shown in Table 2, generally indicate a low insignificant relationship
 between risk-adjusted performance and degree of social responsibility.
 [Since the measure aj of differential return is an estimate based on the
 regression equation (1), it is subject to an errors-in-variables bias (John-
 ston, 1972, pp. 281-291). Hence tests of significance using oaj may be
 inaccurate, but are reported here for the reader's information. These com-
 ments are also applicable to the measure 3j of risk.]

 The beta coefficient in (1) can be interpreted as a measure of risk of
 the firm. In order to see whether there was a relationship between security
 risk level and the degree of social responsibility, rank-order correlations
 were calculated between survey rank and beta coefficient rank. As shown
 in Table 2, these correlations generally indicate a low insignificant relation-
 ship between risk and degree of social responsibility.

 An interesting observation in Table 1 involves the correlations reported
 for the three and five-year periods analyzed. In certain instances, such as
 First National City Bank, the correlation drops as the estimation interval is
 shortened. In other instances, such as Ford, the correlation rises. A possible
 reason for this, as reported by Blume (1975), is that the betas may change

 over time in response to certain changes in the structure (e.g., operating
 and/or financial leverage) of the companies. Inclusion of companies such
 as First National City Bank and Ford should not bias the results presented
 here, as these changes in correlation seem to be fairly evenly distributed,
 both in direction and size, throughout the range of survey ranks.

 Conclusion

 The results of this study indicate that the degree of social responsibility

 as measured by the rankings of businessmen and students bears no sig-
 nificant relationship to stock market performance. Furthermore, there seems
 to be no significant relationship between stock risk levels and degree of
 social responsibility. These findings suggest that the interpretations of both
 Moskowitz and Vance are invalid.

 A possible third view on the relationship between stock market perfor-

 mance and social responsibility, consistent with the findings of this study,
 assumes that stock markets are efficient, as described by Fama (1970).
 In an efficient stock market, new information relevant to the earnings out-
 look of a firm is immediately reflected on the current stock price. Thus
 any positive or negative effects associated with the degree of social responsi-
 bility of a firm are reflected immediately in its stock price. Since a large
 majority of the firms sampled in this study had stock returns which were
 no different from the market on a risk-adjusted basis, under this view the
 effects of the degree of social responsibility on stock prices were either non-
 existent or had occurred prior to 1970.
