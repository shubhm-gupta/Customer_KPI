Abstract The purpose of this study is to examine three electric utilities, two publicly owned and
one privately owned. The basis of this examination is legitimacy theory employing a small sample
case-type approach. In particular we are interested in social and environmental disclosures found
in annual reports and how these disclosures differentiate between publicly owned and privately
owned enterprises. In our examination we use some traditional efficiency measures but we also
employ effectiveness measures relying on the proprietary costs and information costs views in our
analysis. Our major findings are that ownership status and size, which are likely to affect
influence the amount of social and environmental disclosure. Finally, while
legitimacy,
environmental disclosures seem to be related to information costs and benefits,
this
relationship does not seem to hold for social disclosures.

Introduction
Accounting-based efficiency measures have provided the means of comparison
between public (i.e. government owned) and private firms for several decades.
One particular industry that has been examined repeatedly is the electric utility
industry.

In attempting to address whether privately owned electric companies
outperform their publicly owned counterparts, researchers have found mixed
results. Vining and Boardman (1992) classified empirical studies comparing
private versus public companies by the studies' findings. Under the electric
utility industry, Vining and Boardman listed 13 published papers. Five of these
studies (Shepherd, 1966; Moore, 1970; Peltzman, 1971; De Alessi, 1974, 1977)
found private companies outperformed public firms, three (Meyer, 1975;
Neuberg, 1977; Pescatrice and Trapani, 1980) found public outperformed
private companies and five (Mann, 1970; Yunker, 1975; DiLorenzo and
Robinson, 1982; Fare et al., 1985; Atkinson and Halvorsen, 1986) found no
difference between public and private companies.

The mixed results of the 13 cited studies are interesting for two reasons.
First, these firms operate in highly regulated environments. Consequently, if

there were any differences, it might be expected that private companies would
outperform their public equivalents. Second, the apparent bias of some
researchers is evident in their discussions of privately owned and publicly
owned firms[1]. With respect to most of the comparisons made, the researchers
have used relatively large sample sizes focusing on cost, profit and technical
efficiency measures.

It has been argued that efficiency measures fail to capture all of the goals
and objectives of enterprises (Gordon and Cormier, 1996; Gordon and Boland,
1998). Examples of efficiency measure failures are the exclusion of externalities
and ignoring longer-term social goals such as minority employment. While a
privately owned, profit-oriented company may be able to ignore externalities
and other social goals, the accountability of publicly owned enterprises in
North America makes them vulnerable to criticism if management ignores such
goals. Given this social setting, measurement of the effectiveness of meeting
social goals by both privately owned and publicly owned enterprises seems
appropriate.

The purpose of this study is to examine three electric utilities, two publicly
owned and one privately owned. The basis of this examination will be
legitimacy theory employing a small sample case-type approach rather than
the large sample sizes often used. In particular we are interested in the types of
annual report disclosures made and how these differentiate between publicly
owned and privately owned enterprises. While some traditional efficiency
measures are examined, we also examine effectiveness measures. Included in
these effectiveness measures are environmental and social disclosures found in
annual reports. By examining the companies in this format, we begin the
development of a framework involving effectiveness measures for the
evaluation of private versus public firms.

One type of research that employs small samples is case study research. In
such research, the authors examine the facts surrounding one or more
situations and use qualitative analysis as opposed to the more predominant
quantitative analysis. As Bonoma (1985, p. 203) states ``[a] growing number of
. . .
researchers in economics,
sociology, . . . and psychiatry have advocated and helped foster rebirth of
qualitative research in the social sciences''.

. . . organizational behavior,

. . . medicine,

Bonoma (1985, p. 202) also notes that ``dissatisfaction with the application of
quantitative research methods and strategies has emerged, particularly as they
are applied to phenomena not easily operationalized or easily observable
outside the natural settings in which they occur . . . ''[2]. In particular we think
that effectiveness measures of firm performance are not easily operationalized
(i.e. quantified) and should be studied with an awareness of the context.
However, case study or small sample size research need not be limited to
qualitative research. As Yin (1994) indicates, various quantitative analyses
may also be used to help describe and explain the findings of such research[3].
Thus in this paper, the three companies are studied using both qualitative
information and quantitative analysis.

The paper is presented in five sections. The second section presents a
discussion of three bodies of literature, organizational
legitimacy theory,
environmental accounting research, and proprietary and information costs.
The organizational
legitimacy theory indicates why legitimation for a
government owned enterprise might be different from a privately owned
company. The environmental accounting research provides evidence that an
enterprise's size is an important variable and that such disclosures are related
to effectiveness measures. The proprietary and information costs literature
outlines how the risk faced by a firm in capital markets affects its reporting
strategies. The third section describes the three companies examined in this
paper as well as their regulatory environments. In the fourth section, two
additional pieces of quantitative evidence are used to make comparisons
between the three companies. Finally, a conclusion and limitations are
presented.

Three bodies of literature
The three bodies of literature described below are relevant to the visibility or
accountability issue. Legitimacy theory literature indicates that more attention
will be paid to those companies that are more ``visible'' or rely more on political
or social support. One of the findings in some of the environmental accounting
research is that the size of the company matters. If, as hypothesized, larger
companies have greater visibility and are more politically sensitive than
smaller firms (Watts and Zimmerman, 1978), then larger companies would be
expected to make more disclosures. These disclosures in turn may affect capital
markets that represent one potential place where all firms issuing debt or
equity are visible. This would follow whether the companies are privately or
publicly owned.

Legitimacy theory
Legitimacy theory rests on the concept that organizations have contracts with
society and fulfilling these contracts legitimates the organizations and their
actions. As outlined by Rousseau (1975)
in 1762 a social contract is an
association that people (or organizations) enter into freely to enhance society's
overall welfare. These contracts then are used as the basis for the inclusion of
social preferences into corporate actions (Shocker and Sethi, 1974; Mathews,
1997). Where an organization is successful in meeting such contracts, this leads
to congruence between the organization and society.

Dowling and Pfeffer (1975, pp. 126-7) indicated that organizations may take

certain actions to become legitimate or to maintain their legitimacy:

First, the organization can adapt its output, goals and methods of operation to conform to
prevailing definitions of
through
communication, to alter the definition of social
legitimacy so that it conforms to the
organization's present practices, output, and values. Finally, the organization can attempt,
again through communication, to become identified with symbols, values, or institutions
which have a strong base of social legitimacy.

Gray et al. (1995, p. 54) outlined Lindblom's 1992 description of legitimacy
theory[4]. According to Gray et al. Lindblom refined how organizations may
react to legitimacy concerns by employing four strategies. These strategies can
be related to Dowling and Pfeffer's three actions. For example, Lindblom stated
that the organization may take measures to educate society as to changes in the
organization's actions (relates to Dowling and Pfeffer's first action). The second
strategy is to alter how society perceives an organization's actions without
making any changes to those actions (Dowling and Pfeffer's second action). A
third strategy is one of manipulation where the organization attempts to divert
society's attention away from the issues of concern to alternative issues
(Dowling and Pfeffer's third action). Lindblom's final strategy is where an
organization seeks to alter society's expectations of it (relates to Dowling and
Pfeffer's second action)[5].

Accounting and financial

reporting represent ways an organization
communicates with society and its stakeholders, thereby legitimating its
actions. Brown and Deegan (1998) pointed out that legitimacy theory has been
the basis for several studies of social responsibility and environmental
disclosures that have used annual reports and financial statement data.

Some of the examinations employing accounting and financial statements
have been longitudinal studies of one company. In his study, Hogner (1982)
looked at US Steel Corporation's annual reports for an 80-year period. Guthrie
and Parker's (1989) paper examined 100 years of Australia's Broken Hill
Proprietary Company Limited. In the Hogner paper, a link was made between
social disclosures and expectations by the community for social performance.
Guthrie and Parker found that while environmental social reporting could be
explained using legitimacy theory, other social disclosures could not be
explained.

Patten's 1992 paper used legitimacy theory to study changes in
environmental disclosures by North American oil companies after the Exxon
Valdez oil spill. As Patten expected, the oil spill represented a threat to the
legitimacy of oil companies. This threat necessitated an increase in the oil
companies' environmental disclosures in their annual reports.

Australian company data have formed the basis for four recent studies
(Deegan and Gordon, 1996; Deegan and Rankin, 1996; Brown and Deegan, 1998;
Wilmshurst and Frost, 2000) that have relied on legitimacy theory for their
explanations. Deegan and Gordon's (1996) results provided evidence of three
relationships. First, companies' environmental reporting was positively related
to the increase in environmental
the sample
companies' reporting emphasized the positive actions taken. Third, an
industry's environmental sensitivity was positively correlated with the amount
of disclosure made by the corporations in that industry. Deegan and Rankin
(1996) examined how prosecutions for environmental offences were related to
changes in environmental reporting in annual reports. They found there was a

more positive reporting than did a matched sample of companies that had not
been prosecuted. Brown and Deegan (1998) explored the relationship between
the coverage given by the print media to certain industries and the effect this
coverage had on the level of environmental disclosure. They found increased
print media attention resulted in higher levels of environmental disclosure.
Using a mail survey of 62 CFOs coupled with content analysis of the CFOs'
companies' environmental reports, Wilmshurst and Frost
found
significant correlations between those factors managers rated as important and
their companies' environmental disclosures. These authors concluded there
was limited support for legitimacy theory as an explanation of the relationship
between managers' decision processes and the environmental disclosures made
by their companies.

(2000)

Savage et al. (1999) explored the disclosures made by two Canadian pulp and
paper companies. Using a legitimacy theory framework, the pulp and paper
companies' environmental disclosures were explained from a social contract
perspective. This was accomplished by classifying disclosures into symbolic
versus substantive legitimations.

Falconbridge, a Canadian company, was used by Buhr (1998) to test whether
legitimacy theory or political economy theory better explained the company's
sulphur dioxide emissions disclosures for a 28-year period. Overall, her
findings were that legitimacy theory offered the better explanation. Buhr found
that the disclosures were motivated by Falconbridge's use of technology rather
than by the use of its annual report as a device to further a corporate viewpoint
on social, political and economic points.

The studies cited to this point have focused on privately owned
corporations. Thus, the effect of government (i.e. public) versus private
ownership in a legitimacy setting deserves further examination. Dowling and
Pfeffer (1975, p. 133) indicated ``(w)hile legitimacy is a constraint on all
organizations, it is likely that it affects some organizations more than others.
This is because (1) some organizations are considerably more visible, and (2)
some organizations depend relatively more heavily on social and political
support''. Government owned enterprises would certainly seem to fit the
second point since they exist due to social and political support. As well,
government owned enterprises may be more visible, and hence more
vulnerable, in the political sense because government accountability is often
an election issue.

Research on environmental accounting reporting
Environmental accounting research has examined various aspects of the
disclosure process. Some studies have focussed on when firms disclose. For
example, Rezaee et al. (1995) and Gamble et al. (1995) addressed disclosures
required by regulators and accounting standard setters. The findings of these
studies are critical of present mandated disclosures because these either do not
specifically address the issue of environmental reporting (Rezaee et al., 1995) or

592

they result in insufficient information to meet the users' needs (Gamble et al.,
1995).

While regulators and standard setters serve as motivators for the disclosure
of information, other motivations also have been examined. The motivations
studied for environmental reporting range from legitimacy theory (e.g. Parker,
1986; Deegan and Gordon, 1996; Brown and Deegan, 1998), to stakeholder
theory (e.g. Roberts, 1992), to political economy theory (Tinker et al., 1991), to
the role of public or external pressure (Patten, 1991; Neu et al., 1998; Walden
and Schwartz, 1997), and to information costs and benefits (Cormier and
Magnan, 1999). The overall conclusion from these articles is that interest
groups, stakeholders and society have some influence over the types and
timing of firms' disclosures.

Other

researchers have studied different aspects of environmental
disclosure. For example, studies have addressed the relationship of
environmental reporting to:

. environmental performance (Wiseman, 1982; Ingram and Frazier, 1980;

Fekrat et al., 1996; Ilinitch et al., 1998);
the market (Belkaoui, 1976; Freedman and Stagliano, 1991; Blacconiere
and Patten, 1994; Little et al., 1995; Cormier and Magnan, 1997); and

.

. users (Buzby and Falk, 1978; Rockness, 1985; Tilt, 1994).

An overall conclusion from these studies is that environmental reporting has
some effect but the effects vary due to factors such as industry and types of
disclosures made.

examined the

Researchers also have

firms making environmental
disclosures. Freedman and Jaggi
(1986) examined the characteristics of
environmental disclosing firms compared to nondisclosing firms. Two other
studies (Barth et al., 1995; Li et al., 1997) focussed on what determines the
disclosure of environmental
liabilities by firms. From these studies, one
important characteristic emerges. Firm size seems to influence the amount of
environmental disclosures made.

Important to the present study is the idea that environmental reporting often
takes a qualitative form (e.g. see Wiseman, 1982). Qualitative disclosures are
more easily related to a company's effectiveness (i.e. getting the job done) than
to its efficiency (i.e. a comparison of inputs used to outputs). For this reason,
environmental reporting is used as a basis of comparison for the companies
studied.

Proprietary and information costs
In this paper we contend that firms' environmental disclosures are related to
``proprietary costs'' (Verecchia, 1983; Scott, 1994). Proprietary costs arise due to
the existence of proprietary information. Proprietary information is private
information, which is value-relevant to the price of a firm's shares, or debt
traded in capital markets. This information is known by managers but is

unknown by investors until the information is made public. This lack of
disclosure occurs even though more disclosure has been found to benefit firms
through lower costs in, or easier access to, capital markets (e.g. Botosan, 1997).
The potential of decreased future cash flows provides one explanation for
nondisclosure of proprietary information (Dye, 1985). As noted by Cormier and
Magnan (1999), proprietary information may be used by third parties (e.g.
employees, customers, suppliers and competitors) to enhance their positions
vis-aÁ -vis the disclosing firm in contract negotiations or competitive situations.
From a management perspective, nondisclosure of proprietary information can
result in lower third party costs.

As one type of proprietary information, environmental disclosures may
represent significant costs to the firm when made publicly available. Where
costs are excluded from financial statements, these may affect share prices
or debt contracts as well as the firm's reputation when subsequently
disclosed. Examples of proprietary information that may have potentially
significant costs related to them include environmental
liabilities or
commitments.

Social disclosures represent an additional type of proprietary information.
These disclosures indicate what various stakeholders think a firm ought to
be doing. Examples of this type of proprietary information include the
number of minorities hired, employee training costs, as well as money spent
on regional development. Failure to disclose this information may be due to
an unsatisfactory record. If an unsatisfactory record is later disclosed, this
may prove costly to the firm in the capital markets due to decreased
reputation. Thus, social and environmental disclosures will be avoided
where managers have the perception that the associated proprietary costs
are high.

In situations where managers have access to information that investors do
not,
information asymmetry exists (Grossman, 1981; Milgrom, 1981).
Nondisclosure may influence investors to assume the worst about a firm,
causing the investors to bid down the stock price or require an interest rate
premium on debt. Alternatively,
investors may seek and collect more
information. A rational investor would be expected to seek more information
where enough time and money exists and where the benefits from
information gathering are expected to exceed the costs of the information
gathering process.

Individual collection of information may be inefficient from a societal
perspective (Diamond, 1985) because scarce resources (i.e. time and money) are
being used to collect the same information many times. In this situation a firm's
voluntary disclosure of the information is a more efficient way to meet
investors' needs (Atiase, 1985; Lang and Lundholm, 1993). Firms have an
incentive to reduce information asymmetry where they rely on the capital
markets (Gibbins et al., 1990; Frankel et al., 1995) to reduce perceived riskiness
and hence the cost of capital (Botosan, 1997). Where firms rely on capital
markets for either debt or equity financing, the reliance on capital markets will

be associated with environmental and social disclosures (Scott, 1994; Cormier
and Magnan, 1999).

Legitimacy theory, environmental reporting, and the proprietary and
information costs literatures lead to the conclusion that a firm's ownership
structure, its size relative to other firms in the same industry and the risk faced
in capital markets will affect its reporting strategies. Publicly owned firms are
expected to face greater pressures than privately owned firms to disclose
additional information due to visibility and accountability issues resulting
from the large number of stakeholders. This large number of stakeholders
means that the benefits of disclosure are likely to outweigh the associated costs
for the publicly owned firms. Publicly owned firms are therefore expected to
provide more social and environmental disclosures than privately owned firms.
Where there is a difference in size between firms in the same industry,
expectations are that
firms will provide more social and
environmental disclosures. With respect to capital markets it is expected that
firms which are concerned with investors' risk perceptions will provide more
social and environmental disclosures than other firms. We examine these
expectations in the following sections.

Regulation, the examined companies and descriptive information
The three companies chosen for examination are Hydro-QueÂbec, BC Hydro and
TransAlta. Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro are government owned enterprises
operating in the Canadian provinces of QueÂbec and British Columbia
respectively. TransAlta is a privately owned company operating in Canada in
the province of Alberta. These companies are examined for the period 1985
through 1996.

Regulatory and company backgrounds
In 1996 the Canadian electric utility industry was highly regulated under the
control of provincial governments[6]. Regulation involved a range of issues
from the environment to the rates charged domestic customers. The primary
disclosure sources used in this study are the companies' 1985 through 1996
annual reports including the financial statements. The types of disclosures
made in the financial statements were those required by Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles at the statement dates. As indicated in the audit
reports of the companies these accounting principles applied to both privately
and publicly owned electric utilities.

With respect to environmental regulation, the Canadian scene is a mix of
federal and provincial
legislation where the federal statutes generally
represent enabling and facilitating legislation aimed to produce federal-
provincial co-operation (OECD, 1995, p. 30). This type of structure results
from the fact that provinces control natural resources. However, in more
recent times, the federal government has set minimum standards for such
things as energy efficiency but
regulations for
implementation (OECD, 1995, p. 30).

In QueÂbec, under Hydro-QueÂbec's Act, assented to December 23, 1996, the
ReÂgie de l'eÂnergie has exclusive jurisdiction to determine or modify the rates
and conditions under which electricity is transmitted or supplied by
Hydro-QueÂbec. Before that date, Hydro-QueÂbec reported directly to the QueÂbec
government. In BC Hydro's home province regulations were, and continue to
be, set by the British Columbia Public Utilities Commission (British Columbia
Public Utilities Commission, 1989; Financial Post DataGroup, 1996, p. 160). In
Alberta where TransAlta operates, the regulatory body was the Alberta Public
Utilities Board (now the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board) (Financial Post
DataGroup, 2000, p. 3).

Hydro-QueÂbec was incorporated in 1944 and is responsible for generating,
transmitting and distributing most of the electrical power consumed in the
province of QueÂbec. Hydro-QueÂbec is one of the largest electric utilities in both
Canada and North America. Power is generated primarily by hydro-electric
plants (varied between 96 percent in 1985 and 93 percent in 1996) with the
remainder of power being generated by thermal electric plants (Financial Post
Information Services, 1986, p. 322; Financial Post DataGroup, 1996, p. 411). As
of 1995, 30 percent of the thermally generated power (or approximately 2
per cent of the total power generated) came from nuclear stations with the
remainder being generated by oil, gas-turbine and diesel units (Hydro-QueÂbec,
1995, p. 65).

Incorporated in 1962, BC Hydro is the primary source of electrical power
generation, transmission and distribution in the province of British Columbia
and is the third largest electric utility in Canada. BC Hydro serviced between 90
and 94 percent of the provincial population during the 1985-1996 period (BC
Hydro, 1985/1986 and 1996,
inside cover). Power generation came from
approximately 90 percent hydro-electric plants and 10 percent thermal plants
for the period studied (Financial Post Information Services, 1986, p. 81;
Financial Post DataGroup, 1996, p. 160).

TransAlta Utilities Corporation was originally incorporated in 1947. During
the period under study, TransAlta was engaged in the generation, transmission
and distribution of electric energy (Financial Post DataGroup, 1996, p. 767). In
1985 TransAlta provided 81 percent of the electricity used in Alberta and about
two-thirds of the electricity consumed by Alberta utility customers in 1996
(TransAlta Corporation, 1985, p. 2; 1996, inside cover). Electrical power is
generated by a combination of coal-fired thermal plants and hydro-electric
plants. As of 1996, thermal production represented 95 percent of the output
(TransAlta Corporation, 1996, inside cover).

TransAlta was chosen as the privately owned firm to study for a variety
of reasons. First, most Canadian electric utilities during the study period
(1985-1996) were government owned. Second, TransAlta was the largest
privately owned Canadian electric utility in terms of both revenues and total
assets during the period (Financial Post
Information Services, 1986;
Financial Post DataGroup, 1996)[7]. Third, it is a firm deemed to be an
``excellent'' company in the popular press. Additionally, TransAlta has made

direct comparisons on a cost dimension between itself, Hydro-QueÂbec and
BC Hydro in its annual reports (e.g. TransAlta Corporation, 1995, p. 25; 1996,
p. 15).

The background of the three companies highlights a major difficulty faced
by many researchers who choose to use real data. The data are sometimes
messy, meaning that researchers are faced with trying to control
for
confounding effects. In this study, we are faced with three variables that may
confound our examination and conclusions. The first variable is ownership
(private vs. public). The second variable is the three companies' sizes and the
third variable relates to the companies' production processes[8]. In the later
sections of the paper, we have tried to control for these confounding effects. For
example with respect to size, we have weighted certain variables by total
assets. Our control for production processes takes the form of using firm
specific variables. Finally, we use a dummy variable for type of ownership
when appropriate. However, despite having used these control techniques,
some conclusions we might like to draw may be limited.

Examination of the financial measures indicates that both Hydro-QueÂbec and
BC Hydro are much larger than TransAlta. For example using total assets as a
proxy for size, Hydro-QueÂbec is almost ten times, and BC Hydro is slightly
more than twice, the size of TransAlta. This size pattern is also reflected in
both the average number of full-time employees[9] and new investment in fixed
assets for the 12-year period.

Deviations from the ten-to-one and two-to-one size patterns are seen in the
average amount of long-term debt held, common shareholders' equity and
earnings. Hydro-QueÂbec holds 19 times, and BC Hydro holds five times, the
amount of long-term debt compared to TransAlta. This means, of course, that
common shareholders' equity for Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro represents a
smaller proportion of their total assets compared to TransAlta. With respect
to average earnings for the 12 years, Hydro-QueÂbec earned three times more
than TransAlta while BC Hydro earned only 83 percent of TransAlta
earnings.

Eight efficiency ratios are reproduced in Table I. These are: net fixed
assets to full-time employees; leverage (debt to equity); return on equity;
earnings to full-time employees; new investment in fixed assets/common
shareholders' equity; interest coverage; and capitalization rate. With the
exception of net fixed assets to full-time employees, TransAlta's 12-year
averages are better than those of either Hydro-QueÂbec or BC Hydro. Of
particular note are the net fixed assets to full-time employees, leverage
ratio, interest coverage, return on equity (ROE) and earnings to full-time
employees. TransAlta has a higher ROE while employing fewer fixed
assets to full-time employees and maintaining less debt. Based on these
efficiency measures alone, TransAlta outperforms its government-owned
counterparts.

The ABIGOOD news/ABIBAD news variables represent the number of
news stories about a particular firm in a given year using the ABI Inform
database (Table I). On average Hydro-QueÂbec received more media attention
(good news and bad news) than either BC Hydro or TransAlta. BC Hydro on
average was mentioned in more good news items than was TransAlta (0.667 vs
0.333). However, BC Hydro was mentioned less often in bad news items than
TransAlta (0.083 vs 0.333) for the 1985-1996 period.

The number of environmental disclosures (ENVIRDISAR) made in the
annual reports was also collected. Indexes have been calculated in the
literature to measure the level of environmental disclosure found in a firm's
annual and environmental reports and as a proxy for the firm's voluntary
environmental reporting strategy (e.g. Fekrat et al., 1996; Cormier and
Magnan, 1999). For this study environmental disclosures are measured using
the ``Environmental Disclosure Index'', an updated version of the Wiseman
Index (1982) as adapted by Cormier and Magnan (1999) (see Appendix 1). This
index is based on a score of one to three, where a three is given for an item
described in monetary or quantitative terms, a two is given for a specifically
described item and a one is given for an item discussed in general terms. For
the three sample firms annual reports issued between 1985 and 1996 were
read. The environmental disclosure items were noted and scored using the
described index. The individual scores were reviewed independently by two
people to ensure consistency over time and across firms. Referring to Table I,
both Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro on average (13.59 and 12.75 respectively)
made slightly more environmental disclosures in their annual reports than did
TransAlta (11.17).

SOCIALDISAR is the final variable found in Table I. This variable captures
the average number of social disclosures made by each company over the 12-
year period in the annual reports. SOCIALDISAR includes information items
such as employee training, charitable contributions and service interruptions.
The average disclosures of SOCIALDISAR are higher for Hydro-QueÂbec (7.25)
and BC Hydro (2.50) compared to TransAlta (1.17) as one would predict using
either legitimacy theory or the size factor.

Taken together the four items of good news, bad news, environmental
disclosures and social disclosures in Table I suggest one conclusion regarding
the qualitative measures. In this study the publicly owned firms disclosed more
qualitative information and had more disclosed about them than did the
privately owned TransAlta.

Table II presents the results of t-tests comparing the financial ratios as
well as the ABIGOOD and ABIBAD News disclosures, ENVIRDISAR,
SOCIALDISAR and a new variable, CAPITAL MARKETS, for the three firms.
CAPITAL MARKETS is a variable introduced to capture a significant change
in a firm's debt to equity ratio from one year to the next. For this study a
significant change is defined as being at least 25 percent.

The basis of comparison in Table II is public versus private observations.
For these tests there were a total of 24 public (Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro

each for 12 years) and 12 private observations (TransAlta for 12 years). Other
items reported in Table I such as total assets and liabilities were not tested for
significant differences because of the major differences in the sizes of the three
companies. With the exception of the ABIBAD News, the net fixed assets
divided by full-time employees, CAPITAL MARKETS and ENVIRDISAR, all
the other variables are significantly different at 0.01 or less. Net fixed assets
divided by full-time employees is significant at a 0.061 level while the ABIBAD
News, CAPITAL MARKETS and ENVIRDISAR variables are insignificant.
These results support the less formal inspection of Table I including the
finding that the privately owned company, TransAlta, was more efficient in
terms of the given financial ratios.

While the average number of social (SOCIALDISAR) disclosures differs
significantly between publicly and privately owned firms, the lack of a
significant difference for ENVIRDISAR in Table II is of interest because the
finding seems to be counter-intuitive. From legitimacy literature we would
expect
that government owned firms would produce more disclosures
because of their visibility. From the more general accounting research we
would expect that larger firms (i.e. Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro) would
produce more environmental information. However, the firms examined here
operate in a regulated industry. Such regulation serves to ensure that certain
types of information, and especially environmental disclosures, are made.
What
the results given in Table II cannot explain are the possible
relationships between environmental disclosures and other efficiency and
effectiveness variables.

Table III provides disclosure details for each year from 1985 to 1996 by
company. An examination of these details enhances understanding of the
environmental and social disclosures made by the three companies and how
these disclosures changed over time.

that

The

early years under

examination indicate

relatively few
environmental disclosures were made. For 1985 Hydro-QueÂbec scored a five,
TransAlta scored a three and BC Hydro scored a zero. Using 1995 as another
comparison year, Hydro-QueÂbec's Environmental Disclosure Index was 14, BC
Hydro's 12 and TransAlta's was ten. However, the highest index for each
company was achieved in different years. The highest Environmental
Disclosure Index was in 1990 for Hydro-QueÂbec (24), 1993 for BC Hydro (29)
and 1989 for TransAlta (19). The high 1990 Environmental Disclosure Index
for Hydro-QueÂbec may have been tied to a reporting structure change (Hydro-
QueÂbec, 1990, p. 5). Commencing in 1990, the National Assembly of QueÂbec's
standing committee where Hydro-QueÂbec had to appear was enlarged. This
enlarged committee was to receive a ``Hydro-QueÂbec Development Plan every
three years, following consultations with interested parties'' (Hydro-QueÂbec,
1990, p. 9). A review of the 1993 annual report for BC Hydro did not yield any
specific event or events that explained its highest Environmental Disclosure
Index. However, TransAlta's highest index came in the same year the
company's management made a submission to the Canadian House of

Commons Standing Committee on the Environment. From the annual report it
is unclear whether the increase in the index and this submission are related or
just coincidental.

Two types of environmental disclosures made by electric utilities are of
special interest to a variety of stakeholders. These disclosures concern air
emissions and effects on water resources. Using the 1987 (first year all three
companies have an Environmental Disclosure Index) and 1995 reports (a year
in which the Environmental Disclosure Index is similar for all
three
companies), these two types of disclosures are outlined.

In 1987 Hydro-QueÂbec provided few details regarding air emissions or
water resources. The primary air quality issue contained in this annual report
dealt with the implementation of non-smoking legislation (Hydro-QueÂbec,
1987, p. 13). In the technology section of the annual report, two items are
discussed that could have related to air or water pollution. These technical
points were completion of laboratory and field tests for various types of
insulators (Hydro-QueÂbec, 1987, p. 16) and the assessment of a pilot project
for generation of energy using wind. In the section on environment, Hydro-
QueÂbec's annual report outlined a continuing study of how its construction
projects affected the environment (Hydro-QueÂbec, 1987, p. 20) and a program
undertaken jointly with the Cree aboriginal community to solve a mercury
problem in the James Bay regions' lakes and reservoirs ( Hydro-QueÂbec, 1987,
p. 21).

Under the environmental protection section in 1995, Hydro-QueÂbec (1995,
p. 16) detailed its participation in wildlife protection efforts that included
waterfowl and fish. Also, mention was made of the James Bay Mercury
Agreement that noted this project's continuation and a finding that mercury
levels were expected to return to ``natural values'' within 25 to 30 years
(Hydro-QueÂbec, 1995, p. 17). A second project involving the Cree community
indicated Hydro-QueÂbec had provided more than $4 million devoted to
``remedial work'' for certain water resources to foster ``hunting and fishing
activities''. Additionally, Hydro-QueÂbec indicated a general policy of internal
environmental assessments that would presumably involve potential air and
water pollution ( Hydro-QueÂbec, 1995, p. 16).

BC Hydro's 1987 annual report contains no discussion of the effect that
power generation had on water resources, fish or wildlife habitat. The only
mention of BC Hydro's air emissions is contained in a statement that its
Burrard Thermal generating station had its emission permit
issued as
confirmed by the Environmental Appeal Board (BC Hydro, 1987, p. 4).

By 1995 BC Hydro's air emission and water resources disclosures increased
substantially. In 1995 BC Hydro's annual report was split into two components,
one containing the financial statements and a corporate review explaining its
activities. From the corporate review, BC Hydro noted that it had initiated a
plan to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 75 percent over the following
five years. This decreased pollution was to be accomplished by use of new
technology at the Burrard Thermal generating station (BC Hydro, 1995 p. 20).

Fish and wildlife populations in two river systems were to be enhanced
through a $4.1 million dollar fund. Additionally, for three other rivers water
releases from hydro-electric plants were to be assessed due to concerns about
fish habitat. Finally, a study was being launched to examine concerns about
dams and residents living below the dams due to potential earthquake hazards
( BC Hydro, 1995, p. 21).

TransAlta indicated in 1987 (p. 4) it had access to low-cost, low-sulphur coal
through its mining activities. As well, TransAlta's (1987, p. 10) annual report
included a statement that it was developing a low NOx SOx (oxides of nitrogen
and sulphur) burner capable of controlling for emissions from both the
sub-bituminous coal used by TransAlta as well as the bituminous coal used in
eastern Canada and the US. With respect to water resources, TransAlta
outlined how it was replacing two lakes that had been drained in 1984 to allow
for coal extraction. The replacement lake cost $2 million and was thought to
``provide habitat for wildlife'' as well as ``recreational opportunities for people
living in the area''(TransAlta Corporation, 1987, p. 10).

As with Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro, TransAlta also provided more
information in 1995 compared to 1987 on its air emissions and effects on
water resources. Air emissions were addressed in a discussion of greenhouse
gases. TransAlta outlined a voluntary plan it had submitted to the Canadian
Government in September 1995 that addressed a range of operations and
improvements (TransAlta Corporation, 1993, p. 21). Additionally,
in the
sustainable development section, TransAlta outlined how through efficiency
measures it had reduced air emissions in a thermal plant and reduced water
use in a hydro-electric facility by adopting a new turbine (TransAlta
Corporation, 1995, p. 10). Attention to water resources included discussion of
two specific examples, concerns with water levels at a thermal plant and
regulation of water flow at a hydro-electric plant (TransAlta Corporation,
1995, p. 21).

From Table III Hydro-QueÂbec's social disclosures indicate an increasing
trend from four disclosures in 1985 to nine disclosures in 1996. Hydro-QueÂbec
provided the highest number of disclosures in a given year with ten in each of
1991 and 1992. BC Hydro provided at least, one social disclosure each year from
1985 to 1996. TransAlta provided the fewest total social disclosures with four
years (1985, 1986, 1989 and 1990) having zero disclosures and only 1995 with a
high of three disclosures.

Table IV provides a listing of the 12 socially descriptive variables that form
the basis of SOCIALDISAR. Four of these variables are efficiency related:
training costs as a percentage of sales, purchases of goods and services,
residential costs/kilowatt, and research and development costs. The remaining
eight variables are indicative of effectiveness measures. Data for each of these
variables were collected from the three companies' annual reports. Of interest
are the ``total
instances of disclosure'' for these 12 items. Hydro-QueÂbec
discloses these variables in 87 instances as compared to a maximum of 144 (12
items by 12 years)
instances. BC Hydro discloses in 30 instances while

Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 07:11 03 February 2017 (PT)
TransAlta has the fewest disclosures at 14. This evidence is consistent with
other studies that have found that larger firms provide more disclosures than
do smaller firms.

Only one of the four efficiency variables (residential costs/kilowatt) has
information provided by all three firms. For the remaining three efficiency
variables, Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro provide some information for two of
them with Hydro-QueÂbec alone supplying information for the third (research
and development expenses).

Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro while two measures (gifts and sponsorships;
contributions to United Way) are provided by Hydro-QueÂbec and TransAlta.
Hydro-QueÂbec alone reports on number of women employed, number of days of
training per employee and percentage of PCB contaminated material recovered
that was recycled. Finally, referring to Tables II and IV, evidence is found of a
positive relationship between media exposure and social disclosures. Hydro-
QueÂbec provided the largest total number of social disclosures (87) and received
the most media citations for both good and bad news. TransAlta had the fewest
social disclosures and the fewest good news citations by the media. Publication
of more good news than bad news stories (e.g. Hydro-QueÂbec and BC Hydro)
may indicate firms' reporting strategies influence the media. We examine this
in more detail in the following section.

Additional quantitative evidence
As argued earlier, we maintain that publicly owned firms face different
from society than do privately owned firms. Social
expectations
(SOCIALDISAR) and environmental disclosures (ENVIRDISAR)
in annual
reports are thought to relate to the social goals and objectives facing firms.
What we examine next is the relationship of social and environmental
disclosures to the variables provided in Table II. We use a framework based on
information and proprietary costs to begin this examination.

To examine how proprietary and other information disclosures relate to the
financial ratios presented in Table II, we provide two additional pieces of
quantitative evidence. First, correlation coefficients between the types of
disclosures (social or environmental) and the other variables are provided.
Second, a sensitivity test using the variable mean differences based on the level
of disclosure (i.e. high disclosing firms compared to low disclosing firms) is
outlined.

As mentioned, we used the Environmental Disclosure Index to score
elements of environmental disclosures. This index highlights information that
is proprietary in nature because it reflects the firm's actual plans and
initiatives. Financially sound firms are predicted to disclose proprietary
information (e.g. environmental information). For these firms the benefits of
making disclosures outweigh the costs related to disclosing proprietary
information to employees, competitors, suppliers or other third parties.

However, firms in poor financial condition are predicted to avoid disclosing
proprietary information. In this situation, the costs associated with proprietary
disclosures are expected to outweigh the benefits of making the disclosures in
the minds of the firm's managers.

Social disclosures represent the number of proprietary or informational
items disclosed by a firm each year in the annual report. As with environmental
disclosures, firms that are financially sound are expected to disclose these
items. Additionally, a firm is expected to make these disclosures if it is highly
visible and is deemed to be accountable to society.

The first stage of this analysis is to examine how the two types of
DISCLOSURE (either social disclosure (SOCIALDISAR) or environmental
disclosure (ENVIRDISAR)) are correlated to the chosen independent variables.
These variables are: ROE (return on equity); ABIGOOD News and ABIBAD
News are as described earlier; LEVERAGE (the debt
to equity ratio);
NEWINEQ (new investment in fixed assets divided by common shareholders'
equity); EARN/FTEMPL (earnings divided by the number of
full-time
employees); FA/FTEMPL (net fixed assets divided by full-time employees);
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP (a dummy variable that is a 1 for Hydro-QueÂbec or BC
Hydro and 0 for TransAlta); and reliance on CAPITAL MARKETS (measured
using a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 (0 otherwise) for a firm in
any year where the debt-to-equity ratio has increased by at least 25 percent
which is deemed to be a major debt issue).

It is expected that as ROE, NEWINEQ, EARN/FTEMPL FA/FTEMPL, and
CAPITAL MARKETS increase, environmental and social disclosures increase.
When PUBLIC OWNERSHIP is a 1, then environmental and social disclosures
are expected to increase. As discussed in Cormier and Magnan (1999) these
variables proxy for proprietary costs and as such are expected to be positively
related to both environmental and social disclosures. That
is, more
environmental information will be disclosed where managers think the costs of
nondisclosure are higher than the costs of disclosure. In a political cost sense,
firms that have higher earnings, ROE or earnings per full-time employee may
be targets of environmental or other political groups.

LEVERAGE is expected to be negatively related to environmental and social
disclosures found in the annual reports. In this case disclosing environmental
and social information may indicate areas of increased proprietary costs for the
firm. Such costs could make credit negotiations more difficult and costly
because they indicate areas of firm risk.

The signs for ABIGOOD News and ABIBAD News are ambiguous. On the
one hand, where these disclosures have already been made public through the
media, there may be little reason to disclose them again in the annual reports.
On the other hand, once environmental and social disclosures are publicly
available including them in the annual report is unlikely to harm the company
further. Additionally, the tone of the firm's media exposure (i.e. the ``good
news/bad news'' nature of press reports about a specific firm) is likely to affect
a

reporting strategy. Thus, media

publications[10] is introduced as a control dimension in this analysis (i.e.
ABIGOOD News and ABIBAD News variables). Due to the exploratory nature
of the analysis, no directional predictions are made with respect to the
relationship between reporting of environmental performance and the firm's
environmental disclosures.

Social disclosures
From Table V, five independent variables are found to have significant
correlation coefficients with social disclosures (SOCIALDISAR). These
variables are ROE, ABIGOOD News, ABIBAD News, FA/FTEMPL, and
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. However, ROE has a negative sign instead of the
predicted positive sign.

As a sensitivity test, the sample was split into two sub-groups based on the
median of social disclosure (Table VI). For each variable, averages are
presented for the high disclosing group as well as for the low disclosing group.
Results support the findings from the correlation coefficients in Table V for
ROE, FA/FTEMPL, ABIGOOD News and PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. However,

ABIBAD News is no longer significant while EARN/FTEMPL becomes
significant[11].

Environmental disclosures
Using Table V and correlation coefficients, environmental disclosure
(ENVIRDISAR) is correlated with ROE, ABIGOOD News, FA/FTEMPL and
CAPITAL MARKETS. All four of these variables have the expected signs.

As a sensitivity test, the sample was again split into two sub-groups based
on the median of environmental disclosure (Table VII). For each variable,
averages are presented for the high disclosing group as well as the low
disclosing group. In terms of predicted direction of signs, results support those
presented in Table V. For the sensitivity results, the p-values for ABIGOOD
News and FA/FTEMPL are statistically significant[12].

Summary
Referring to variables that have both significant correlation coefficients and
passed the sensitivity test, social disclosures relate to ROE, ABIGOOD News,
FA/FTEMPL and PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. For environmental disclosures, ROE
and FA/FTEMPL are found to have both significant correlation coefficients
and pass the sensitivity analysis.

One interpretation of these findings is that firms have different targets when
making social as opposed to environmental disclosures. More social disclosures
are provided when ROE decreases, the firm is publicly owned, and the amount
of fixed assets compared to full time employees (FA/FTEMPL) increases. The
visibility of the firm as captured by the amount of, or increase in, fixed assets is
important. The ROE and PUBLIC OWNERSHIP variables
represent
accountability to a large number of stakeholders, those interested in the
efficiency of the firm and those concerned with how government owned
enterprises meet society's general objectives. We interpret this evidence to
mean that social disclosures are related to a need for legitimacy.

The positive relationship between environmental disclosures and ROE
indicates that
to decrease public pressure as ROE increases, more
environmental disclosures will be made. As found with social disclosures, as a

firm increases in size (FA/FTEMPL) or where it is publicly owned, the firm
becomes more visible and therefore, more accountable with respect
to
environmental issues. From this evidence, legitimacy seems to serve as an
explanation for these types of disclosure.

The univariate results from Tables V, VI and VII hint at another interesting
finding. Environmental disclosures seem to be more closely related to
information costs and benefits than do social disclosures. The predicted signs
of CAPITAL MARKETS and LEVERAGE indicate ENVIRDISAR is
associated with these variables as predicted. SOCIALDISAR's correlations
with CAPITAL MARKETS and LEVERAGE are opposite to predictions.
Employing regression analysis, further sensitivity tests are used to examine
the relationship between the types of disclosures (SOCIALDISAR or
ENVIRDISAR) and the independent variables (see Appendix 2). From the
regression analysis environmental disclosures seem to be more closely related
to information costs and benefits than do social disclosures confirming the
univariate results.

Conclusions and limitations
This paper provides evidence of two things. First, the publicly owned firms
disclosed more social and environmental information than did the privately
owned company. Second, these disclosures are related to the size of the
companies with the largest, Hydro-QueÂbec, providing the most information
and the smallest, TransAlta, providing the least. In this study, size is linked
to ownership status. Because the government owned enterprises are
politically supported and are large, they must make more disclosures due to
reasons of accountability and visibility as outlined in legitimacy theory.
Finally, while environmental disclosures appear to be related to information
costs and benefits, this relationship does not seem to hold for social
disclosures.

One important limitation is that regulation of electrical utilities in Canada is
a provincial jurisdiction. The three firms in this study come from three different
provinces and therefore are potentially faced with different rules and
regulations. Having noted this limitation, it is a limitation inherent in many
studies that have examined electric utilities from not only different states (e.g.
Fare et al., 1985) or provinces but also different countries.

A second limitation is that we examined two publicly owned firms and only
one privately owned firm. Because of the study time period, 1985 to 1996, there
were few privately owned electric utility companies in Canada. We chose the
largest private Canadian company to use in our comparisons and this company
was still smaller than the publicly owned firms. A future study might be able to
address this limitation by using different companies from a different
geographical setting.

A third limitation is the possible confounding effects of the variables we
have used in our study. In particular, confounding effects may result from the
companies' size, their production processes and ownership. As noted earlier in

the paper we have made efforts to control these effects in three ways. First, we
scale certain variables by the companies' total assets to control for size. Second,
we include a variable for ownership (PUBLIC OWNERSHIP) and third, we
employ firm effect variables (TRANSALTA and BC HYDRO) when
appropriate. However, confounding effects may still be present and affect the
conclusions drawn.

We suggest that future studies comparing publicly and privately owned
firms should examine effectiveness variables such as environmental and social
disclosures in addition to efficiency measures. Further, we think that
legitimacy theory, proprietary costs and information costs add to the
discussion and explanation of why firms with different ownership structures
have diverse reporting strategies.

Notes

1. Researcher bias is implied in such studies as Yunker (1975). In this study of US electric
utilities where no significant differences were found between public and private
companies, Yunker stated that ``. . . the public-private efficiency issue is only one small
part of the larger issue of socialism versus capitalism (Yunker, 1975, pp. 66-7, emphasis
added).

2. Some types of dissatisfaction have been identified by Van Maanen (1982, p. 13) and include
``the relatively trivial amount of explained variance, the abstract and remote character of
key variables, the lack of comparability across studies, the failure to achieve much
predictive value . . . and the causal complexity of multivariate analysis, which, even when
understood, makes change-oriented actions difficult to contemplate''.

3. Yin (1994, p. 117) outlined and explained the use of several different quantitative tools for
analyses including time series. The time series example cited by Yin used a small sample
size of four which is close to the sample size employed in this study.

4. This paragraph presents Gray et al.'s (1995) version of Lindblom's unpublished paper.
5. Gray et al. (1995, p. 54) argued that the second and fourth strategies are different. The
second strategy is in response to society's misperceptions while the fourth strategy results
from society's ``unrealistic'' or ``incorrect'' expectations of an organization's responsibilities.
This distinction remains somewhat unclear as ``misperception'' could result from either
``unrealistic'' or ``incorrect'' expectations.
In 1995 and 1996 Canadian firms began to anticipate decreasing regulation and increasing
competition in the North American electric utility industry. Evidence of this anticipation is
found in the Hydro-QueÂbec 1995 Annual Report (Hydro-QueÂbec, 1995, pp. 4-5) and in
TransAlta's 1996 Annual Report (TransAlta Corporation, 1996, p. 9).

6.

7. Of special note, for the 1985-1996 period TransAlta was also larger than the other
government owned electric utilities with the exception of Ontario-Hydro which ranked
second in size behind Hydro-QueÂbec.

8. While the production processes for the three companies differ, it should be noted that our
emphasis in this paper is on environmental effects which are broader than simply air
pollution. TransAlta's electricity production is primarily based on coal while BC Hydro's
and Hydro-QueÂbec's production is based primarily on hydro with some of Hydro-QueÂbec's
power generation based on nuclear power. Both BC Hydro and TransAlta generate
electricity using thermal and hydro production.

Coal-fired plants produce emissions that have been linked to acid rain and air pollution.
However, hydro-based production has negative environmental effects associated with it
that have resulted in calls to dismantle some dams (Fuhs, 2000; Reisner, 2000). These
environmental concerns are quite wide-ranging including the effects on fish habitats and

stocks (e.g. Pacific salmon), the effects on indigenious peoples and the damage to the eco-
systems in the area of the dams (Raphals, 1992; Ulrich, 1999; Volkman, 1992). Such high
profile dam projects as the High Aswan Dam (White, 1988) and the yet to be completed
Three Gorges project in China (Jhaveri, 1988) have also spurred environmental concerns.
Given these concerns, we think it makes sense to broadly examine environmental
disclosures for the three companies used in this study.

9. TransAlta did not disclose the number of full-time employees each year. The four missing
data points were estimated using disclosures from preceding and following years' annual
reports where this information was disclosed.

10. Examples of specialized publications include Electrical World, Energy Economist,
Canadian Business Review, Public Utility Fortnightly, Investment Dealers' Digest and
International Commercial Litigation.

11. A further sensitivity test was undertaken using multivariate analyses in the form of a pooled,
cross-sectional regression. The details of the regression are supplied in Appendix 2.
Controlling for firm specific effects and dropping EARN/FTEMPL which is highly correlated
with ROE renders FA/FTEMPL, and the two firm effect variables as significant with
ABIGOOD News somewhat significant in a two-tailed test. What this is interpreted to mean is
that social disclosures are related to the size of the organization and to media exposure.
12. As with social disclosure, a pooled, cross-sectional regression was run to test the
sensitivity of environmental disclosure to the independent variables. From Appendix 2 six
variables are found to be significant (ABIGOOD News, ABIBAD News, LEVERAGE,
NEWINEQ, CAPITAL MARKETS, and one firm specific variable.

Appendix 2
In Tables AI-AIII we provide the results from correlations between the independent
variables as well as from pooled, cross-sectional regressions. The regression equations are of
the form:

DISCLOSURE =

a + b1 (ROE) + b2 (ABIGOOD News) + b3 (ABIBAD News)
+ b4 (LEVERAGE) + b5 (NEWINEQ) + b6 (FA/FTEMPL)
+ b7 (CAPITAL MARKETS) + b8 (BC HYDRO) + b9 (TRANSALTA).

For the multivariate analyses in this Appendix, we use the information from the above
correlations to adjust the regression. In particular we drop EARN/FTEMPL from the analysis
due to high multicolinearity with ROE (variance of inflation at 20) as evidenced by its positive
and significant correlation with ROE. (The variance of inflation factor (VIF) for Xj is 1/1-RSQj,
where RSQj is the R-square from the regression of Xj on the remaining k-1 predictors. If Xj is
highly correlated with the remaining predictors, its VIF is very large.) PUBLIC OWNERSHIP

firm effect. The first of the two dummy variables takes on a value of one for BC Hydro and
zero otherwise and the second takes on a value of one for TransAlta and a zero otherwise.
From the social disclosure regression, the independent variables explain 83.4 percent of the
variance in the dependent variable (SOCIALDISAR). The signs of the independent variables are
as expected except for LEVERAGE. ABIBAD News was included in the regression despite its
lack of significance in comparing publicly owned versus privately owned firms as shown in
Table II. This inclusion was meant to ensure that all media exposure (good and bad) was
represented.

In this multivariate setting, FA/FTEMPL and the firm specific effects are significant while
ABIGOOD News has some statistical significance (p < 0.189 two-tailed). These results confirm
the univariate analyses presented in Table VI. The only difference in the multivariate and
univariate analyses is a surprising lack of significance for the ROE variable. ROE is significant
when the publicly owned and privately owned comparison is made in Tables II and VI. Despite
this significance, ROE is not found to be significant in explaining the dependent variable
SOCIALDISAR. The variable EARN/FTEMPL is dropped from the regression due to high
multicolinearity with ROE.

Dependent variable is environmental disclosures as contained in the annual report

From the second equation in this appendix, the independent variables explain 73.6 percent of
the variance in the dependent variable (ENVIRDISAR). ABIBAD News was included in the
regression despite its lack of significance in comparing publicly owned versus privately
owned firms as shown in Table II. As with the social disclosure regression, this inclusion was
meant to ensure that all media exposure (good and bad) was represented. All signs of the
independent variables are as expected with the exception of ROE and FA/FTEMPL.
ABIGOOD News and ABIBAD News as well as LEVERAGE, NEWINEQ, CAPITAL
MARKETS and the BC HYDRO firm effect variable are significant at a 0.07 level. Again, the
variable EARN/FTEMPL is dropped from the regression due to high multicolinearity with
ROE.

The amount of fixed assets (a size variable) compared to equity (NEWINEQ) and the BC
Hydro variable positively relate to increased environmental disclosures. Also the positive sign
for CAPITAL MARKETS indicates where a firm wishes to issue additional debt (CAPITAL
MARKETS), more environmental reporting will result. However, as LEVERAGE increases
environmental disclosures decrease and smaller firms (e.g. TransAlta) make less environmental
disclosures than larger firms.

Unlike social disclosures, environmental disclosures seem to be influenced by the level of
indebtedness (LEVERAGE) and the need for new financing (CAPITAL MARKETS). This is
interpreted to mean that environmental disclosures reduce the level of information asymmetry
between managers and investors. This same reduction in information asymmetry does not seem
to occur with social disclosures. That is, social disclosures appear to be unrelated to CAPITAL
MARKETS, LEVERAGE or ROE.
