Causality Between Corporate Social
Performance and Financial Performance:
Evidence from Canadian Firms

Rim Makni

ABSTRACT. This study assesses the causal relationship
between corporate social performance (CSP) and financial
performance (FP). We perform our empirical analyses on
a sample of 179 publicly held Canadian firms and use the
measures of CSP provided by Canadian Social Investment
Database for
the years 2004 and 2005. Using the
‘‘Granger causality’’ approach, we find no significant
relationship between a composite measure of a firm’s CSP
and FP, except
for market returns. However, using
individual measures of CSP, we find a robust significant
negative impact of the environmental dimension of CSP
and three measures of FP, namely return on assets, return
on equity, and market returns. This latter finding is
consistent, at least in the short run, with the trade-off
hypothesis and,
in part, with the negative synergy
hypothesis which states that socially responsible firms
experience lower profits and reduced shareholder wealth,
which in turn limits the socially responsible investments.

Introduction

academic

researchers

Business ethics in Canada has been shaped by dif-
ferent players: Canadian society in general, activism
from religious groups and other institutional or
ethical investors. In addition, the growing interest
of
the Canadian
accounting profession has also facilitated its devel-
opment (Brooks, 1997). Furthermore, the intro-
Investment
duction
Database (CSID) developed by Michael
Jantzi
Research Associates (MJRA) provides researchers
with a new and improved means to quantify cor-

in this area

‘‘CSP research has employed a variety of theories
and methodologies to study the potential relation-
ship between corporate social responsibility activi-
ties and other
traditional measures of a ﬁrm’s
success’’ (Mahoney and Roberts, 2007, p. 234). In
addition to large-scale American empirical research,
some researchers have examined the relationship
between CSP and ﬁnancial performance (FP) in
other contexts
including the Canadian context.
Contrary to the US study by Waddock and Graves
(1997); Mahoney and Roberts (2007) found no
signiﬁcant relationship between a composite mea-
sure of CSP and FP for Canadian ﬁrms. However,
their ﬁndings do indicate a signiﬁcant relationship
between individual measures of a ﬁrm’s CSP
regarding environmental and international activities
and FP. This study examined only one direction of
causality, i.e. from CSP to FP.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the causal
relationship between the ﬁrm’s CSP and FP, using
the Granger causality approach (Granger, 1969). As
in Mahoney and Roberts (2007), our results do not
show a consistent statistically signiﬁcant relationship
between the aggregate measure of a ﬁrm’s CSP and
all FP measures. However, contrary to this Canadian
study, our ﬁndings do suggest a signiﬁcant negative
impact of the environmental dimension of CSP on
FP. High ratings of social performance in terms of
environmental activities ‘‘Granger causes’’ lower levels
of ﬁnancial performance. Our ﬁndings are robust to
three measures of performance, ROA, ROE and
stock market returns and to the inclusion of several
control variables that are known to have an impact
on CSP and FP.

Our contribution to the literature on CSP is
twofold. First, our paper extends prior large-scale
American studies of causality between CSP and FP,
by utilizing data on publicly held Canadian ﬁrms.
Second, our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the
causality links between CSP and FP in Canada.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-
lows. In the next section, we examine the ‘‘Theo-
retical framework’’ regarding the CSP-FP link. The
third section describes our ‘‘Research methodol-
ogy’’. In the fourth section, we present the ‘‘results’’
of the study, followed by the ‘‘Conclusions’’ in the
last section.

Theoretical framework

Literature review

Preston and O’Bannon (1997) have distinguished
between the direction of the CSP-FP relationship
(positive, negative or neutral)
and the causal
sequence: does CSP inﬂuence FP, does FP inﬂuence
CSP, or is there a synergistic relationship between
the two? They have developed six possible causal
and directional hypotheses: social impact hypothesis,
slack resources hypothesis,
trade-off hypothesis,
managerial opportunism hypothesis, positive synergy
hypothesis and negative synergy hypothesis.

The social

impact hypothesis is based on the
stakeholder theory which suggests that meeting the
needs of various corporate stakeholders will lead to
favourable FP (Freeman, 1984). According to this
hypothesis,
stake-
holders enhances a company’s reputation in a way
that has a positive impact on its FP. Conversely,
disappointing these groups of stakeholders may have
a negative ﬁnancial impact (Preston and O’Bannon,
1997).

serving the implicit claims of

The slack resource hypothesis predicts that better
FP potentially results in the availability of slack
resources that may increase a ﬁrm’s ability to invest
in socially responsible domains such as community
and society, employee relations or environment
(Waddock and Graves, 1997).
The trade-off hypothesis

supposes a negative
impact of CSP on FP. This hypothesis deals with the
neoclassical economists’ position which holds that
socially responsible behaviour will net few economic

beneﬁts while its numerous costs will reduce proﬁts
and shareholder wealth (Waddock and Graves,
1997). ‘‘This hypothesis reﬂects the classic Friedman
position and is supported by the well-known early
ﬁnding of Vance (1975) that corporations displaying
strong social credentials experience declining stock
prices relative to the market average’’ (Preston and
O’Bannon, 1997, p. 421).

to

According

the managerial

opportunism
hypothesis, corporate managers may pursue their
own private objectives to the detriment of both
shareholders and other stakeholders (Weidenbaum
and Sheldon, 1987; Williamson, 1967, 1985). In
fact, when FP is strong, managers may reduce social
expenditures in order to maximize their own short-
term private gains. Conversely, when FP weakens,
managers may engage in conspicuous social pro-
grams in order to offset their disappointing results
(Preston and O’Bannon, 1997).

the possibility of

The positive synergy hypothesis supposes that
higher levels of CSP lead to an improvement of FP,
which offers
in
socially responsible actions (Allouche and Laroche,
2005a). Indeed, favourable CSP leads to a surplus of
available funds (social impact hypothesis) which is
reallocated,
to the different stakeholders
(slack resources hypothesis). There may then be a
simultaneous
relation
between CSP and FP,
forming a virtuous circle
(Waddock and Graves, 1997).

However, according to the negative synergy
hypothesis, higher levels of CSP lead to decreased
FP, which in turn limits the socially responsible
investments. There may then be a simultaneous and
interactive negative relation between CSP and FP,
forming a vicious circle.

While empirical results concerning the nature of
the relationship between CSP and FP continue to be
mixed, the largest number of investigations found a
positive relationship. This
the
positivism of the CSP-FP link is supported by sub-
sequent meta-analysis
and Laroche,
2005b; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006).

tendency towards

(Allouche

Another vein of research focused on the causal
relationship between CSP and FP. For instance,
using traditional statistical techniques, Waddock and
Graves (1997) and Hillman and Keim (2001) ﬁnd a
positive synergistic relationship between CSP and
FP showing the existence of a virtuous circle

between the two constructs. McGuire et al. (1988)
ﬁnd that lagged FP measures lead to improved cur-
rent CSP measures, but the latter does not affect FP.
In a more recent study, Nelling and Webb (2006)
examine the causal relationship between CSP and FP
by introducing a new econometric technique, the
Granger causality approach. Their ﬁndings suggest
that, using ordinary least square (OLS) regression
models, CSP and FP are related. In disagreement
with prior empirical research, they ﬁnd a lower
relationship between CSP and FP when employing a
time series ﬁxed effects approach. The same result is
found when introducing Granger causality models.
Furthermore, by focusing on individual measures of
CSP, they ﬁnd causality running from stock market
performance to CSP ratings regarding employee’s
relationships.

studies, Mahoney and Roberts

In addition to those large-scale American empiri-
(2007) have
cal
examined the relationship between CSP and FP in
the Canadian context. This study has examined the
relationship between these constructs using the CSID
measure of CSP.1 Contrary to Waddock and Graves
(1997), Mahoney and Roberts (2007) found no sig-
niﬁcant relationship between a composite measure of
a ﬁrm’s CSP and FP. However, using a one-year lag,
their ﬁndings indicate a signiﬁcant positive relation-
ship between individual measures of a ﬁrm’s CSP

regarding environmental and international activities
and FP. This study has examined only one direction
of causality: from CSP to FP.

Conceptual model

Past research falls short of showing a clear causal
relationship between FP and CSP. Our study aims at
testing the following hypothesis by using the Gran-
ger causality approach, and by considering exoge-
nous factors that could mitigate this relationship:

H1: Higher (lower) levels of ﬁnancial performance
(corporate social performance) Granger cause
higher (lower) levels of corporate social per-
formance (ﬁnancial performance).

Figure 1 illustrates our conceptual model. The fol-
lowing CSP dimensions are assessed in an aggregate
CSP score and individually: community and society,
corporate governance, customers, employees, environment
and human rights. Financial performance is measured
by two accounting ratios, ROA and ROE and stock
market returns. Control variables that are known to
have an impact on CSP and FP, namely size, risk and
industry, are included in the statistical models to
better isolate the effect of CSP and FP.

Research methodology

Sample

The sample used in this study is drawn from the
CSID for the years 2004 and 2005. The framework
for tracking and reporting on corporate social and
environmental performance includes a set of social
and environmental indicators carefully developed by
MJRA. This framework is based largely on a stake-
holder model and is similar in many ways to the
framework used by the SiRi2 Network, of which
MJRA is a founding member. To further establish
the credibility of MJRA, it is worth noting that it has
a longstanding research partnership with KLD
Research & Analytics, Inc., a worldwide renowned
ﬁrm providing environmental,
social and gover-
nance data to researchers outside of Canada. There
were 222 companies listed for the year 2004 and 276
companies for the year 2005. CSP ratings were
available for 179 companies for both 2004 and 2005.
Missing values are attributed mostly to income funds
and trusts.

Variables

Corporate social performance
For the years 2004 and 2005 we use two measures of
CSP developed by MJRA. First, we use the aggre-
gate score of CSP. As researchers are now investi-
gating the effects of individual dimension variables
within the KLD and the CSID databases, we per-
form our empirical tests using ratings for each of the
dimensions (community and society, corporate governance,
employees, environment, customers and human rights) as
separate variables.

Financial performance
Following Mahoney and Roberts (2007), return on
assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) were used
separately to measure a ﬁrm’s FP. For robustness, we
used stock market returns as an additional criterion.
Data on ROA and ROE were derived from the
Stock Guide database. Market returns were obtained
from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) through
the Canadian Financial Market Research Center
(CFMRC) database.

In fact,

Control variables
Some difference in CSP and FP may result from
ﬁrm size, ﬁrm risk and industry and need to be
operationalized as control variables (Mahoney and
Roberts, 2007; Ullman, 1985; Waddock and
Graves, 1997).
smaller ﬁrms may not
exhibit as much overt socially responsible behav-
iour as do larger ﬁrms
(Waddock and Graves,
1997). Furthermore, less risky ﬁrms have a stable
return model and invest, consequently, in socially
responsible activities (Roberts, 1992). In addition,
earlier research has shown that clear differences in
performance and R&D investment exist among
different
industries (Graves and Waddock, 1994;
Waddock and Graves, 1997). Size and systematic
risk are also well-known determinants of FP (Fama
and French, 1992, 1993).

Firm size was measured using the natural loga-
rithm of total assets. As a proxy for the riskiness of
a ﬁrm, we used the long-term debt to total assets
ratio and the beta factor. TSX industries are
accounted for in our models by dummy variables.
All control variables were obtained for the year
2004. Firm size and debt level were derived from
the Stock Guide database. Beta factors, calculated on
a ﬁve-year basis, were obtained from the TSX -
CFMRC.

Statistical analyses
We address the link between FP and CSP in the
context of Granger causality (Granger, 1969). This
approach, applied to our context with two years of
data, involves the following two-variable regression
models (Gujarati, 1995):

simple causal model as opposed to the instanta-
neous causal model where FP in year 2005 is
included as an independent variable in Model (1)
and CSP in year 2005 in Model (2).

The ordinary least squares (OLS) method is used
to estimate the regression coefﬁcients in Models (1)
and (2) and to test for Granger causality. The two-
variable regression equations (1) and (2) are ﬁt sep-
arately for all combinations of the CSP dimensions
(aggregate CSP score, community and society, corporate
governance, employees, environment, customers and human
rights) with each one of
the three FP measures
(ROA, ROE, and stock market returns). Because
we do not hypothesize a direction for the causality
(positive or negative), we use a two-sided test for
coefﬁcients a2 and b2 in Models
(1) and (2),
respectively. Statistical signiﬁcance is set at 5%. All
statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.1 for
Windows.

Results

Descriptive statistics of the sample and simple correlation
analysis

Table I presents the descriptive statistics of CSP and
FP measures and of the control variables. The means
of the aggregate CSP score are 4.72 and 4.77 for
2005 and 2004, respectively. The means for the
different CSP dimensions vary between 2.75 and
6.67 and, as for the aggregate CSP, they do not differ
much between 2004 and 2005. Stock market returns
were not available for 11 ﬁrms in our sample, so the
analyses for that particular FP measures are based on
a sample size of 168 observations. The average
compounded stock market returns for 2005 and
2004 are 0.14 and 0.40, respectively. The mean
ROA is 0.03 for both years and the mean ROE is
0.09 in 2005 and 0.07 in 2004.

*Granger causality test is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level or lower.

The Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between the
CSP and FP measures in 2005 with CSP, FP and the
control variables in 2004 are given in Table II. In
general,
the CSP and FP measures in 2005 are
positively and strongly correlated with their corre-
sponding CSP and FP measures in year 2004. Fur-
thermore, except for the customer and human rights
dimensions, the other CSP dimensions are strongly
correlated with the aggregate CSP score and they are
also correlated with each other.

measures, respectively. According to Models (1) and
(2) in Section ‘‘Statistical analyses’’,
the primary

independent variables are CSP and FP in 2004, the
latter being measured either by compounded stock
market returns, ROA and ROE. The natural loga-
rithm of total assets, debt level, beta factor in 2004
and industry are included as control variables in both
models. Because there were only 3 paper-sector
ﬁrms (Table I) whose averages for the CSP and FP
measures were not statistically different from the
average scores of the ﬁrms in the metals and minerals
sector, ﬁrms in all these industries were pooled and
were arbitrarily used as the reference category in the
regression models.

We ﬁnd for Model (1) in Tables III, IV and V that
the relationship between the aggregate CSP score in
2005 and the three FP measures in 2004 are not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant. Therefore, FP does not ‘‘Granger
cause’’ CSP. As for the second model, we have a
statistically signiﬁcant negative relationship between
the aggregate CSP score in 2004 and stock market
returns in 2005 (p = 0.024, Table III). This suggests a

*Granger causality test is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level or lower.

unidirectional ‘‘Granger causal’’ relationship between
the aggregate CSP score and stock market returns: a
higher overall corporate social performance ‘‘Granger
causes’’ a lower market return on average. The rela-
tionships between the aggregate CSP score in 2004
with ROA and ROE in 2005 are however not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (see Tables IV and V).

It is also worth noting that the results from the
causality speciﬁcations using the aggregate CSP as the
dependent variable show very high R2 (91%). This is
mainly due to the very strong association between
2005 and 2004 CSP scores (Table II), suggesting little
variation in these scores over that two-year period.

Results of the different CSP dimensions

Rather than focusing on the composite measure
of CSP,
some authors examined the individual
dimensions of CSP (e.g. Fisman et al., 2005; Hillman

(e.g.

and Keim, 2001; Nelling and Webb, 2006). The
ﬁndings of Hillman and Keim (2001) indicate that
the restricted CSP measure linked to stakeholder
management
shareholders, employees, cus-
tomers) is associated with FP. In addition, Fisman
et al. (2005) ﬁnd that the individual measure of CSP
regarding community positively affects FP in
advertising-intensive industries. Furthermore, Nel-
ling and Webb (2006) test the relationship between
FP and individual measures of CSP and ﬁnd that the
only aspect of CSP driven by ﬁnancial performance
is ‘employee relations’.

In the present study, we examine the relationship
between FP and individual measures of CSP derived
from the CSID (community and society, corporate gov-
ernance, employees, customers, environment and human
rights). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁt the regression Models (1)
and (2) six different times by substituting the CSP
score of community and society, corporate governance,
employees, customers, environment and human rights for

CSP. We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant relationship
between the CSP individual measures and the FP
measures except for environment and employee. Hence,
only the regression results with these latter two
dimensions are presented in more detail here.3
Results for the employee CSP score are similar to those
of the aggregate CSP score, i.e. there is a statistically
signiﬁcant negative association in Model (2) between
the employee CSP score in 2004 and stock market
returns in 2005 (p = 0.038), and this latter signiﬁcant
association is not observed with ROA and ROE.

testing

‘‘Granger

Tables VI, VII and VIII present the results of the

regression models
between the CSP environment score and market re-
turns, ROA, and ROE, respectively. There is no
statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the three
FP measures in 2004 and the CSP environment score
in 2005; the p-values are 0.489, 0.162 and 0.319 for
market returns, ROA, and ROE, respectively. On
the other hand, there is a statistically signiﬁcant and

negative relationship of the 2004 CSP environment
score with the 2005 stock market returns (p = 0.002,
Table VI) and also with the 2005 ROA (p = 0.028,
Table VII). The negative relationship with ROE in
2005 is close to being statistically signiﬁcant at the
5% level
(p = 0.059, Table VIII), which gives
robustness to our results. Hence, the ﬁnding of an
unidirectional and negative ‘‘Granger causal’’ rela-
tionship between the CSP environment score and the
FP measures supports the trade-off hypothesis and,
in part, the negative synergy hypothesis.4 Indeed,
our ﬁndings suggest a negative impact of CSP envi-
ronment score on FP measures but the latter does not
affect CSP.

Conclusions

This study was undertaken to investigate the causal
relationship between CSP and FP in Canadian ﬁrms.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to examine
causal relationships in a Canadian setting.

According to Mahoney and Roberts (2007) but
contrary to Waddock and Graves (1997) our results
suggest no signiﬁcant
relationship between the
aggregated CSP score and FP, except for market
returns. This latter ﬁnding is mainly driven by the
statistically signiﬁcant results of the environment and
employee dimensions of CSP. However, we ﬁnd a
robust unidirectional and negative ‘‘Granger causal’’
relationship between the environmental dimension
of CSP and all three FP measures, which is consis-
tent with the trade-off hypothesis and, in part, with
the negative synergy hypothesis which states that
socially responsible ﬁrms experience lower proﬁts
and reduced shareholder wealth, which in turn limits
the socially responsible investments.

Regulatory compliance, management systems and
good control of resources and pollution should,
theoretically, create a social
reputation amongst

stakeholders that will eventually enhance ﬁnancial
performance. However, our results show that cor-
porate social initiatives in Canada, especially envi-
ronmental programmes, lead to poor performance in
the short term. Compared to large US corporations,
Canadian ﬁrms are relatively small
in size. Envi-
ronmental initiatives appear too costly and do not
seem to be considered as sound investments by the
Canadian market. Government subsidies may be
necessary to compensate for the short-term negative
impact on ﬁnancial performance that these ﬁrms
suffer. Firms and policy makers can use the results of
this
study to understand the short run ﬁnancial
implications of making environmental
spending
decisions and improve corporate environmental
disclosure in Canada. Although our results show that
a better environmental performance is associated
with poor short run FP, as Ambec and Lanoie (2007)
argue, augmented environmental expenses could
be compensated in the long run by increases in

revenues through a better access to certain markets,
the possibility to differentiate products and sell
pollution-control technology and the reductions of
costs related to regulations, material,
labour and
capital market.

These results must be interpreted with some
limitations in mind. First, the CSP measures used in
the analyses are subject to the limitations inherent in
the measurement of CSP activities. Indeed, although
an independent ﬁrm performs the CSID ratings,
they are based on this ﬁrm’s deﬁnition and evalua-
tion of CSP. Second, our analysis takes into account
only the years 2004 and 2005. Further studies should
aim at evaluating the long-term relation existing
between CSP and FP.

authors acknowledged the limitations of their approach

The residuals analysis did not show departures from the
OLS assumptions for any of the ﬁtted models. How-
ever, we found only a few outlying observations for the
FP measures. We did the ‘‘Granger causality’’ analyses
without these few outlying observations, and we ob-
tained similar results that do not change the conclu-
sions. For example,
the p-value associated with the
negative regression coefﬁcient of the CSP environment
score in 2004 with each one of the three dependent FP
measures in 2005 was even lower and reaches statistical
signiﬁcance for ROE (p = 0.001 for market returns in
2005, p = 0.004 for ROA in 2005 and p = 0.010 for
ROE in 2005).
