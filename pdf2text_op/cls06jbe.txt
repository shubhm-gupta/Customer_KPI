 ABSTRACT. Different theoretical approaches highlight
 the growing relevance of corporate reputation as strategic
 factor. Among these approaches the arguments of the
 Resource-Based View are special worthwhile (Grant,
 1991, California Management Review 33(3), 114-135;
 Barney, 1999, Sloan Management Review Spring, 137
 145). Nevertheless, this topic poses several methodolog
 ical problems (Barney et al., 2001), as the unavailability to
 identify and measure this organizational factor, that is
 "sociaUy complex" and intangible in its nature. In this
 work, using the findings of our empirical research on
 Spanish biotechnology firms, we carry out an identifica
 tion and measurement of corporate reputation, high

 Introduction

 Nowadays, a good corporate reputation is one ofthe
 main business assets responsible of sustained financial
 outcomes (Roberts and Dowling, 2002). This stra
 tegic potential is due to its own value-creation
 capability, and to its intangible character, because it
 makes corporate reputation quite hardly to imitate by
 competitors, aUowing to maintain a superior posi
 tion. In the present day, we can state that business
 management researchers and speciaUy researchers
 from the Resource-Based View (Barney, 1986,1991;
 Deephouse, 2000; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Grant,
 1991) have highlighted its strategic nature.

 Although the intangible nature is a key charac
 teristic in order to grant its relevance, it also makes
 very hard to perform a conceptual delimitation,
 characterization, and measurement (Deephouse,
 2000). Corporate reputation holds a complex nature
 (Barney, 1986; Dowling, 2001; Grant, 1991). Its
 triggers are deeply rooted in the own organization,
 and they are tied to its creation and evolution, in an
 unique historicaUy dependent context (Dierickx and
 Cool, 1989). Thus, corporate reputation becomes
 highly specific for each firm. This can be one of the
 main reasons because there are so little effort in
 studying a conceptual and empirical delimitation of
 this asset (Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997). In
 this vein, we must highlight that most of the

 empirical research that tries to relate corporate rep
 utation and competitive advantage, the information
 sources employed are mainly secondary (Deephouse,
 2000; DeQuevedo, 2001). Among other things, this
 fact is due to the problems that researchers find to
 make it operative.

 Taking into account these problems, this work
 provides a conceptual delimitation of corporate
 reputation, as weU as an identification of its main
 dimensions: business reputation and social reputa
 tion, and a measurement for it in order to determine
 its nature empiricaUy, and to aUow its measurement.
 In order to carry out this task, our work is built
 upon the foUowing main sections: (i) conceptual
 delimitation; (ii) identification ofthe main underly
 ing dimensions: business reputation and social repu
 tation; and (iii) the main conclusions ofthe study.

 The notion of corporate reputation

 Trying to conceptualize corporate reputation,
 Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar (1997) provide a syn
 thesis and comparison of how it has been treated from
 the fields of Sociology, Marketing, Law, Accoun
 tancy, Economics, and Business Management.
 Within the field of Business Management, there are
 several contributions around corporate reputation.
 Although it has been a quite common topic in the
 literature, there is no agreement about what does it
 mean and what does it include. The work of
 Groenland (2002) tries to give some guidelines, de
 spite ofthe fact that the own author could found in its
 empirical qualitative research (2002: 309), "corporate
 reputation is, in its essence, a mainly emotional
 concept that is difficult to rationalize and to explicit".
 From the review of the different contributions

 (Baden-FuUer et al., 2000; Deephouse, 2000; De
 Quevedo, 2001; DoUinger et al., 1997; Fombrun,
 1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Groenland,
 2002; Petric et al, 1999; Rao, 1994; Shenkar and
 Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997; Roberts and Dowling, 2002;
 Weigelt and Camerer, 1988), as weU as from the
 characteristics provided by Fombrun and Van Reil
 (1997), we can pose that corporate reputation is the
 result ofthe process of "social legitimization" ofthe
 firm. In this sense, we can understand corporate
 reputation as the coUective representation of actions
 and outcomes of the past and present of the orga

 nization, that describe its capability to obtain valu
 able outcomes for different stakeholders.

 The former definition is quite close to the one of
 Barney's (1999), who remarks the characteristics tied
 to organizational capabilities ? an unique historical
 context, path dependence, social complexity, and
 causal ambiguity. These characteristics make them
 difficult to create or accumulate, and corporate rep
 utation is pointed out as a clear example of aU of this.
 The present reputation of a certain firm is built or
 accumulated in a historical context and in unique
 circumstances that surely can not be repeated.
 Besides, as HaU (1992) argues, his survey among
 British managers shows that firm reputation and
 product reputation need several years to be shaped.
 This makes clear that the reputation is one of the
 most difficult to accumulate resources. Dierickx and
 Cool (1989) argue that, in order to obtain a good
 reputation, several decisions about operations,
 quality, etc. are needed.

 From the provided definition and the main

 characteristics that it includes - causal ambiguity,
 social complexity, slow accumulation, and path
 dependence - we can find that corporate reputation
 shows a high rate of tacitness and intangibility, and
 this makes its identification and measurement reaUy
 hard. We address this issue in the next section.

 Social reputation and business reputation as
 a key components of corporate reputation:
 empirical evidence

 Several authors highlight the complexity ? and the
 multicHmensionality - of corporate reputation. Pre
 cisely Barney (1999) argues that reputation is a
 "sociaUy complex" capability. These sociaUy com
 plex phenomena, as stated firstly in 1991, are out of
 reach for firm ability in order to get a complete
 influence and management, as Standifird (2001) says.
 Deephouse (2000) points out that corporate repu
 tation is developed through time, with a socially
 complex process in which the firm and its stake
 holders - internal and external - are involved.

 In this sense, there are not agreements about its
 conceptual delimitation. One of the most discordant
 points refers to its multidimensionality (Fombrun and
 Shanley, 1990). DoUinger et al. (1997) point out the
 multidimensionality of this construct, identifying

 three main components for reputation: managerial
 reputation, financial reputation, and product repu
 tation. These dimensions are independent and rep
 resent different aspects of corporate reputation and
 their role with different stakeholders.

 From a Stakeholders Framework, another inter
 esting proposal is due to De Quevedo (2001). In her
 research, she highlights the existence of two main
 dimensions of corporate reputation: internal repu
 tation and external reputation. The first one is
 related with the "business stakeholders" perception
 of firm activities - workers, managers, shareholders,
 customers, aUies, suppliers - and the second one is
 related with the external stakeholders perception of
 firm activities ? society in general. These findings are
 similar to Deephouse's (2000) work.

 The previous comments lead us to the determi
 nation of the multidimensionality of corporate rep
 utation as we have defined it, from the analysis ofthe
 composition and relations of each of the elements
 that configure corporate reputation (Fombrun,
 1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). These elements
 are: (i) managerial quality; (ii) financial strength; (iii)
 product and service quality; (iv) innovation; (v) use
 of corporate assets/efficiency; (vi) capability to
 gather, develop, and retain talented people; (vii)

 social responsibility among the community; and
 (viii) value of long term investments.
 With the purpose to deepen into the data about
 the elements of corporate reputation we carried out
 a survey. It was sent to CEO of Spanish biotech
 nology firms. FoUowing Rouse and DaeUenbach
 (1999), the use of a single industry is a necessary
 condition to explore intrinsic and complex organi
 zational factors responsible of business success.
 During 2003 our field research reached a response
 rate of 58% of the population (n=34 cases).

 Then, we performed a factor analysis in order to
 identify the configuration of those elements. The
 correlation matrix (Table I) will show the appro
 priateness of this analysis. As it can be clearly
 appreciated, almost every correlation is positive,
 strong and significant, which constitutes a first sign
 of factor analysis appropriateness.

 This appropriateness is supported by the Bartlett
 test, which aUows to refuse the hypothesis that the
 correlation matrix would be an identity matrix, and
 the Kaiser?Meyer?Olkin index, holds a value near
 to one (Table II). AU of these tests claim for the
 appropriateness of factor analysis in this case.

 Now we proceed to extracting the factor axis, as

 weU as to interpret the results of Table III.

 This fact makes necessary to detect the possible

 existence of a financial halo in our measurement. If
 its presence is confirmed, we wiU try to eUminate it

 as financial bias index, and measured reputation as

 ponent of corporate reputation can be summarised in
 one factor that explains 69% of the standard devia
 tion of the original data. The results of Table III, as
 weU as the high correlations among the elements of
 reputation confirm the conclusions of Fombrun and
 Shanley (1990), although they obtained a factor that
 counts for the 84% of the standard deviation from
 the elements of reputation according to Fortune data.
 The previous results confirm the suspicions of
 financial bias in measuring reputation, a traditional
 issue in this kind of research (Brown and Perry,
 1994; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; McGuire et al.,
 1990). This financial halo or bias represents that the
 assessments of the different elements of corporate
 reputation are interpreted taking into account the
 economic and financial performance of the firm.

 bias can be assessed using the results shown in
 Table III. As we have commented above, the eight
 elements of corporate reputation contribute to an
 only factor that explains almost the 69% of the
 standard deviation ofthe original data. Although this
 figure does not reach the 80% obtained by De
 Quevedo (2001), we can conclude that there is a
 clear sign of the existence of financial halo.

 participants are general managers and industry
 experts, whom are mainly worried about financial
 issues. This leads them to answer to the rest of
 elements of corporate reputation in a similar way.

 financial halo index must be created in order to

 variables: (i) average ROA of the last 3 years; (ii)
 market value over book value of the firm; (iii) sales
 log; (iv) medium increase of sales during the last
 3 years; and (v) risk, measured as the relation be
 tween debts and investment. The results of this work
 show a portion of the standard deviation of the
 dependent variable ? the set ofthe eight components
 of corporate reputation - explained by the financial
 halo index of 55%, higher than the detected by
 McGuire et al. (1990) or Fombrun and Shanley
 (1990). Nevertheless, the methodology developed
 by Brown and Perry (1994) propose to perform nine
 multiple regressions, one for each element of repu
 tation, and one more for the global reputation of
 each firm.

 Because of the specific characteristics of Spanish
 biotechnology industry, speciaUy because its emer
 gent state (according to the Asebio Report 2002,
 40% of firms are younger than 2-years-old, and none
 ofthe firms ofthe sample was a public company), we
 decide to create the index according to the foUowing
 concepts: (i) average ROA ofthe last 2 years (2001
 and 2000); (ii) 2001 sales log; (iii) medium increase
 of sales during 2001 and 2000; and (iv) risk taken in
 2001, measured as debts over total liabilities.

 As a preliminary step to making the appropriate
 multiple regression analysis, in Table IV we show the
 correlations among the variables included in the study.

 Then, in Table V, the results of the nine regres

 sions performed (one for each component of repu
 tation, and one for global reputation) are shown.
 Each regression has been run over the total of our
 sample, according to the foUowing general expres
 sion for the regression equation:

 Element = ft + ftAVROA + ftRISKOl

 + ftSALELGOl + ftSALEINCR + e

 Where, AVROA: average ROA during the years 2000
 and 2001; RISK01: financial risk taken in 2001 (total
 investment over total liabilities); SALELG01: 2001 sales
 log; SALEINCR: the average sales increase in 2001 with
 respect to 2000.

 Lastly, we show the residue ofthe estimation that
 represents the value of each component of corporate
 reputation free from financial bias.

 The results ofthe nine previous regressions show
 a clear presence of financial halo, due to the fact that
 every regression holds high regression coefficients,

 significant for acceptance values (Table V). Those
 values are coherent with the results obtained and
 validated by Brown and Perry (1994).

 Once the financial halo has been detected, we must
 try to correct it. FoUowing the methodology proposed
 by Brown and Perry (1994), once the financial halo has
 been detected, with high and significant R , we must
 eliminate it from the components of reputation. In
 doing so, we accept that the residues obtained from the
 regression, namely, the portion of component that is
 not explained by the financial halo index, are the
 measurement of the components of corporate repu
 tation without financial halo.

 From these residues or components without
 financial halo, we run a new factor analysis to
 determine the dimensions of corporate reputation
 (see Table VI).

 Then, we proceed to extract the factorial axis, as

 weU as to discuss the results shown in Table VII.

 FoUowing the factor weight pattern we wiU

 interpret the obtained factors.

 The first factor can be understood as the corporate
 reputation related to the main issues of the core
 business. This way, the component that holds a
 higher correlation with this factor is product and
 service quality, followed by the innovation degree of
 the firm. Besides, this factor includes elements
 related to investment value in the long run, the
 efficiency in the use of corporate assets, and the
 capability to attract, develop and retain talented
 workers.

 The second factor shows important weights of the
 two variables or components that it includes:
 financial strength, and social and green firm
 responsibility. Once the financial bias has been
 corrected, it seems coherent that social responsibility
 will be apart from the rest of components of cor
 porate reputation. The lack of separation between
 this element and the rest was exactly the beginnings
 of the debate about the presence and correction of
 financial bias in the literature (Brown and Perry,
 1994; DiUon et al., 1984). Thus, this result support
 previous works and shows a new proof of bias cor
 rection.

 Nevertheless, there is an interesting issue about
 the inclusion of this element in the second factor,
 with financial strength. It seems appropriate of
 financial strength to hold weak ties with the repu
 tation about product and service quality, or with

 innovation rates. Nevertheless, to appear with firm
 social responsibility can be explained. A priori,
 according with the responses of the managers from
 this industry, social and green responsibility was the
 last element of corporate reputation ranked by rel
 evance (it counted for 7% of global reputation).
 Thus, managers wiU only aUocate resources to social
 responsibility when financial surplus will be avail
 able. This idea supports to include both elements
 together in the second factor, that we named "social
 reputation".

 The second issue in determining complexity
 degree, exogenous complexity, takes into account
 the number of resources and capabilities that are
 included in corporate reputation. The previous
 paragraph and Figure 1 can justify this issue. In
 testing it empiricaUy we can again use the correlation
 coefficients, high and significant, among the differ
 ent elements of "business reputation" (in the
 example, we find a Pearson correlation coefficient of
 0.794 between "corporate governance and mana
 gerial quality" and "product and service quality",
 and of 0.695 between "innovation" and "efficiency
 in using corporate assets") and the two elements that
 configure the second dimension, "social reputation"
 (with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.782).
 The complex nature of corporate reputation can be
 seen graphicaUy in Figure 1.

 The cornmented issues lead us to state that, from
 an empirical point of view, corporate reputation
 holds a high level of complexity. This makes of it
 one of the more complex firm capabilities. Although
 this characteristic has been extensively highlighted
 by the authors of the Resource-Based View (Amit
 and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1986, 1991; Grant,
 1991; Roberts and Dowling, 2002), our descriptive
 analysis tests this point empiricaUy.

 Conclusions: the business and social
 dimensions of corporate reputation

 This work presents an exploratory analysis of cor
 porate reputation, focused on determining its key
 dimensions empirically. Thus, according to other
 theoretical approaches (stakeholders) and previous
 works (Deephouse, 2000; DeQuevedo, 2001), we
 have found two key components:

 ? Business reputation, that includes the different

 aspects of corporate reputation related to the
 agents and stakeholders that appear closely
 tied to the business activities and processes of
 the firm, as customers, suppliers, managers or
 employees.

 - Social reputation, which is the result of the in

 sights and perceptions of other stakeholders
 that are not so close to day by day business
 activities, as investors and the community in a
 wider sense.

 The obtained results and its discussion confirm
 the two dimensions of reputation obtained by De
 Quevedo (2001) or just defended by Brown and
 Perry (1994).

 Once the two dimensions of corporate reputation
 have been presented, we will discuss the validity and
 reliability tests. Calculating Cronbach's a we can
 check the reliability degree of the scale. The
 obtained results show figures of 0.84 for the first
 factor and of 0.87 for the second one. These results
 are higher than the critical level of 0.70, required for
 accepting the reliability of the scales.

 Both empirical literature review about corporate
 reputation, and in-deep interviews conducted with
 industry experts and managers (the first stage of
 fieldwork) provide content validity for the proposed
 measures.

 From a theoretical perspective, we can affirm the
 degree of tacitness embedded in both dimensions of
 corporate reputation (business reputation and social
 reputation). This fact lies in the own complexity of
 the components that corporate reputation holds (in
 example, corporate governance and managerial
 quality, capability to attract and retain talented
 employees, innovation, or social and green respon
 sibility) and in the interrelations that appear among
 these components (see Figure 1).

 Figure 1. The complexity of corporate reputation.

 Summarizing, this research goes deep into the study
 of corporate reputation, suggesting the coexistence
 of two different dimensions. This point suggests an
 important novelty for understanding corporate rep
 utation as a key element in the legitimization process
 of the firm towards the cornrnunity and society.
