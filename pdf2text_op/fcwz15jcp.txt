Despite the importance of environmental management systems, previous ﬁndings on its relationship
with ﬁnancial performance are inconsistent. This study aims to investigate how the relationship between
environmental management systems and ﬁnancial performance is moderated by switching cost,
competitive intensity and their interaction drawing on contingency theory and an interactional
perspective. We conducted two waves of survey to collect data from 214 Chinese manufacturing ﬁrms
and employed hierarchical moderated regression analysis to test the research hypotheses. The results
reveal that there is a positive relationship between environmental management systems and ﬁnancial
performance. This relationship is negatively moderated by switching cost and is positively moderated by
competitive intensity. In addition, switching cost and competitive intensity have a negative joint
moderating effect on the relationship between environmental management systems and ﬁnancial per-
formance. This study advances environmental management systems research by identifying the market
conditions that augment or constrain the impact of environmental management systems on ﬁnancial
performance.

1. Introduction

Along with the increasing environmental regulations, govern-
ment pressures and green marketing opportunities, research on
environmental management systems (EMSs) has steadily expanded
(Cong and Wei, 2010, 2012; Sroufe, 2003; Lo et al., 2012; von
Malmborg, 2002). An EMS refers to a series of activities relating
to internal policies including collecting, assessing, planning and
implementing, which inﬂuence the organization and its relation-
ships with the natural environment (Feng et al., 2014). However,
the existing empirical research has not yet reached a consensus on
the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance. Some
studies indicated that EMSs enhance ﬁnancial performance due to
improved corporate image, quality green products, and reduced
internal cost through eco-friendly new technologies (e.g., Sroufe,
2003; Darnall et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2012), while others failed

to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship (e.g., Baker and Sinkula, 2005). The
inconsistent previous ﬁndings call for additional research into
contingency factors that may explain under what conditions EMSs
inﬂuence ﬁnancial performance. In other words, it is important to
understand whether the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial
performance depends upon particular contingencies.

In this study, we suggest that market factors need to be taken
into consideration when examining the EMSseﬁnancial perfor-
mance relationship, because the opportunities and constraints of
adopting EMSs are greatly determined by market conditions
(Darnall et al., 2008). Also, the successful transformation of EMSs
into improved ﬁnancial performance depends on a proactive focus
on customer behaviors and market competition (Chan et al., 2012).
To clarify the nature of the EMSseﬁnancial performance rela-
tionship, contingency theory and the interactional perspective are
adopted. According to contingency theory, scholars should pay
more attention to the potential inﬂuence of market conditions
when investigating the performance effects of EMSs (Hatch and
Cunliffe, 2006).
In addition, the interactional perspective in-
dicates that the interaction between dispositions and situations


782

T. Feng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 113 (2016) 781e791

can explain the organizational behavior better than dispositions or
situations separately (Pfeffer, 1997). This perspective suggests that
different situational factors should be considered simultaneously
when explaining how organizational characteristics affect orga-
nizational performance. Drawing upon these two theoretical
perspectives, we propose that market factors may moderate the
relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance. This issue
is crucial but remains mostly overlooked in previous studies on
EMSs.

We focus on two market contingencies, switching cost (SC) and
competitive intensity (CI), which manifest the nature of ﬁrms' re-
lationships with their customers and competitors respectively.
Resource-based view (RBV) suggests that a ﬁrm should leverage its
heterogeneous resources to better meet customer needs and
restrict market competition to achieve a sustained competitive
advantage (Peteraf and Barney, 2003; Sirmon et al., 2007). Thus, a
ﬁrm's competitive advantage and performance gained from EMSs
may be inﬂuenced by the behaviors of its customers and compet-
itors. In addition, according to the strategic analysis perspective,
customers and competitors are the most important market players
that inﬂuence the strategic choices of a ﬁrm (Grant, 2010). Thus,
customers and competitors are likely to affect the performance
effects of the ﬁrm's strategic choices (Zhou and Li, 2010). Based on
these theoretical perspectives, SC and CI may be the most impor-
tant market contingencies inﬂuencing ﬁrms' adoption and imple-
mentation of EMSs, and their abilities to proﬁt
from such
management systems.

Furthermore,

it is likely to be inappropriate to isolate the
moderating effects of SC and CI when investigating the perfor-
mance effects of EMSs, because customer switching and market
competition often coexist for a ﬁrm and may act concurrently
(Seiders et al., 2005). Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously
consider the separate and joint moderating effects of SC and CI.
Moreover, Lumpkin and Dess (2001) suggested that the moderating
effect of environmental hostility on the relationship between
entrepreneurial orientation and performance may be inﬂuenced by
other contingency factors. Similarly, the effect of CI may be inﬂu-
enced by other factors such as SC because ﬁrms have to compete for
customers. Thus, examining the combined moderating roles of SC
and CI may extend our understanding on when EMSs impact
ﬁnancial performance and may offer rich and useful implications to
practitioners. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have
examined how these two essential market factors jointly inﬂuence
the EMSseﬁnancial performance relationship.

To ﬁll these research gaps and gain new insights into the per-
formance effects of EMSs, we address two important questions: (1)
How SC and CI play contingency roles to moderate the relationship
between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance; (2) How SC and CI jointly
moderate the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial perfor-
mance. The purpose of this study is to examine whether and how
the performance effects of EMSs depend on SC, CI, and/or their
combination. Our research contributes to the EMSs literature by
clarifying two types of market conditions (i.e., SC and CI) that in-
ﬂuence the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance.
The ﬁndings of our research highlight that the effect of EMSs on
performance is not necessarily positive but may vary according to
the combined inﬂuence of SC and CI. Thus, this study provides
insightful implications for both theory and practice.

The remainder of this study is organized as follows. In the next
section, we develop research hypotheses. Then, research methods
employed in this study are described and the analysis results are
depicted. Following that, we discuss the implications of the ﬁnd-
ings for theory and practice. Finally, conclusions are drawn, with
further discussion in regards to the limitations of this study and
suggestions for future research.

2. Theoretical background and research hypotheses

By integrating RBV with contingency theory, we propose that
the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance may
depend on certain market conditions, particularly SC and CI. Fig. 1
presents the conceptual model, which highlights the moderating
effects of SC, CI, and their combined effect on the EMSseﬁnancial
performance relationship. Fig. 1 also delineates the research hy-
potheses developed in our research.

2.1. EMSs and ﬁnancial performance

When investigating the performance effect of EMSs, ﬁnancial
performance and social performance are two important aspects of
consideration (Baird et al., 2012). While ﬁnancial performance
concerns more about the proﬁts and material beneﬁts created by a
ﬁrm, social performance focuses on a ﬁrm's relationship with the
society (Baird et al., 2012; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Although
the focuses of these two types of ﬁrm performance are different,
some scholars argued that they are interrelated with each other
(Beurden and Gossling, 2008).

EMSs may represent part of social performance, since it dem-
onstrates a ﬁrm's commitment to social responsibility through
minimizing environmental impacts of its operations (Darnall et al.,
2008). As its objectives and outcomes greatly enhance a ﬁrm's
environmental protection and positive image building towards
stakeholders, existing literature revealed that EMSs are positively
related to social performance (Darnall et al., 2008). To complement
previous research, this study speciﬁcally focuses on the relation-
ship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance, and how this rela-
tionship is moderated by contingency factors in order to provide
further explanation to inconsistent ﬁndings in previous research
(Baker and Sinkula, 2005; Chan et al., 2012; Darnall et al., 2008;
Vachon and Klassen, 2008; Yang et al., 2010).

An EMS involves commitments for pollution prevention, build-
ing environmental policies or planning, implementing activities to
deal with environmental concerns, measuring and assessing po-
tential environmental impacts, establishing quantiﬁable goals to
reduce environmental
impacts, reviewing the implementation
progress, and making adjustment to ensure the achievement of
environmental goals (Coglianese and Nash, 2001; Yang et al., 2010).
Although EMSs adoption is costly, several previous studies sug-
gested that ﬁrms can proﬁt from EMSs implementation (Sroufe,
2003; Darnall et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2012) in several ways.

First, EMSs adoption may help ﬁrms gain government support to
respond to external pressures (Darnall et al., 2008). As not every
ﬁrm has adequate internal resources required for EMSs imple-
mentation, regulators usually provide grants and technical assis-
tance to encourage ﬁrms to adopt EMSs (Dahlstr€om et al., 2003).
The government-sponsored grants and technical assistance are
useful for ﬁrms to mitigate costs associated with EMSs adoption. By
implementing EMSs proactively, ﬁrms can also have access to
regulators more easily and be more qualiﬁed to participate in

government-sponsored EMS programs (Darnall and Edwards,
2006). Moreover, ﬁrms are likely to establish greater external
legitimacy and corporate image through responding to institutional
pressures of protecting the environment (De Bakker et al., 2002;
Sroufe, 2003; Zhang et al., 2008). Because of the enhanced
external legitimacy and corporate image, ﬁrms adopting EMSs can
beneﬁt from charging a premium price and increased customer
loyalty. Such corporate image is an intangible asset which allows
ﬁrms to market their EMSs as selling points for their products, thus
differentiating their products from competitors (Bansal and Hunter,
2003; Darnall et al., 2008).

Second, according to RBV of the ﬁrm, EMSs are strategic re-
sources that can help a ﬁrm gain competitive advantage and ach-
ieve better performance (Menguc and Ozanne, 2005; Russo and
Fouts, 1997). Klassen and Whybark (1999) argued that adopting
EMSs may allow ﬁrms to access unique resources and capabilities.
Firms with sufﬁcient resources and capabilities are more likely to
minimize their environmental impacts. In addition, since EMSs
encourage information sharing and joint problem solving when
addressing environmental issues, a ﬁrm's knowledge-based skills
will be developed and enhanced (Darnall et al., 2008). By devel-
oping knowledge-based capitals, ﬁrms can achieve greater success
at reducing environmental protection costs (Christmann, 2000),
gaining an advantage over competitors and winning customers (Lo
et al., 2012; Vachon and Klassen, 2008).

Finally, EMSs may help ﬁrms gain competitive advantage
through providing cost savings opportunities (Yang et al., 2010;
Sroufe, 2003). EMSs encourage ﬁrms to establish environmental
planning throughout the full range of the ﬁrm's activities, from raw
materials acquisition, through manufacture, to product distribution
to minimize the lifecycle costs of their products and develop new
products with lower life-cycle costs (Melnyk et al., 2003). Menguc
and Ozanne (2005) found that ﬁrms attempting to reduce phys-
ical waste or dispose of physical waste through environmental-
friendly ways, may reduce costs and improve proﬁtability.
Recently, Wong et al. (2012) suggested that the use of reusable
components and parts extracted from returned products offers cost
saving opportunities for ﬁrms. Hence, we propose the following
hypothesis:

H1. There is a positive relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial
performance.

2.2. The moderating effect of SC

SC represents an obstacle for customers to change their product
providers (Wathne et al., 2001), and it is a crucial factor that de-
termines the competitiveness of a market environment (Jones et al.,
2002). SC is deﬁned as the costs that consumers have to pay during
the process of switching from one product provider to another
(Anton et al., 2007; Yee et al., 2010). When customers switch
product providers they need to bear various costs ranging from
time spent searching for and evaluating potential alternatives,
learning how to operate new product, and building relationship
with the new provider to the beneﬁts lost by changing provider
(Jones et al., 2002; Yee et al., 2010).

SC moderates the effects of EMSs on ﬁrms' ﬁnancial perfor-
mance due to the following logics. If a customer perceives SC as low,
dissatisfaction with the ﬁrm will motivate his/her intention to
switch product provider. Thus, ﬁrms adopting EMSs may attract
more customers and improve the repeat purchase rate based on
their superior public image and green products. However, if a
customer perceives SC as high, he/she may become less sensitive to
its provider's behaviors (Yee et al., 2010). This will potentially
prohibit socially responsible ﬁrms to intentionally make more

proﬁt due to the relatively ﬁxed supplierecustomer relationships
(Friedl and Wagner, 2012). Since high SC discourages changing the
current provider, thereby yielding less proﬁt incentive for ﬁrms to
actively adopt EMSs. Therefore, when SC is low rather than high,
EMSs may lead to greater performance. Therefore, we hypothesize:

H2. SC negatively moderates the relationship between EMSs and
ﬁnancial performance.

2.3. The moderating effect of CI

CI is another important factor determining the competitiveness
of market environment, which reﬂects the level of competition
among ﬁrms (Auh and Menguc, 2005; Tsai and Yang, 2013).
Enhanced CI features greater competition among incumbents, and
fewer opportunities for further growth (Auh and Menguc, 2005; Li
et al., 2008). When CI is low, ﬁrms can operate with their existing
systems to take full advantage of the transparent predictability of
their own behavior (Auh and Menguc, 2005). However, more
intense competition will force ﬁrms to adapt their operational
strategies accordingly. When the competition is intense, ﬁrms will
need to undertake proactive activities, such as looking for new
ways to compete and exploring differentiation based on eco-
friendly procedures and products to escape from price or promo-
tion wars.

We posit that CI may also moderate the relationship between
EMSs and ﬁnancial performance for three major reasons. First,
differentiation is likely to mitigate the potential threat of compe-
tition (Tsai and Yang, 2013). Firms adopting EMSs are likely to build
differentiation advantages (Bansal and Hunter, 2003; Darnall et al.,
2008). EMSs adoption may also increase customer loyalty through
improved ﬁrm image and product quality. Thus, ﬁrms imple-
menting EMSs are more capable of winning price or promotion
wars. Second, information processing theory suggests that ﬁrms
adopting EMSs are in a favorable position since they can rapidly
acquire and interpret a wide range of competitor information and
utilize the information to develop creative responses to environ-
mental issues (Tsai and Yang, 2013). As competition intensiﬁes, the
need to gather and analyze competitor information will be heated.
Hence, increased competition in markets may place a premium on
EMSs. Third, with the rising of global environmental concerns,
customers are increasingly demanding for eco-friendly products
from their suppliers (Banerjee et al., 2003). Thus, if a ﬁrm can
implement EMSs to come up with new solutions to reduce the
negative environmental impacts of its operations and/or products,
the performance effects of EMSs will be even more salient under a
condition of high rather than low level of CI (Chan et al., 2012).
Based on these arguments, it is predicted:

H3. CI positively moderates the relationship between EMSs and
ﬁnancial performance.

2.4. The joint moderating effects of SC and CI

In addition to their independent moderating effects, SC and CI
may jointly moderate the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial
performance. Since customer switching and market competition
often coexist in the market and may act together (Seiders et al.,
2005), these two factors are likely to have a synergistic moder-
ating effect on the degree to which EMSs contribute to ﬁnancial
performance. Moreover, environmental dynamism and hostility
may interactively inﬂuence the effectiveness of organizational
strategic decisions (Luo and Park, 2001). Lee et al. (2001) also
suggested that SC becomes more important when there are a great


784

T. Feng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 113 (2016) 781e791

number of alternative providers in a market. We thus conjecture
that SC and CI may interactively affect the impact of EMSs on
ﬁnancial performance. In other words, the moderating effect of
each of these two factors is likely to be dependent on the other.

Furthermore, separating the impacts of each contingent factor
may underestimate the complex forms of interaction and may thus
oversimplify the actual situations under which EMSs inﬂuence
ﬁnancial performance (Tsai and Yang, 2013). In contrast, when
considered simultaneously, SC and CI may “yield a more inter-
pretable and theoretically interesting pattern than any of the fac-
tors would show in isolation” (Rousseau and Fried, 2001, p. 4). From
an interactional perspective, we examine how the interaction of SC
and CI affects the performance effects of EMSs. An interactional
perspective here suggests that the combination of SC and CI will
form a set of market conditions according to the levels of the two
variables and that these different market conditions may have
different inﬂuences on the performance effects of EMSs. Since the
four kinds of different market conditions (i.e., low and high levels of
SC and CI) may generate different opportunities, constraints and
challenges in a market, the strength of the relationship between
EMSs and ﬁnancial performance may vary across these market
conditions. At one extreme, under the condition of low SC and high
CI, ﬁrms should gain the most beneﬁt by implementing EMSs. If
customers can switch to a new provider with a low cost and
competitors can begin price or promotion wars rapidly, ﬁrms are
most likely to realize the maximum value of their EMSs adoption
because they can better take advantage of customer switching and
can provide products that are more differentiated than their
competitors.

At the opposite extreme, under the condition of high SC and low
CI, the effect of EMSs on ﬁnancial performance diminishes. When
customer switching is costly and competition is not intense, ﬁrms
implementing EMSs may improve performance but only to a lesser
degree. Therefore, it may be less cost effective for a ﬁrm to adopt
EMSs under such conditions. Situated between these two extremes,
the remaining two conditions (i.e., low SC with low CI and high SC

with high CI) may have an intermediate effect on the strength of the
relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance. However,
few studies have investigated which of these two factors has a
stronger effect on the effectiveness of organizational decisions. In
this study, we suggest that SC may have a greater inﬂuence on the
performance effects of EMSs because attracting and retaining cus-
tomers require innovative activities such as EMSs within the ﬁrm,
whereas CI may not always justify EMSs as ﬁrms can achieve
competitive advantages through other approaches (Benner and
Tushman, 2003; Tsai and Yang, 2013). This speculation is also
supported by Henard and Szymanski's (2001) ﬁnding that meeting
customer needs has a greater impact on new product performance
than competition does. Therefore, we conjecture that EMSs may
improve ﬁnancial performance to a larger degree under the con-
dition of low SC and low CI than under the condition of high SC and
high CI. These arguments lead to the following hypothesis:

H4. SC and CI have a negative joint moderating effect on the
relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance.

3. Methods

3.1. Data collection

Because of China's size and economic diversity, we strategically
chose ﬁve provinces or municipalities that represent different
economic levels and are geographically diverse: Shaanxi, Shan-
dong, Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong. Shaanxi, a traditional in-
dustrial province in northwestern inland China, represents a
relatively early stage of economic reform and market formation.
Shandong and Jiangsu are located in the Bohai Sea Coastal Region
and in the Yangtze River Delta respectively, and both enjoy a rela-
tively high degree of economic development. Beijing and Guang-
dong are located in the Bohai Sea Coastal Region and in the afﬂuent
Pearl River Delta respectively, reﬂect the average level of economic
development. These ﬁve provinces are representative of the various

785

regions of China. The locations of sampled provinces or munici-
palities are shown in Fig. 2.

To obtain a representative sample of ﬁrms, we randomly
selected ﬁrms from the China Business Yellow Pages. In each
province, we randomly chose 150 ﬁrms, and in total, 750 ﬁrms were
sampled. The selected ﬁrms represent a wide range of industries,
including communication and computers related equipment, ma-
chinery, transport equipment, electrical machinery and equipment,
and rubber and plastics, among others. An initial telephone enquiry
was conducted before the formal survey, and 246 ﬁrms agreed to
participate in the survey. In each selected ﬁrm two key informants
were identiﬁed to ﬁll out the questionnaire. The key informants
typically held positions such as CEO/president, vice president, or
director in charge of marketing and purchasing, and were knowl-
edgeable about the ﬁrm's internal and external processes. Existing
environmental literature has used subjective perceptions of re-
spondents to operationalize performance (e.g. Chan et al., 2012;
Lopez-Gamero et al., 2010; Youn et al., 2013). The main reason is
that respondents were more open to offering their perceptions
rather than offering precise quantitative data (Aragon-Correa et al.,
2008; Lopez-Gamero et al., 2010).

In this study, we conducted two waves of survey. At T1, in-
formants reported EMSs, SC, CI, market turbulence and ﬁrm inno-
vativeness. The questionnaire together with a covering letter
explaining our research objectives and ensuring conﬁdentiality was
then mailed to one respondent identiﬁed in the ﬁrm. We also
indicated that if the informant felt that it was difﬁcult for him/her
to answer certain questions, he/she could recommend a more
appropriate person to answer those questions. Three follow-up
calls and mailings were made at 2, 4, and 8 weeks to improve the
response rate. During the survey, about 200 follow-up calls were
made and 100 follow-up letters were sent. At T2, about 1.5 years
after T1, we asked another informant in each ﬁrm to respond to the
scales of ﬁnancial performance.

Finally, we received 214 valid questionnaires. Among them, 53
were from Shandong (24.8%), 50 were from Shaanxi (23.3%), 39
were from Beijing (18.2%), 38 were from Guangdong (17.8%), and 34
were Jiangsu (15.9%). These ﬁrms covered a wide range of owner-
ship types,
including state-owned and controlled enterprises
(27.3%), privately owned and controlled enterprises (35.8%), and
joint ventures (36.9%). The response rate was 28.5%. The response
rate for this study is comparable to or better than other survey-
based studies in environmental strategy management (e.g., 24.7%
in Darnall et al., 2008; 21.4% in Yang et al., 2010).

To test for non-response bias, the sample was split into two
groups based on the time they returned the questionnaire
(Armstrong and Overton, 1977). We compared number of em-
ployees, annual sales and all variables used in this study between
early and late responses. No signiﬁcant differences were found
between them at the signiﬁcance level of 0.05, suggesting that non-
response bias was not an issue.

3.2. Measures

We measured the variables through adopting or adapting
existing scales that have been validated in previous studies. Since
the scales used in this study were adopted or adapted from English
literature, we used the translation and back-translation approach to
develop the Chinese version of those measures. Before the formal
survey, eight managers that are familiar with the operational
practices in China and three experiential researchers that are well
versed in both English and Chinese reviewed the questionnaire to
improve clarity and resolve any unfamiliar or unclear wording. We
pre-tested the initial version of
the questionnaire with ten
randomly selected ﬁrms in Xi'an. Managers from top- or middle-

level positions within their organizations evaluated the clarity
and understandability of the scales. Based on the managers' feed-
back, we further reﬁned the survey questions and completed the
ﬁnal version of the questionnaire.

All of the measures were seven-point Likert scales. The in-
formants were requested to indicate the extent to which they
agreed with the scale items by providing scores from “1 ¼ strongly
disagree” to “7 ¼ strongly agree” or by evaluating the performance
measures on a scale ranging from “1 ¼ very low” to “7 ¼ very high”.
The value of each construct is the average of individual item's rat-
ing. The measurement items used in this study are presented in
Appendix A.

This study measured EMSs as the extent to which an organiza-
tion implements environmental practices. The scale for EMSs
consisted of seven items that were adopted from Yang et al. (2010).
We measured SC as the costs that a customer has to pay during the
process of switching from one ﬁrm to another. Corresponding to
Yee et al. (2010), we applied four items to measure SC. CI refers to
the degree of competition in an industry. It was measured using six
items adapted from Auh and Menguc (2005). We measured ﬁnan-
cial performance as a ﬁrm's ﬁnancial and market performance
relative to those of
its major competitors. The seven items
measuring ﬁnancial performance were taken from Li et al. (2009)
and Flynn et al. (2010).

When testing the hypothesized relationships, we controlled for
factors that might confound the effects. This study
several
measured ﬁrm size by the logarithm of the number of employees.
Firm age was measured as the logarithm of the number of years
since the ﬁrm's establishment. This study measured market tur-
bulence as the rate of change in customer demands. Our scale for
market turbulence consisted of four items that were adapted from
Germain et al. (2008). The scale for ﬁrm innovativeness was
adapted from Panayides and VenusLun (2009) and was assessed by
ﬁve items.

3.3. Construct reliability and validity

We ﬁrstly conducted a conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) by
linking each item to its intended construct using the maximum
likelihood estimation method in LISREL 8.80. The ﬁt indices for the
CFA model indicated a good ﬁt of the model to the data based on the
recommended criteria: c2/df < 3 (Hekman et al., 2009), NNFI > 0.90,
CFI > 0.90, RMSEA < 0.08 and SRMR < 0.08 (Hair et al., 2010). We
then assessed the degree of internal consistency among the items
of each construct with Cronbach's alpha reliability coefﬁcient in
SPSS 21.0. The Cronbach's alpha values for the constructs ranged
from 0.891 to 0.972 (see Table 1), all of which exceeded the rec-
ommended 0.70 threshold (Hair et al., 2010). For evaluating reli-
ability, we calculated composite reliability (CR) and Corrected Item-
Total Correlation (CITC). The recommended criterion for them is
0.60 and 0.30 respectively (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Kerlinger,
1986). The results in Table 1 provide evidence that all constructs
have sufﬁcient reliability.

Furthermore, we assessed the content validity, convergent val-
idity and discriminant validity. The content validity of the con-
structs was ensured by the extensive literature review, feedback
from executives and academicians and the pilot test. The conver-
gent and discriminant validity of the scales were examined using
the method recommended by Fornell and Larcker (1981).

The factor loading of each scale item was statistically signiﬁcant
(p < 0.001) and above 0.60, which indicated adequate convergent
validity of each construct (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). We also
assessed convergent validity of each construct using average vari-
ance extracted (AVE). The AVE values for the constructs ranged
from 0.684 to 0.894, all of which were greater than the 0.50

threshold (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). These results suggested that each
construct exhibited good convergent validity.

According to Fornell and Larcker (1981), if the AVE values for any
two constructs are greater than the corresponding squared corre-
lation estimate, the discriminant validity between the two con-
structs is veriﬁed. The results in Table 2 demonstrated that the
square roots of the AVE values for each pair of the constructs were
greater than the corresponding correlation estimate, indicating
discriminant validity between the constructs. Moreover, we also
assessed the discriminant validity of the constructs with chi-square
difference tests and conﬁdence intervals for the inter-construct
correlation estimates (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). The results
of the ﬁfteen chi-square difference tests in the CFA models indi-
cated that for each of the ﬁfteen pairs of constructs, the chi-square
value obtained for the constrained model was signiﬁcantly greater
than the chi-square value obtained for the unconstrained model,
which ensures the discriminant validity between any two of the
constructs. In addition, we calculated the conﬁdence interval (±two
standard errors) around the correlation estimate between any two
constructs. The results showed that none of the ﬁfteen conﬁdence
intervals included 1.0, further demonstrating discriminant validity.

3.4. Common method variance

This study used several procedures suggested by Podsakoff et al.
(2003) to reduce and evaluate the possibility of common method
variance (CMV). First, the independent/moderating and dependent
variables were based on data collecting at different points of time
and from different informants. Thus, the inﬂuence of CMV can be
reduced. Second, the order of the questions was mixed by putting
the items of each construct on different pages with items of the
other constructs to reduce the contextual inﬂuences. Third, we
conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine
whether a single factor explained the majority of the variance
among the constructs. The results showed that six factors were
necessary to account for the variances in these constructs and that
the ﬁrst factor explained less than 50% of the variance (37.0% of
87.4%). Thus, CMV was not a signiﬁcant concern in this study.
Fourth, we carried out CFA for Harman's single-factor analysis.
Harman's
yielded
c2(299) ¼ 6359.49 (compared with c2(284) ¼ 721.42 for the CFA
model). The ﬁt indicated that several distinct factors exist in our
research, which further suggested that CMV is not a serious

problem. Finally, we reexamined the measurement model by add-
ing a method factor in addition to the traits (Cote and Buckley,
1987). The results of the method factor model indicated that the
model ﬁt indices were only marginally improved (NNFI by 0.01 and
CFI by 0.01), with the common method factor accounting for 2.74%
of the total variance. In addition, the factor loadings were still
signiﬁcant in spite of the inclusion of a method factor, indicating
that the model was robust (Flynn et al., 2010).

4. Analysis and results

In this study, hierarchical moderated regression analysis was
employed to test the hypotheses. We entered the control variables
into the regression equation in model 1, all three predictors in
model 2, three two-way interactions in model 3, and the three-way
interaction in model 4. The results of the regression analysis are
shown in Table 3. As presented in Table 3, the relationship between
EMSs and ﬁnancial performance is positive and signiﬁcant
(b ¼ 0.228, p < 0.05). Thus, H1 is supported. This is consistent with
the ﬁndings in previous studies (e.g., Sroufe, 2003; Darnall et al.,
2008; Chan et al., 2012). Following previous studies (e.g., Hekman
et al., 2009; Shalley et al., 2009), we ﬁrst assessed the results of
H4. As illustrated in Table 3, the increase in R2 from model 3 to
model 4 is 0.009, and it is signiﬁcant (p < 0.10), which indicates that
the addition of the three-way interaction among EMSs, SC, and CI
signiﬁcantly increased 0.9% of the explanation of variance in
ﬁnancial performance. In addition, model 4 in Table 3 reveals that
the coefﬁcient for the three-way interaction effect is negative and
signiﬁcant (b ¼  0.159, p < 0.10). These ﬁndings provide support for
H4.

To further check the nature of the three-way interaction, we
calculated the slopes of the simple regression equations of ﬁnancial
performance on EMSs for each of the four types of market condi-
tions of low and high levels of SC and CI (i.e., one standard deviation
below and above their respective means) and examined whether
each simple slope was signiﬁcantly different from zero (Aiken and
West, 1991). Because the sample size in our study is not particularly
large, we follow the suggestions of previous studies (Bing et al.,
2007; Sauley and Bedeian, 1989) in using 0.10 as the signiﬁcance
level to increase the chances of detecting the effects of interactions.

The results of the slope tests showed that the effect of EMSs on
performance was the most positive and signiﬁcant under low SC
and high CI (simple slope ¼ 0.828, p < 0.001); the second most
positive and signiﬁcant effect occurred under low SC and low CI
(simple slope ¼ 0.147, p < 0.10); the least positive effect occurred
under high SC and high CI (simple slope ¼ 0.035, p > 0.10); and the
effect was negative but insigniﬁcant happened under high SC and
low CI (simple slope ¼  0.108, p > 0.10). In this study, we also
graphed the four preceding simple regression lines following
Dawson and Richter's (2006) approach. As depicted in Fig. 3, the
different slopes of these simple regression lines indicate that the
effects of EMSs on ﬁnancial performance are different across the
different kinds of market conditions of SC and CI.

Furthermore, Fig. 3 illustrates that the positive slope of ﬁnancial
performance that regressed on EMSs under low SC and high CI is far
greater than the positive slope under high SC and high CI. To test
whether the difference between this pair of simple slopes is
signiﬁcantly different from zero, we conducted a supplementary
analysis of slope difference following Dawson and Richter's (2006)
method. The results indicate that the simple slope under low SC
and high CI is signiﬁcantly greater than the simple slope under high

SC and high CI (Db ¼ 0.793, p < 0.001). This ﬁnding shows that
EMSs generate much higher performance when SC is low and CI is
high than when both SC and CI are high.

Finally, we examined H2 and H3. However, we did not interpret
the two-way interactions because their effects on ﬁnancial per-
formance depend on a variable that is not included in the interac-
tion if the effect of three-way interaction is signiﬁcant (Aiken and
West, 1991). In Table 3, we found that the increase in R2 from
model 2 to model 3 is signiﬁcant (DR2 ¼ 0.072, p < 0.001). Model 3
reveals that the coefﬁcient for the two-way interaction between
EMSs and SC is negative and signiﬁcant (b ¼  0.285, p < 0.001).
Thus, H2 is supported. Moreover, model 3 indicates that the coef-
ﬁcient for the two-way interaction between EMSs and CI is positive
and signiﬁcant (b ¼ 0.160, p < 0.05). This result provides support for
H3.

5. Discussion and managerial implications

5.1. Discussion

risks of

implementing EMSs,

In this study, we aim to advance the environmental strategy
literature by simultaneously examining the individual and joint
moderating effects of SC and CI on the relationship between EMSs
and ﬁnancial performance. The results reveal that both SC and CI
have independent moderating effects on the EMSseﬁnancial per-
formance relationship. This ﬁnding is consistent with the argument
of Zhu and Sarkis (2007) that ﬁrms should implement environ-
mental practices to achieve improved performance in highly
competitive markets. This study also indicates that, as expected,
when SC is low and CI is high, EMSs have the most positive impact
on ﬁnancial performance. Interestingly, the performance effect of
EMSs becomes negative when SC is high and CI is low. This high-
lights the potential
including
increased costs in human resources and management, especially
when costs for a customer switching to another product or service
provider is high and market competition is low. These ﬁndings
show distinct impacts of EMSs on ﬁnancial performance under the
simultaneous inﬂuence of SC and CI. Further inspection of four
simple regression lines (see Fig. 3) illustrates how the direction and
magnitude of the EMSseﬁnancial performance relationship are
affected by SC and CI concurrently. In speciﬁc, when SC is high, the
performance effect of EMSs goes from negative to positive as the
level of CI increases. The ﬁnding that the positive relationship be-
tween EMSs and ﬁnancial performance is not signiﬁcant in the
context of high SC and high CI is surprising but plausible because
loyal customers coupled with frequent price or promotion wars are
likely to neutralize the potential beneﬁts of EMSs. Moreover, when
SC is high and CI is low, EMSs could be detrimental to performance
because the proﬁts from EMSs cannot be sufﬁcient to remedy the
costs of adopting EMSs. It appears that ﬁerce market competition
strengthens the necessity of EMSs adoption under less customer
switching conditions. In other words, the ability of proﬁting from
EMSs for ﬁrms that operate in markets with high customer SC may
depend greatly on whether the competition is intense or not.

Similarly, when SC is low, the positive performance effect of
EMSs increases with the level of CI. These ﬁndings reveal that CI
may have consistently positive moderating effect on the relation-
ship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance regardless of the
level of SC. However, CI alone may be insufﬁcient because excessive
competition may render the adoption of EMSs unproﬁtable for
ﬁrms when the level of SC is high. Although implementing EMSs
may be beneﬁcial due to a differentiation advantage, “intense
competition produces pressure on ﬁrms to improve efﬁciency and
lower prices, which may lead to tighter margins” (Tsai and Yang,
2013, pp. 1288). Thus, adopting EMSs may not enhance

performance under conditions of high CI and high SC. However, if
SC is low such competition will be coupled with frequent customer
switching behaviors. Under this condition, implementing EMSs
appears to be relatively beneﬁcial for ﬁrms because the value of
differentiation increases.

Furthermore, when CI is low, the performance effect of EMSs
decreases with the level of SC. This ﬁnding indicates that ﬁrms with
idiosyncratic resources, such as EMSs, will not be able to continue
to exploit these resources to gain a competitive advantage if their
markets remain relatively high on customer switching and low on
competition. Similarly, when CI is high, the performance effect of
EMSs decreases considerably with the level of SC, and the effect is
the most positive at a low level of SC while it is the least positive at a
high level of SC. These ﬁndings are remarkable because the previ-
ous EMSs research on the moderating effects of SC and CI are quite
limited and has not investigated how the individual moderating
effect of either SC or CI is dependent on each other. Overall, it ap-
pears that SC and CI jointly interact with EMSs to inﬂuence the level
of ﬁnancial performance.

5.2. Theory contributions

Our research contributes to EMSs research in several ways. First,
this study highlights the important roles of SC and CI in jointly
inﬂuencing the economic value of EMSs. Our ﬁndings reveal that SC
and CI synergistically moderate the positive effect of EMSs on
performance. The performance effect of EMSs becomes increasingly
positive as SC decreases and CI increases concurrently. The highest
level of ﬁnancial performance is generated when EMSs and CI are
high and SC is low. That is, EMSs play an important role in helping
ﬁrms to be prosperous within a market characterized by low SC and
high CI. These ﬁndings provide support to the contingent RBV,
which demonstrates that the value of a ﬁrm's unique resources may
depend upon relevant environmental conditions (Aragon-Correa
and Sharma, 2003). In addition, our ﬁndings also serve as sup-
porting evidence for the dynamic capabilities perspective, which
suggests that a ﬁrm should align its resources and capabilities with
the requirements of
to achieve
competitive advantage (Teece, 2007). EMSs can help ﬁrms recon-
ﬁgure their unique resources, and thus, the importance of EMSs is
ampliﬁed in a market of low SC and intense competition.

the business environment

Second, our ﬁndings further indicate that the performance ef-
fect of EMSs is contingent on the levels of SC and CI. Contrary to
traditional wisdom, higher level of EMSs is not always better.
Although EMSs contribute substantially to performance under
conditions of low SC and high CI, ﬁrms cannot proﬁt from EMSs
under conditions of high SC and low CI. In essence, SC and CI jointly
form the boundary conditions and limit the value of EMSs. From the
perspective of strategic ﬁt (Grant, 2010; Zajac et al., 2000), the level
of EMSs should ﬁt with the speciﬁc market conditions that are
formed by SC and CI to enhance performance.

Third, this study suggests that EMSs are more effective when
adapting to SC than when coping with CI. The performance effect of
EMSs is positive and signiﬁcant when both SC and CI are low, while
it is insigniﬁcant when both SC and CI are high. That is, low SC
justiﬁes the implementation of EMSs rather than intense compe-
tition. Moreover,
the performance effect of EMSs is further
augmented by the combination of SC and CI. In other words, the
contribution of EMSs under either SC or CI depends on the level of
the other. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that the increase in the value
of EMSs that occurs due to SC (CI) will be limited unless strong
competition (low SC) is also present.

Finally, the results of our research reveal that the coexistence of
SC and CI generates different forms of interactions that inﬂuence
the effect of EMSs on ﬁnancial performance differently. These

789

ﬁndings could serve as supporting evidence that SC and CI work
together to inﬂuence the effectiveness of organizational decisions.
Thus, this study shows that distinguishing environmental factors
and examining their joint effects using an interactional perspective
may be particularly useful for offering important theoretical and
managerial insights.

5.3. Managerial implications

Our ﬁndings provide practical guidelines for managers. First,
this study suggests that EMSs is critical for ﬁrms that pursue to
enhance ﬁnancial performance in markets with low SC and intense
competition. To ensure success under such complex market con-
ditions, ﬁrms should cultivate a culture for proactive management
of their operations, processes and products to minimize negative
environmental impacts. Managers should encourage employees to
commit to continuous environmental improvement programs to
exploit opportunities and neutralizing threats confronting their
ﬁrms. In addition, managers should be closely involved in the
process of EMSs implementation, and support EMSs initiatives.

Second, managers should pay attention to customer switching
behaviors and competitor actions when evaluating the values of
EMSs. Disregarding either customer intelligence or competitor in-
telligence will weaken a ﬁrm's ability to proﬁt from EMSs. Since
implementing EMSs may be costly and risky, managers should align
their ﬁrms' EMSs efforts with the requirements of environmental
conditions. If ﬁrms adopting EMSs do not correctly predict and
interpret varying trends with respect to both customer behaviors
and competitor actions, they are likely to implement EMSs in the
wrong time and/or at improper levels.

Third, managers should also be informed that the value of
EMSs differs across different kinds of market conditions and may
fail to achieve success under high SC and low CI. To effectively
allocate and utilize resources, a ﬁrm should match the level of
EMSs with its particular market conditions. In a market with low
SC and high CI, a ﬁrm needs to be proactive to adopt EMSs if it
wants to transform market threats into favorable opportunities.
However, in a market with less customer switching behavior and
high competition, a ﬁrm does not need to be very active in
implementing EMSs because the effect of EMSs on performance is
rather weak. Under such a scenario, ﬁrms should slow or cut some
of their investments in activities related to EMSs. Furthermore,
managers should be aware that EMSs has no inﬂuence on ﬁnancial
performance in a market with high SC and low competition. In this
situation,
the differentiation advantage of EMSs disappears
because of the relative high loyalty of customers. In sum, man-
agers should adapt their ﬁrms' degree of EMSs implementation to
ﬁt with changing market conditions and to take advantage of the
opportunities created by these conditions in order to achieve
superior performance.

6. Conclusions, limitations and future directions

6.1. Conclusions

Findings in this study reveal that there is a positive relation-
ship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance. This relationship
is negatively moderated by SC and is positively moderated by CI.
In addition, SC and CI have a negative joint moderating effect on
the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance. Thus,
this study underpins the important role of market conditions
in inﬂuencing the performance effect of EMSs. Market conditions
such as SC and CI also inﬂuence the relationship between
EMSs and ﬁnancial performance jointly. Overall, this study sig-
nals the important role of market conditions and calls for

further attention to market conditions as potential moderators
when investigating the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial
performance.

6.2. Limitations and future directions

This research has some limitations that provide opportunities
for future research. First, this study used self-reported subjective
data in each ﬁrm. This approach may generate CMV issues and
inﬂated the relationship between EMSs and ﬁnancial performance.
This limitation should be taken into account when interpreting our
ﬁndings. However, self-reported data are not inherently ﬂawed and
CMV concerns may be overstated, especially given the complex
nature of the interaction effects in our study. Despite the results of
statistical remedies which suggest that CMV issues are not sufﬁ-
ciently serious, future research could use multiple data sources to
enhance the reliability of our ﬁndings. For example, future studies
may combine subjective and objective measures of ﬁnancial
performance.

Second, our study examines the joint moderating effects of SC
and CI. However, other factors, such as environmental uncertainty
and learning orientation may also affect the relationship between
EMSs and ﬁnancial performance. Future research therefore could
examine whether and how interactions of other environmental and
organizational factors inﬂuence the impact of EMSs on ﬁnancial
performance. A conﬁgurational approach should also be followed
to gain more insightful ﬁndings. Additionally, future researchers
could investigate whether the moderating effects of SC and CI
depend on any additional factors, such as the stage of a ﬁrm's in-
dustry lifecycle to enrich the research implications.

Third, we only focused on ﬁnancial performance in this study. In
addition to ﬁnancial performance, investigating the impact of EMSs
on other forms of ﬁrm performance (e.g., operational performance
and social performance) may provide more insightful ﬁndings.
Future studies could consider the inﬂuence of EMSs on other forms
of ﬁrm performance to enrich and extend the literature on envi-
ronment management.

Finally, the underlying mechanisms through which EMSs in-
ﬂuence ﬁnancial performance (i.e., the possible mediator) are still
not well addressed. To the best of our knowledge, little research has
empirically investigated this important issue. Future research may
provide useful insights into management practices by exploring
why and how other factors, such as customer satisfaction may serve
as the pathways that mediate the link between EMSs and ﬁnancial
performance.
