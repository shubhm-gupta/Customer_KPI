EFFECTS OF HUMAN  RESOURCE SYSTEMS  ON 

MANUFACTURING  PERFORMANCE AND TURNOVER 

JEFFREY B. ARTHUR 

Purdue  University 

Using  an  empirical  taxonomy  identifying  two  types  of human  resource 
systems,  "control"  and  "commitment,"  this  study  tested  the  strategic 
human  resource  proposition  that  specific  combinations  of policies  and 
practices  are  useful  in  predicting  differences  in  performance  and  turn- 
over  across  steel  "minimills."  The  mills  with  commitment  systems  had 
lower  scrap  rates,  and  lower  employee  turnover 
higher  productivity, 
than  those  with  control  systems.  In  addition,  human  resource  system 
moderated  the  relationship  between  turnover  and  manufacturing  per- 
formance. 

Long  a  concern  among  organizational  contingency  theory  researchers, 
the  concept  of the  congruence,  or fit,  between  diverse  sets  of organizational 
policies  and  practices  has  recently  emerged  as an important  subject  of study 
for  human  resources  management  researchers.  This  new  strategic,  macro, 
human  resource  management  perspective  differs  markedly  from  the  more 
traditional  approach  focusing  on  the  effects  of  separate  human  resource 
practices  on  individual-level  outcomes  (Butler, Ferris,  & Napier,  1991; Jack- 
son,  Schuler,  & Rivero,  1989;  Mahoney  & Deckup,  1986;  Snell,  1992).  In 
contrast,  the  strategic  human  resource  management  perspective 
integrates 
macro-level  theories  and  concepts  to  explore  the  impact  of  specific  config- 
urations,  or systems,  of human  resource  activities  on  organization-level  per- 
formance  outcomes  (Dyer & Holder,  1988; Fisher,  1989; Wright & McMahan, 
1992). 

Dobbins,  Cardy, and Carson pointed  out that although  a macro approach 
to studying  human  resource  issues  appears  promising  and conceptually  very 
is  ultimately  an  empirical  question" 
rich,  "the  validity  of  its  propositions 
(1991:  33).  Empirical  evidence  demonstrating  the  predictive  value  of  the 
strategic  human  resource  perspective,  however,  has  not  been  forthcoming. 
Conceptual  typologies  abound  in  this  literature,  but  empirically  based  tax- 
onomies  of human  resource  strategies  are rare. As  a result,  basic  hypotheses 
concerning  the  implications  for firm  performance  that  flow  from the  strate- 
gic  human  resource  perspective  have  generally  not  been  tested.  A  recent

review  of  strategic  human  resource  management,  for  example,  concluded 
that  "there  is  little  empirical  evidence  to  suggest  that  strategic  HR directly 
influences  organizational  performance  or  competitive  advantage"  (Leng- 
nick-Hall  & Lengnick-Hall,  1988:  468). 

In this  study,  I addressed  this  important  gap in the  existing  literature by 
empirically  testing  specific  organizational  performance  hypotheses  flowing 
from  a  strategic  human  resource  management  perspective.  To  accomplish 
this,  I drew  on  the  results  of  a previous  study  that  used  a  cluster  analysis 
technique  to  empirically 
identify  two  types  of  human  resource  systems, 
labeled  "control"  and  "commitment"  systems,  in a sample  of steel  minimills 
(Arthur,  1992).1  I developed  and  tested  propositions  regarding the  utility  of 
this  human  resource  system  taxonomy  for  predicting  both  manufacturing 
performance,  measured  as  labor  efficiency  and  scrap  rate,  and  the  level  of 
employee  turnover  in  steel  minimills.  In addition,  I tested  the  proposition 
that the  relationship  between  turnover  and  manufacturing  performance  dif- 
fers  significantly  across  the  two  systems. 

THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT AND  HYPOTHESES 

Testing  the  strategic  human  resource  perspective  first  requires  catego- 
rizing  organizations  into  a meaningful  typology  of human  resource  systems. 
Using  the  strategic  perspective,  a number  of  authors  have  suggested  typol- 
ogies  (e.g.,  Dyer  & Holder,  1988;  Miles  & Snow,  1984;  Osterman,  1987; 
Schuler  & Jackson,  1987;  Walton,  1985).  Underlying  the  use  of these  typol- 
ogies  is the  proposition  that organizations  differ in their basic  approaches  or 
objectives  in managing  human  assets.  These  objectives,  often  stated  in terms 
of desired  employee  characteristics,  attitudes,  and behaviors,  are (or should 
be)  derived  from  a firm's  overall  business  goals  and  may  be  moderated  by 
factors  internal  and  external  to  the  organization  (Schuler,  1992;  Wright  & 
McMahan,  1992).  However,  because  these  typologies  have  not  been  consis- 
tently  measured,  their validity  and predictive  power  have  not been  assessed. 
Control  and  Commitment  Human  Resource  Systems 

My earlier  research  (Arthur, 1992)  is  one  of the  first published  attempts 
to  develop  an  empirical  classification  of  firms  based  on  human  resource 
system  characteristics.  Applying  a  cluster  analysis  technique  to  data  from 
human  resource  managers,  I found  that  the  variety  of  human  resource  pol- 
icies  and  practices  in  30  U.S.  steel  minimills  could  be  meaningfully  de- 
scribed  by six  clusters,  or systems.  Further, I grouped  those  systems  into  two 
broad categories  based  on their  characteristics  and the functions  they  served 
and  labeled  them  "cost  reducers"  and  "commitment  maximizers."  To main- 
tain consistency  with  previous  research  on human  resource  strategy (Lawler, 

1 Minimills  are relatively  small  steel-producing  facilities  in which  metal  scrap is melted  in 
electric  furnaces  and  continuously  cast  into  a variety  of  shapes  and  grades  of  steel.  Detailed 
discussion  of minimills  can  be  found  in  Barnett  and  Crandall  (1986)  and  Hogan  (1987).

1986;  Walton,  1985),  I have  labeled  those  systems  "control"  and  "commit- 
ment"  in  this  study. 

Control  and  commitment  represent  two  distinct  approaches  to  shaping 
employee  behaviors  and  attitudes  at  work.  The  goal  of  control  human  re- 
source  systems  is  to  reduce  direct  labor  costs,  or  improve  efficiency,  by 
enforcing  employee  compliance  with  specified  rules  and  procedures  and 
basing  employee  rewards  on  some  measurable  output  criteria  (Eisenhardt, 
1985;  Walton,  1985).  In  contrast,  commitment  human  resource  systems 
shape  desired  employee  behaviors  and  attitudes  by  forging  psychological 
links  between  organizational  and  employee  goals.  In other  words,  the  focus 
is  on  developing  committed  employees  who  can  be  trusted  to  use  their 
discretion  to  carry out  job tasks  in  ways  that  are consistent  with  organiza- 
tional  goals  (e.g.,  Organ,  1988). 

The  control  and  commitment  approaches  to  human  resource  manage- 
ment  are expected  to be represented  by  different  sets  of programs  and  prac- 
tices.  In my  previous  research  (Arthur,  1992)  I found  that  in  general,  com- 
mitment  human  resource  systems  were  characterized  by  higher  levels  of 
in  managerial  decisions,  formal  participation  pro- 
employee 
grams,  training  in  group  problem  solving,  and  socializing  activities  and  by 
higher  percentages  of maintenance,  or skilled,  employees  and  average  wage 
rates.  The  present  study's  methods  section  presents  further  details  of these 
system  patterns. 

involvement 

The  existence  of  the  control  and  commitment  variations  in  organiza- 
tions  is  generally  thought  to  be  associated  with  certain  organizational  con- 
ditions.  Most  human  resource  strategy  researchers  have  taken  a behavioral 
perspective  (cf.  Snell,  1992).  Research  using  this  perspective  rests  on  the 
often  implicit  assumption  that  the  successful  implementation  of  a business 
strategy  requires  a unique  set  of  employee  behaviors  and  attitudes  and  that 
a unique  set  of  human  resource  policies  and  practices  will  elicit  those  be- 
haviors  and  attitudes  (Cappelli  & Singh,  1992).  Alternatively,  control  theory 
researchers  (e.g., Eisenhardt,  1985; Ouchi,  1979;  Snell,  1992)  have  noted  that 
the  use  of  a  control  system  depends  on  managers  having  a relatively  com- 
plete  knowledge  of the transformation  process  (inputs  to outputs)  and a high 
ability  to  effectively  set  performance  standards  and  measure  employee  out- 
puts.  These  conditions  enable  employers  to  directly  monitor  and  reward 
employee  behavior  or the  specific  outcomes  of that behavior.  In the  absence 
of  these  conditions,  an  input,  or clan,  system  is  predicted,  in  which  selec- 
tion,  training,  and  socialization  policies  that try to align  employee  interests 
with  those  of the  firm  are emphasized  (Eisenhardt,  1985). 
Hypotheses 

Human  resource  systems  and  manufacturing  performance.  Although 
the  above  theoretical  approaches  suggest  a contingency  view  of  human  re- 
source  system  effectiveness,  there  are a number  of reasons  to believe  that  a 
smoothly  functioning  commitment  human  resource  system  will  be  associ- 
ated  with  higher  organizational  performance  than  will  a control  system,  the

more traditional  human  resource  approach  in manufacturing  (Walton,  1985). 
By  decentralizing  managerial  decision  making,  setting  up  formal  participa- 
tion  mechanisms,  and  providing  the  proper training  and rewards,  a commit- 
ment  system  can  lead  to  a  highly  motivated  and  empowered  work  force 
whose  goals  are closely  aligned  with  those  of management  (Thomas  & Velt- 
house,  1990).  Thus,  the resources  required  to monitor  employee  compliance, 
such  as  those  needed  to  maintain  supervision  and  work  rules,  can  be  re- 
duced  (Locke  & Schweiger,  1979).  In addition,  employees  under  these  con- 
ditions  are thought  to be more  likely  to engage  in  organizational  citizenship 
behaviors  (Organ, 1988),  nonrole,  unrewarded  behaviors  that are believed  to 
be,  nonetheless,  critical  to  organizational  success  (e.g.,  Katz,  1964). 

A parallel  set  of arguments  on the  superior  performance  of commitment 
systems  can  be  found  in  the  recent  industrial  relations 
literature  (e.g., 
Kochan,  Katz,  & McKersie,  1986).  Management's  attempt  to  implement  a 
classic  control  system  for  reducing  labor  costs  by  unilaterally 
increasing 
performance  standards  and  maintaining  wages  and  benefits  is  likely  to  be 
met by strong resistance  from a unionized  work force.  Resistance  in the form 
of  strikes,  high  grievance  rates,  and  adversarial  labor  relations  have  been 
found  to  be  extremely  costly  to  firms  in  terms  of  productivity  and  quality 
(Cooke,  1992;  Katz, Kochan,  & Weber,  1985). 

Finally,  although  there  continues  to  be  debate  concerning  the  condi- 
tions  under  which  the  participative  management  practices  associated  with 
commitment  systems  are  effective  (e.g.,  Levine  & Tyson,  1990;  Locke  & 
Schweiger,  1979),  recent  evidence  suggests  that  these  practices  are  espe- 
cially  critical  for the  effective  implementation  and  utilization  of  advanced 
(Majchrzak,  1988;  Dean  &  Snell,  1991).  The 
manufacturing 
present  study  focused  specifically  on  manufacturing  performance,  defined 
by two  production-process-related  measures  of organizational  effectiveness, 
labor efficiency  and scrap rate. These  performance  outcomes  are predicted  to 
be  most  directly  affected  by  differences  in  employee  behaviors  and  charac- 
teristics  as  shaped  by  systems  of human  resource  activities. 

technology 

Hypothesis  1: Plants  with  commitment  human  resource 
systems  will  have  better manufacturing  performance  than 
plants  with  control  human  resource  systems. 

Human  resource  systems  and  turnover.  A  vast  literature  exists  on  the 
determinants  of  employee  turnover,  long  considered  an  important  outcome 
for both  individuals  and  organizations.  Most  of this  research  has  focused  on 
individual-level  variables,  such  as  employees'  satisfaction  with  their  jobs 
and  their  organizational  commitment  (e.g.,  Cotton  & Tuttle,  1986).  In  this 
work,  I tested  the  proposition  that  organization-level  human  resource  char- 
acteristics  are also  significantly  related  to  the  overall  turnover  in  firms,  ex- 
pecting  higher  turnover  in  organizations  with  control  systems  than  in  those 
with  commitment  systems. 

The  basis  for  this  prediction  is  the  different  objectives  of  control  and 
commitment  systems  as  manifested  in  different  combinations  of human  re-

source  policies  and  practices.  As  noted  above,  the  driving  force  behind  a 
control  system  is  to  reduce  direct  labor  costs.  This  goal  is  expected  to  be 
manifested  in  the  use  of  relatively  simple,  well-defined 
job tasks.  Because 
employees  with  a minimum  amount  of training  and  experience  can  perform 
such  tasks,  wages  and  the  costs  of  employee  search,  selection,  and  training 
can  also  be  minimized.  Under  these  conditions,  the  costs  of employee  turn- 
over to a firm are expected  to be relatively  low,  so employers  have  very  little 
incentive  to  try to  minimize  turnover  through  human  resource  policies  and 
policies  designed  to  increase  employee  commitment  or attachment.  In fact, 
employee  commitment  might  be  considered  dysfunctional  since  compensa- 
tion  is generally  higher  for senior  employees  than for similarly  qualified  new 
employees. 

Hypothesis  2:  Turnover  will  be  higher  in  control  human 
resource  systems  than  in  commitment  human  resource 
systems. 

Turnover  and  manufacturing  performance.  Since  the  late  1970s,  re- 
search  on  the  consequences  of  employee  turnover  has  generally  compared 
the  cost  and  performance  of  individuals  who  leave  an  organization  with 
those  of  (1) their  replacements,  (2) those  who  stay  with  the  organization,  or 
(3)  both  (e.g.,  Boudreau  & Berger,  1985;  Hollenbeck  & Williams,  1986).  A 
potential  limitation  of this  approach  is  that the  effect  of organizational  con- 
text  is  largely  ignored.  In other words,  the  departure  of an individual  with  a 
given  level  of  assessed  performance  is  assumed  to  have  the  same  effect  on 
organizational  performance  across  organizations. 

In  contrast,  the  human  resource  strategy  perspective  suggests  that  the 
effect  of turnover  level  on  organizational  performance  depends  critically  on 
the  nature  of the  context  or system  in  which  the  turnover  occurs  (cf. Miller 
& Friesen,  1984).  System  characteristics  can be  seen  as  affecting  the  perfor- 
mance  impact  of a number  of the  predicted  consequences  of turnover,  such 
as  disruption  of  social  and  communication  structures,  training  and  assimi- 
lation  costs,  and  decreased  cohesion  and  commitment  of members  who  stay 
(Dalton  & Todor,  1979; Mobley,  1982; Staw,  1980).  For example,  the fact that 
the  jobs in  organizations  with  commitment  systems  often  require  high  train- 
ing  and  skill  levels  suggests  a stronger  relationship  between  organizational 
tenure  and  performance  than  exists  in  control  systems.  Individuals  in  such 
jobs  will  take  longer  to  reach  top  performance  than  individuals 
in  the  sim- 
pler  jobs  of  control  systems  (Campion,  1989). 

In addition,  because  production  employees  in commitment  systems  take 
on  more  managerial-level  decision-making  tasks,  their  organizational  cen- 
trality,  and  hence  the  potential  for their  departure  to  disrupt  organizational 
is  expected  to  be  greater  than  the  disruptive  potential  of  the 
functioning, 
in  a  control  human  resource  system  who  does  not  have 
typical  employee 
these  vertical  task  responsibilities. 

Hypothesis  3: There  will  be  a  stronger  negative  relation- 
ship  between  turnover  level  and  manufacturing  perfor-

mance  in  commitment  human  resource  systems  than  in 
control  human  resource  systems. 

METHODS 

The  data  used  for  this  study  come  primarily  from  questionnaire  re- 
sponses  by  human  resource  managers  at  30  of  the  54  existing  U.S.  steel 
minimills.  Data  were  gathered  between  November  1988  and  March  1989. 
The  average age, size,  geographic  region  represented,  and union  status  of the 
mills  surveyed  are not  statistically  different  from those  of the  total  minimill 
population  (Arthur,  1992). 

The  modal  minimill  firm  is  an  independent,  privately  held  U.S.  firm 
that  owns  one  minimill.  There  are,  however,  a  growing  number  of  larger 
domestic  (and  some  foreign)  companies  that  own  multiple  plants  (Hogan, 
1987).  Because  of  the  possibility  that  a  manager's  scope  of  responsibility 
might  span  several  mill  locations,  managers  were  specifically 
instructed  to 
direct  their  comments  only  to  the  mill  location  to  which  the  questionnaire 
was  addressed.  In  addition,  a  different  set  of  managers  provided  data  for 
each  mill  so that in no case were  data from more than one mill  collected  from 
a single  manager.2 
Measures 

Minimill  human  resource  systems.  In Arthur (1992),  I used  the minimill 
questionnaire  data  to  construct  ten  variables  measuring  various  aspects  of 
mills'  workplace  human  resource  systems.  Table  1  defines  these  variables, 
which  I  standardized  and  submitted  to  a  cluster  analysis  using  Ward's 
method  in  order  to  empirically  identify  the  minimill  human  resource  sys- 
tems.  This  procedure  yielded  a  six-cluster  solution  based  in  part  on  an 
analysis  of the  change  in  the  fusion  coefficient,  defined  as the  error sums  of 
square  for this  procedure  (Arthur,  1992:  504). 

Theoretical  considerations,  such  as  a  desire  to  test  for  differences  be- 
tween  two  dominant  human  resource  systems,  and  sample  size  limitations 
(degrees  of  freedom  were  not  available  to  include  all  six  clusters  in  the 
analysis)  required  some  additional  data aggregation.  I accomplished  this  by 
categorizing  the  patterns  of cluster  scores  into  control  and  commitment  sys- 
tems.  As  reported  in  my  previous  study,  this  judgment  was  informed  by 
descriptions  of  alternate  forms  of control  and  commitment  human  resource 
systems  found  in  the  relevant  literature  as well  as by  detailed  primary  and 
secondary  case  descriptions  of the  mills. 

Conceptually,  this  method  of  data  aggregation  is  consistent  with  the 

2  Some  recent  studies  have  found  that  different  human  resource  practices  may  be  applied 
to different  occupational  and functional  groups  within  firms  (ackson  et al.,  1989;  Snell  & Dean, 
1992).  Because  this  study  only  focused  on  the  maintenance  and  production  workers  in  min- 
imills,  I could  not  assess  the  possibility  that  different  sets  of  human  resource  activities  were 
applied  to  other  functional  and  occupational  groups  in  the  organizations.

on  its  overall  pattern  or context  (cf. Miller  & Friesen,  1984).  This  freedom  is 
especially  useful  for interpreting  a variable  such  as due process  (see Table  1), 
which  means  different  things  in  union  and  nonunion  contexts  (Arthur, 
1992).  By  examining  the  complete  pattern  of  scores  as  well  as  the  union 
status  of the  different  clusters,  I could  identify  human  resource  cluster  pat- 
terns  that  were  consistent  with  the  descriptions  of  alternate  forms  (union 
and  nonunion)  for achieving  cost  control  and  employee  commitment  found 
in  the  human  resource  and  industrial  relations  strategy  literature. 

As Table  1 shows,  the pattern of scores  for the aggregated clusters  shows 
considerable  face  validity,  appearing  to  match  the  descriptions  of  control 
and  commitment  systems  provided  earlier.  All  the  mean  differences  be- 
tween  the  two  cluster  groupings  are in  the  predicted  directions.  In particu- 
lar, the  average  scores  on  measures  of  decentralizing  decision  making,  gen- 
eralized  training,  skill,  and  wage  rate are all  significantly  higher  in  commit- 
ment  systems  than  in  control  systems.  The  value  of  the  bonus  variable  is 
significantly  higher  for  control  systems,  which  is  consistent  with  the  exis- 
tence  of  an  output  control  strategy  (Eisenhardt,  1985). 

Additional  evidence  for the  validity  of  the  cluster  groupings  was  pro- 
vided  in  Arthur  (1992)  by  a significant  biserial  correlation  between  two  of 
Porter's  (1980)  business  strategies,  low  cost  and  differentiation,  and  the  ag- 
gregated  cluster  groupings  (r  =  .46,  p  <  .05).  As  predicted,  mills  with  low- 
cost  business  strategies  were  more  likely  to  have  control  human  resource 
systems,  and  mills  with  differentiation  strategies  were  more  likely  to  have 
commitment  human  resource  systems.  Business  strategy  data  for  the  mills 
from  the  data  on  human  resource  practices. 
were  gathered  independently 
This  evidence  of predictive  validity  is  especially  relevant  for use  with  clus- 
ter  analysis  results  that,  in  the  absence  of  statistical  tests  for  the  "right" 
number  of clusters,  must  be judged  primarily  on their  usefulness  in  predict- 
ing outcomes  of variables  not used  in the clustering  procedure  (cf. Aldender- 
fer & Blashfield,  1984). 

To  help  determine  the  reliability  of the  categorization,  I gave  six  raters 
(advanced  graduate  students  in  human  resource  and  organizational  behav- 
ior)  a  questionnaire  that  included  the  descriptions  of  control  and  commit- 
ment  systems  and  asked  them  to  judge  independently  whether  each  of  the 
six  patterns  of  standardized  variable  scores  presented  in  Arthur  (1992)  rep- 
resented  control  or  commitment.  The  six  raters  unanimously  selected  the 
category  used  in this  study  for five  of the  six  cluster  patterns,  and five  of the 
six raters correctly  categorized  the sixth  cluster.  These  results  indicate  a very 
high  degree  of  interrater reliability  for the  human  resource  system  categori- 
zation  used  in  this  study.  In the  analysis,  control  systems  were  coded  0 and 
commitment  systems,  1.

Manufacturing  performance  and  turnover.  The  respondents  were  also 
asked  to report on their  mills'  labor efficiency,  scrap rate, and turnover  over 
the  year  before  the  survey.  The  variable  labor  hours  was  defined  as  the 
average number  of labor hours  (both direct  and indirect)  required  to produce 
one  ton  of steel  at a mill.  Scrap rate was  the  number  of tons  of raw steel  that 
had  to be  melted  to  produce  one  ton  of finished  product.  Industry  journals, 
interviews  with  mill  managers,  and  pretest  feedback  indicated  that  these 
were  common  performance  metrics  used  in  the  industry  with  which  top 
human  resource  managers  would  be familiar.  Because  only  human  resource 
managers  were  asked  to  report  on  these  measures,  however,  interrater  reli- 
ability  could  not  be  assessed.3 

The managers  were  also  asked to indicate  the number  of production  and 
maintenance  employees  who  had  "left the  mill  (either  voluntarily  or invol- 
untarily)  over  the  past year." This  figure  was  divided  by the  total  number  of 
production  and  maintenance  employees 
in  a mill,  derived  from  a separate 
question  asked  at the  beginning  of the  questionnaire,  to  measure  turnover. 
Control  variables.  The  age,  size,  union  status,  and  business  strategy  of 
the  mills  were  included  as control  variables.  Age  was  the  number  of years  a 
mill  had  been  in  existence 
(1993  minus  year  of  founding).  Data  for  this 
measure  were  gathered  from  archival  sources  (Hogan,  1987;  International 
Trade  Administration,  1986).  It is  included  in  the  model  as  a proxy  for the 
newness  and  sophistication  of the  plant  design  and  production  technology. 
Size  was  the  number  of  employees  at each  mill  reported  by  its  human  re- 
source  manager. 

Union  status  and  business  strategy  were  expected  to  vary  with  the  hu- 
man  resource  system  variable  and  to  have  potential  direct  effects  on  manu- 
facturing  performance.  Union  status  data  were  gathered  from  secondary 
sources  (e.g., Hogan,  1987);  47  percent  of the  minimills  studied  were  union- 
ized.  In  all  but  one  of  the  unionized  mills,  production  and  maintenance 
employees  were  represented  by  the  United  Steelworkers  of America. 

Business  strategy data were  gathered  through  the use  of a separate  ques- 
tionnaire  completed  by the top line  manager at each  minimill.  I then  cluster- 
analyzed  these  data  and  used  them  to  classify  the  mills  into  low-cost  and 
differentiation  strategy  categories  following  the  work  of  Porter  (1980)  and 
others  (e.g.,  Dess  & Davis,  1984).  Details  of  the  business  strategy  variables 

3 Two  studies,  however,  have  reported  performance  levels  for minimills  measured  at the 
industry  level  very  similar  to  those  found  in  this  study  and  thus  provide  some  support  for the 
validity  and reliability  of the performance  measures.  The average productivity  rate of 2.35  labor 
hours  per  ton  in  this  study  compares  favorably  with  the  average  of  approximately  2.00  labor 
hours  per  ton  found  in  Hogan's  (1987)  survey  of  U.S.  minimill  firms.  A  U.S.  Department  of 
Commerce  study  also  supports  the  validity  of the  average  scrap rate of  18 percent  found  in this 
study,  reporting  an 80 percent  "yield  of raw steel  to finished  product"  (a 20 percent  scrap  rate) 
in  U.S.  minimills 
(International  Trade  Administration,  1986:  12).  However,  given  the  lack  of 
independently  reported  plant-level  performance  data with  which  to  assess  the  reliability  and 
validity  of  the  performance  measures  over  a  specified  period  of  time,  readers  may  want  to 
exercise  some  caution  in  interpreting  these  results.

and classifications  are presented  in Table 2. The strategy and union  variables 
were  coded  as  dichotomous  variables,  with  1  equaling  the  presence  of  a 
union  and  a differentiation  business  strategy,  respectively. 

Table  3 presents  the means,  standard  deviations,  and correlations  for all 

the  dependent  and  independent  variables  in  the  study. 

RESULTS 

Hypothesis  1  predicts  that  the  presence  of  a  commitment  human  re- 
source  system  will  be  related  to  significantly  higher  manufacturing  perfor- 
mance  than  the  presence  of  a control  system.  I tested  this  hypothesis  using 
regression  analysis  for  labor  hours  and  scrap  rate  in  models  that  included 
system  type  and  the  control  variables.4  Table  4 presents  results  of the  anal- 
yses.  The  negative  coefficients  for  the  human  resource  system  variable  in 
both models  indicates  that commitment  is significantly  related  to both fewer 
labor hours  per ton  and  lower  scrap  rates. Because  the  results  of the  overall 
regression  model  for scrap rate are not  significant,  however,  the  significance 
of  the  human  resource  system  variable  in  this  model  must  be  interpreted 
with  some  caution. 

The  second  hypothesis  predicts  that  turnover  will  be  higher  in  min- 
imills  with  control  systems  than  in  those  with  commitment  systems.  Turn- 
over  was  over  twice  as high  in  the  former  (x  =  .07,  s.d.  =  .07,  control,  and 
x  =  .03,  s.d.  =  .03,  commitment).  A  t-test  showed  that  this  difference  was 
statistically  significant  (t  =  2.19,  p  <  .05). 

Finally,  Hypothesis  3 states that the negative  relationship  between  turn- 
over  and  manufacturing  performance  will  be  higher  in  commitment  human 
resource  systems  than  in  control  systems.  Table  5  presents  the  results  of  a 
moderated  regression  analysis  that included  the main  effects  of turnover  and 
system  and  their  multiplicative 
interaction.  Union  status  was  used  as a con- 
trol variable  in this  analysis  because  previous  research  has found  that union- 
ization  is  related  to  both  turnover  level  and  manufacturing  performance 
(e.g.,  Freeman  & Medoff,  1984).  The  interaction  term  is  significant  for both 
labor hours  and  scrap  rate,  and  its  inclusion  results  in  a significant  change 
in  R2. 

Table  6  shows  results  of  a  comparison  of  the  sizes  of  the  correlations 
between  turnover  and  performance  in  the  two  types  of  system,  with  union 
status  again  controlled.  This  subgroup  comparison  was  appropriate  for test- 
ing  the  strength  of the  moderating  effect  of system  type  (Arnold,  1982).  The 
table  shows  significant,  positive  correlations  between  turnover  and  both 
labor  hours  and  scrap  rate  for  minimills  with  commitment 
manufacturing  performance  is worse  the  higher  the  turnover.  For mills  with 
control  systems,  the  correlations  are  negative  and  insignificant.  Results  of 

systems- 

4  Missing data reduced the number of usable observations by three in  the  labor hours 
equation and by six in the scrap rate equation. The mills with missing data were not statistically 
different from the rest of those studied in age, size, or union status.

others  concerning  the  effectiveness  of  commitment-type  human  resource 
systems,  at  least  in  the  context  of  manufacturing  plants  using  technologi- 
cally  intensive  and  relatively  integrated  continuous  production  processes 
(e.g.,  Dean  & Snell,  1991).  Interestingly,  no  tradeoff  between  production 
quality  and  efficiency  emerged.  Commitment  was  associated  with  both 
lower  scrap  rates  and  higher  labor efficiency  than  control. 

In addition,  the  significant  differences  found  between  the  two  types  of 
systems  in  both  turnover  and  the  relationship  between  turnover  and  manu- 
facturing  performance  suggest  the  importance  of  including  a  measure  of 
human  resource  system  as  a  moderator  in  future  research  on  the  conse- 
quences  of turnover.  These  results  support  the recent  observations  of a num- 
ber  of  researchers  who  have  noted  the  importance  of  identifying  organiza- 
tion-level  consequences  of  employee  turnover  (e.g.,  Dalton  & Todor,  1979; 
Mobley,  1982;  Schwab,  1991). 

Finally,  the  lack  of a significant  correlation  between  turnover  and  man- 
ufacturing  performance  in  control  systems  may  indicate  a  nonlinear  rela- 
tionship  between  these  two  variables.  In  other  words,  organizations  with 
control  human  resource  systems  may  benefit  from  high  employee  turnover 
up  to  some  point,  but  after that  point  is  reached  there  begins  to  be  a detri- 
mental  effect  on  manufacturing  performance.  In contrast,  the  results  show  a 
negative  linear  relationship  between  turnover  and  manufacturing  perfor- 
mance  in  the  commitment  systems.  The  finding  that  the  right  amount  of 
turnover  varies  with  system  type  has  important  implications  for practition- 
ers  seeking  to  manage  this  process. 
Limitations  and  Future  Research 

The  relatively  small  number  of  existing  minimills 

limited  the  types  of 
statistical  analyses  possible,  including  the  use  of  a full  set  of  control  vari- 
ables  in  testing  Hypotheses  2 and  3. In addition,  the  specific  characteristics 
of  the  organizations  studied  limit  the  generalizability  of  these  results.  To 
what  extent  do the  human  resource  systems  found  in this  study  also  exist  in 
large public  sector  organizations  such  as schools  and  hospitals?  What  is  the 
relationship  between  human  resource  system  and  organizational  perfor- 
mance  in  less  technologically 
intensive,  service-oriented  organizations?  Fi-

nal  evaluation  of the  evidence  for the  human  resource  strategy  perspective 
will  need  to  await  the  accumulation  of  results  from  studies  conducted 
in 
multiple  industry  contexts. 

In  addition,  although  the  findings  of  this  study  are  consistent  with  a 
conceptual  model  in  which  the  choice  of  human  resource  system  leads  to 
changes  in  manufacturing  performance,  the  cross-sectional  data  used  here 
did  not permit  any tests  of the  causal  ordering between  effects  of system  and 
performance.  It is  possible  that better performing  mills  also  have  additional 
resources  that  facilitate  management's  choosing  commitment  systems. 

Further,  research  progress  on  the  human  resource  strategy  perspective 
depends  critically  on  the  development  of  conceptually  and  methodologi- 
cally  sound  measures  of the human  resource  system  construct.  Although  the 
taxonomy  used  in  this  study  shows  some  conceptual  and  predictive  prom- 
ise,  much  more  work  needs  to be  done  concerning  definition  and  measure- 
ment  of  the  dimensions  of  human  resource  systems.  A  key  related  issue  is 
the  performance  implications  of  mixed  systems.  A  premise  of  this  work  is 
that  control  and  commitment  represent  conceptually  distinct  ideal  systems 
and  that  any  deviation  from  the  ideal  types  will  weaken  performance.  Al- 
ternatively,  control  and  commitment  can  be  conceptualized  as the  opposite 
ends  of  a  continuum  of  possible  human  resource  systems  and  the  most 
effective  system  seen  as  existing  somewhere  between  the  two  extremes.5 
Empirical  tests  are needed  to  determine  which  conceptualization  more  ac- 
curately  describes  the  construct. 

Other  parts  of  the  human  resource  strategy  model  are  also  in  need  of 
empirical  investigation.  For  example,  because  of  sample  size  limitations,  I 
was  unable  in this  study  to test for the  performance  effects  of the fit between 
business  strategy  and  human  resource  strategy.  Finally,  there  is  a  need  to 
demonstrate  that  certain  combinations  of  human  resource  programs,  poli- 
cies,  and  practices  lead  to specific  employee  attitudes,  such  as trust in man- 
agement  or  organizational  commitment,  that  in  turn  lead  to  specific  em- 
ployee  behaviors  beneficial  to  effectively 
implementing  a  given  business 
strategy. Exploring  these  intermediate  links  explicitly  will  undoubtedly  lead 
to further refinements  and  insights  into  the  process  by which  combinations 
of  human  resource  activities  can  lead  to  competitive  advantages  for  firms 
(e.g.,  Cappelli  & Singh,  1992). 
Conclusions 

In spite  of its  limitations,  this  research  shows  that  a number  of insights 
can be  gained  through  the  use  of a human  resource  strategy  perspective  and 
methodology.  By empirically  testing  whether  certain  combinations  of activ- 
ities  are associated  with  higher  manufacturing  performance,  this  study  pro- 
vides  one  of the first pieces  of empirical  evidence  with  which  to evaluate  the 
prescriptions  in  the  human  resource  strategy  literature.  Many  authors  have

called  for  such  evidence  (Dobbins  et  al.,  1991;  Fisher,  1989;  Jackson  et  al., 
1989;  Lengnick-Hall  & Lengnick-Hall,  1988;  Snell  & Dean,  1992;  Wright  & 
McMahan,  1992).  In  addition,  the  study  has  shown  that  identification  of 
human  resource  systems  promises  to add  significantly  to understanding  the 
relationship  between  turnover  and  organizational  performance.  Although 
these  results  should  be  seen  as preliminary  because  of data limitations,  this 
study  provides  future  researchers  with  some  empirical  evidence  supporting 
a promising  new  perspective  with  which  to study  important  human  resource 
and  organizational  outcomes.
