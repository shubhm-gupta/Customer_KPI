 A RESOURCE-BASED PERSPECTIVE ON

 CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

 AND PROFITABILITY

 Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we posited that envi-
 ronmental performance and economic performance are positively
 linked and that industry growth moderates the relationship, with the
 returns to environmental performance higher in high-growth indus-
 tries. We tested these hypotheses with an analysis of 243 firms over two
 years, using independently developed environmental ratings. Results
 indicate that "it pays to be green" and that this relationship strengthens
 with industry growth. We conclude by highlighting the study's aca-
 demic and managerial implications, making special reference to the
 social issues in management literature.

 Although the basic tenet of corporate social responsibility is that society
 and business are tightly interwoven (Wood, 1991), scholars are still strug-
 gling to specify the precise mechanisms linking firms and society. Within
 this conversation, a central issue has been the economic impact on a firm of
 its social policies. In this article, we focus on the economic impacts of
 environmental performance, a specific social issue that has provoked a very
 public debate. On the one hand, it has been forcefully argued that environ-
 mental regulation enhances economic performance in an efficiency-
 producing, innovation-stimulating symbiotic relationship (Gore, 1993; Por-
 ter, 1991). On the other hand, regulations are assailed as generating costs that
 businesses will never recover, representing financial diversions from vital
 productive investments (Gingrich, 1995; Walley & Whitehead, 1994).

 A number of empirical studies performed in this area have returned
 differing verdicts. Several studies have shown no significant link between
 measures of environmental performance and profitability (Fogler & Nutt,
 1975; Rockness, Schlachter, & Rockness, 1986) or between environmental
 performance and corporate disclosure practices (Freedman & Jaggi, 1982;

 We wish to express our appreciation to the Franklin Research and Development Corpora-
 tion for allowing us to use their proprietary database and to Roger Chope and Steven Matsunaga
 for assistance with methodological issues. We also thank Thomas Dean, Neil Fargher, David

 Wiseman, 1982). But other studies have shown that better pollution perfor-
 mance improved profitability (Bragdon & Marlin, 1972; Spicer, 1978a) and
 reduced risks (Spicer, 1978b) and that federal compliance liability costs and
 profitability were negatively related (Holman, New, & Singer, 1985). One can
 challenge these prior studies on methodological grounds. All but one used
 small, single-industry samples. More importantly, they have frequently re-
 lied on self-reported data, failed to control for other predictors of profitabil-
 ity, and used questionable social responsibility measures (Wood & Jones,
 1995). These methodological shortcomings may be responsible for results to
 date that have shown an equivocal relationship between environmental per-
 formance and economic performance.1

 Wood and Jones (1995) argued that this inconclusiveness is primarily
 due to a key conceptual shortcoming, failure to carefully trace how the social
 policies examined directly influence firms' bottom lines. For example, we
 would expect that any external imposition of fines or additional compliance
 costs would drive down profits, thus accounting for the significant effects of
 these costs found in several of the studies just cited. We agree with Wood
 and Jones that there are conceptual flaws in prior research, but we also
 suggest that the relationship is more complex than a simple calculus equat-
 ing higher costs with lower profits. After all, if the sole driving force for a
 corporate environmental policy is minimizing tangible pollution costs, then
 any firm going beyond compliance would forfeit the profits it could gain
 from simply (and legally) continuing to externalize those costs. Our argu-
 ment, based on the resource-based view of the firm, highlights the role en-
 vironmental policy plays in generating broader organizational advantages
 that allow a firm to capture premium profits. In a sense, it could be said that
 the same policies that internalize negative environmental spillovers can pay
 off by simultaneously generating greater positive organizational spillovers
 that accrue internally and privately to the firm. Thus, for both methodologi-
 cal and conceptual reasons, a careful study of the relationship between en-
 vironmental performance and economic performance is both timely and
 potentially of great value.

 The resource-based view of the firm offers corporate social responsibil-
 ity researchers a tool for refining the analysis of how corporate social policy
 influences the bottom line for two reasons. First, the resource-based view has
 a strong focus on performance as the key outcome variable. And second, like
 the social responsibility literature, work adopting the resource-based view
 explicitly recognizes the importance of intangible concepts, such as know-
 how (Teece, 1980), corporate culture (Barney, 1986), and reputation (Hall,
 1992). These theoretical complementarities offer a significant opportunity

 1 Two working papers (Hart & Ahuja, 1994; Cohen, Fenn, & Naimon, 1995) have also

 addressed the environment-performance relationship, with mixed results. The equivocality of
 results in this area extends to other social issues, such as corporate philanthropy and commu-
 nity relations. Ullman (1985), Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield (1985), and most recently, Wood
 and Jones (1995) have offered surveys of empirical work in this area.

 that we hoped to exploit in this study, which spotlights the environmental
 performance-economic performance relationship. Further, we explored in-
 dustry growth as a moderator of this relationship, theorizing that firms are
 less likely to reap benefits from increased environmental performance when
 industry growth is low. But before formally stating these predictions, we
 briefly outline the resource-based theory of competitive advantage.

 A RESOURCE-BASED VIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE

 AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

 The Resource-Based View of Competitive Advantage

 The resource-based view of the firm grew out of a frustration with the
 structure-conduct-performance paradigm of the industrial organization (IO)
 view of the firm (Bain, 1959; Porter, 1980). The early resource-based theo-
 rists found the IO view-that a firm's success was wholly determined by its
 external environment-to be unrealistically limited and turned to the semi-
 nal work of Penrose (1959) for motivation. To counter the IO view, Werner-
 felt (1984), Dierickx and Cool (1989), and Prahalad and Hamel (1990) built
 resource-based theory around the internal competencies of firms. In these
 contributions to resource-based theory, competitive advantage is rooted in-
 side a firm, in assets that are valuable and inimitable. A firm's capabilities or
 competencies and management's abilities to marshal these assets to produce
 superior performance determine competitive advantage (Grant, 1991). In the
 drive to add depth and breadth to this internal view, theorists have noted but
 left somewhat vague the role of a firm's links to its external environment.

 Barney's (1986) work addressed this issue by pinpointing the conditions
 under which a firm's resources become valuable by bringing the external
 environment into the resource-based picture. In developing the notion of
 external factor markets, he noted that, contrary to the IO model, external
 resource analysis alone cannot lead to valuable resources. However, by nur-
 turing internal competencies and applying them to an appropriate external
 environment, a firm can develop a viable strategy. Thus, for a firm's resource
 to become valuable, it must allow the firm to "exploit opportunities or neu-
 tralize threats" in the firm's environment (Barney, 1991: 106). The link in
 resource-based theory between the competitive environment and firm capa-
 bilities was made more explicit by Conner (1991), in her comparison of the
 resource-based view and the IO and Chicago models. She observed that all
 three recognize the external constraints of demand conditions and public
 policy on strategy. For Conner, the task for resource-based theorists is to
 discern the appropriate rent-generating inputs given both external (e.g., de-
 mand, public policy, and competitor action) and internal (e.g., past history,
 resource endowments, and corporate culture) constraints.

 Thus, in its current state, the resource-based view addresses the fit be-
 tween what a firm has the ability to do and what it has the opportunity to do.
 To quote Collis and Montgomery, "Resources cannot be evaluated in isola-
 tion, because their value is determined in the interplay with market forces.

 A resource that is valuable in a particular industry or at a particular time
 might fail to have the same value in a different industry or chronological
 context" (1995: 120).

 In the resource-based view, resources are classified as tangible, intan-
 gible, and personnel-based (Grant, 1991). Tangible resources include finan-
 cial reserves and physical resources such as plant, equipment, and stocks
 of raw materials. Intangible resources include reputation, technology, and
 human resources; the latter include culture, the training and expertise of
 employees, and their commitment and loyalty. As these resources are not
 productive on their own, the analysis also needs to consider a firm's organ-
 izational capabilities-its abilities to assemble, integrate, and manage these
 bundles of resources. In our application of the resource-based view, we
 considered resources and capabilities in the following combinations: (1)
 physical assets and the technologies and skills required to use them, (2)
 human resources and organizational capabilities, which include culture,
 commitment, and capabilities for integration and communication, and (3)
 the intangible resources of reputation and political acumen.

 Previous applications of resource-based theory to evaluation of environ-
 mental policies and strategy have concentrated on internal analysis of firms
 (Porter, 1991; Shrivastava, 1995a). However, Hart (1995) expanded the re-
 source-based view of the firm to include the constraints imposed and op-
 portunities offered by the biophysical environment. In his theory, he pro-
 vided a schema that links the imperative of capturing a competitive advan-
 tage with the goal of securing and enhancing social legitimacy. He viewed
 external stakeholders as playing a pivotal role in moving corporations to-
 ward sustainability. The logical extension of this argument is that viewing
 societal demands as part of the external environment facing a firm trying to
 develop unique resources leads to expectations about when such resources
 will be valuable and inimitable. We suggest this is particularly true when
 society is demanding a cleaner environment.

 In developing our theory, we found it useful to bear in mind two modes
 of environmental policy advanced by Hart (1995). The first is the compliance
 strategy, wherein firms rely on pollution abatement through a short-term,
 "end-of-pipe" approach, often resisting the enactment and enforcement of
 environmental legislation. Firms often fall short of compliance in this mode.
 The second mode of environmental policy is going beyond compliance to a
 focus on prevention, a systemic approach that emphasizes source reduction
 and process innovation (Hart, 1995). Our position is that firms that tend
 toward the compliance mode will differ in their resource bases from those
 that tend toward prevention and that this policy choice will affect firms'
 ability to generate profits.

 Corporate Environmental Performance and Profitability

 Physical assets and technology. The resources and capabilities required
 to implement a firm's environmental policy vary radically, depending on
 whether or not that firm goes beyond compliance to embrace pollution pre-

 vention. End-of-pipe compliance policies affect only physical asset re-
 sources, which consist of the "physical technology used in a firm, a firm's
 plant and equipment, its geographic location, and its access to raw materi-
 als" (Barney, 1991). Compliance is achieved primarily by the addition of
 pollution-removing or filtering devices to the existing assets of a firm and
 does not require the firm to develop expertise or skills in managing new
 environmental technologies or processes. The technology is essentially self-
 contained, off-the-shelf hardware. Once such hardware is installed, it does
 not fundamentally vary production or service delivery processes. Thus, the
 implementation of this policy is straightforward and leaves a firm essentially
 in the same resource and capability situation it was in before it adopted the
 policy (Groenewegen & Vergragt, 1991; Kemp, 1993).

 As a proactive environmental policy takes hold in a firm, we would
 expect it to redesign its production or service delivery processes. Such a
 redesign would likely involve the acquisition and installation of new tech-
 nologies. Within this schema, the resource-based view of the firm provides
 a solid foundation for the hypothesis that improved environmental perfor-
 mance can enhance economic performance. Physical resources can be a
 source of competitive advantage if they "outperform" equivalent assets
 within competitors. The resource-based prediction would be that, if pur-
 chased from a third party, a physical asset itself cannot produce premium
 profits, as that technology is presumably available to competitors. However,
 if new physical assets are deployed in a way that allows a firm to capitalize
 on and enhance its internal methods for waste reduction and operational and
 fuel efficiency, such advantages are less transparent. And this method of
 deployment is likely to be the case within firms stressing prevention. Indeed,
 these internal routines represent the type of causally ambiguous resource
 (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990) that is central to the resource-based view of com-
 petitive advantage. When internal routines and know-how accumulate, a
 firm's knowledge of pollution prevention deepens (Dean & Brown, 1995).
 Such knowledge lessens the risk of spills and other actionable offenses tak-
 ing place (Groenewegen & Vergragt, 1991; Shrivastava, 1995a).

 Human resources and organizational capabilities. Embracing the no-
 tion of improved environmental performance also requires a fundamental
 shift in a firm's culture and human resources and the organizational capa-
 bilities required to manage them. Management, R&D, production, and mar-
 keting all must be involved and committed if a firm is to implement a policy
 of using clean technologies (Ashford, 1993; Hart, 1995). Use of clean tech-
 nologies also adds complexity to production or delivery processes and re-
 quires increased skills from workers at all levels of the firm (Groenewegen &
 Vergragt, 1991). So prevention is a more comprehensive and socially com-
 plex process than compliance, necessitating significant employee involve-
 ment, cross-disciplinary coordination and integration, and a forward-
 thinking managerial style (Shrivastava, 1995b). For example, Hart (1995:
 996) discussed Xerox's policy of viewing its leased copiers as a source of
 high-quality inputs for its new copiers. Such a policy ties together design

 and manufacturing functions, along with those units responsible for inter-
 faces with customers, resulting in company-wide gains. The process of de-
 veloping a pollution prevention policy thus builds within a firm the re-
 sources of organizational commitment and learning, cross-functional inte-
 gration, and increased employee skills and participation, which, we argue,
 are emerging as prime resources in the modern competitive environment.

 A strong environmental stance can be expected to become part of an
 organization's image and identity and to guide the actions of its members
 (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). Such a stance can be expected to influence hu-
 man resource policies, in turn shaping job design, recruitment and selection,
 and training and development systems (Starik & Rands, 1995). In general,
 when a firm adopts a sophisticated human resource management strategy
 such as this, productivity improvements are captured (Koch & McGrath,
 1995). One reason may be that attracting top candidates is easier for firms
 known for environmental stewardship. According to Dechant and Altman:

 Employees' views on a firm's environmental performance and
 whether it fits their values profile frequently affects their will-
 ingness to work for that firm. A 1991 McKinsey study of 403
 senior executives from around the world revealed that sixty-
 eight percent of them agreed that "organizations with a poor
 environmental record will find it increasingly difficult to recruit
 and retain high caliber staff (McKinsey, 1991, cited in Gladwin,
 1993)." This perspective was validated by Mike Joyce, Division
 Director of Environmental Affairs for Dexter Corporation, who
 indicated that "college graduates are looking for more than just
 a paycheck, they are looking for companies with which they can
 identify morally and philosophically" (1994: 8).

 Intangible resources. Two intangible factors suggest that better environ-
 mental performance will augment profits. The first is that a reputation for
 leadership in environmental affairs will increase sales among customers
 who are sensitive to such issues. Indeed, such consumer actions appear to be
 increasingly frequent: although the phenomenon of consumers tying firms'
 social responsibility records to purchasing decisions is a relatively new one
 (Murray & Montanari, 1986), it is reported to be gaining steam (Economist,
 1994).2 The publication of popular handbooks, such as The Green Consumer
 Supermarket Guide, and the implementation of independent rating pro-
 grams, such as Green Cross and Green Seal, have facilitated environmentally

 2 Further evidence of the rise of green consumers abounds. Environmental awareness, after

 dipping in the mid-1980s, has again emerged as an issue globally and in America. A 1990 study
 by the Roper Organization found that from 1987 to 1990, public concern about the environment
 grew faster than concern about any other national problem. During this same period, the num-
 ber of green product introductions quintupled to nearly 10 percent of all new products (Thayer,
 1990), and the Sierra Club's membership rose an average of 13.9 percent annually (Sierra Club,
 1993). Finally, nearly a third of consumers have purchased a product specifically for its green
 labeling or advertising, and a quarter routinely read labels to gain an understanding of the
 environmental impacts of products (Roper Organization, 1990).

 informed buying behavior; these sources convey to consumers the informa-
 tion they need to make choices among products and firms. Intermediate
 purchasing behavior also reflects this trend: firms like McDonalds and Pru-
 dential Insurance are pressuring upstream companies to "get greener" (Ho-
 lusha, 1995).

 As a firm develops an environmental policy, it must also develop a
 reputation for that policy, since such a reputation is in itself a source of
 market advantages. We observe such reputation-profit links in the business
 world. Firms from ARCO to Procter & Gamble generally credit part of their
 profits to a reputation for pro-environment corporate behavior (Harrison,
 1993; Piasecki, 1995). An environmental reputation must be built on top of
 an overall reputation for quality. Once gained, a pro-environment reputation
 is itself a valuable inimitable resource. Haagen-Dazs cannot purchase Ben &
 Jerry's reputation, nor can it effectively replicate that reputation in the short
 term.

 One intangible asset that has received little previous attention in re-
 source-based theory development is an organization's political acumen,
 which we define as the ability to influence public policies in ways that
 confer a competitive advantage. This neglect of corporate political strategy
 may be a result of managers viewing it as outside of their primary respon-
 sibilities (Post, 1978). But savvy executives have firmly grasped the worth of
 political strategy as a strategic resource (Mahon, 1989). Political skills are an
 inimitable, valuable resource that can be used to neutralize, promote, or
 otherwise manage external constituencies.

 Managers following a compliance policy tend to employ legislative and
 political lobbying aimed at slowing down the pace of environmental legis-
 lation (Logsdon, 1985). This externally directed approach stands in contrast
 to the technical and organizational focus of a prevention policy. Prevention-
 oriented firms develop skills that help them adopt external technologies to
 meet the demands of society and even move to "raise the floor" in that regard
 (Starik & Rands, 1995: 923), but compliance-oriented firms develop political
 acumen to fend off these imperatives. Such a reactive focus with respect to
 other elements of firm strategy (e.g., product design or customer service)
 would clearly be seen as inferior.

 In summary, a resource-based analysis of the link between environmen-
 tal performance and economic performance leads directly to our first hy-
 pothesis:

 Hypothesis 1. High levels of environmental performance
 will be associated with enhanced profitability.

 The Moderating Effect of Industry Growth

 In this section, we discuss physical assets and technologies, human
 resources and organizational capabilities, and intangible resources in turn,
 arguing that industry context in general, and the growth within an industry
 in particular, moderate the influence of social performance on economic

 performance. As noted above, the majority of work in this area has stressed
 issues internal to firms. Here, we try to trace why firms are more likely to
 reap benefits from increased social performance when they are in high-
 growth industries rather than low-growth industries.

 Physical assets and technology. Movement toward the prevention mode
 of operation increases a firm's level of risk. Under normal conditions, an
 investment in redesigning and replacing existing processes in a competitive
 environment is financially significant and involves substantial risk. How-
 ever, the decision to adopt clean technologies and to incur the added costs
 of pollution reduction without governmental action is even more risky for
 two reasons. First, early in their life cycles, technologies and processes that
 are on the cutting edge of source reduction may cost more and be of lower
 quality than they will be when they become off-the-shelf technologies of the
 type described above (Groenewegen & Vergragt, 1991; Kemp, 1993). Second,
 the viability of new, clean technologies can be largely unknown, as are the
 economic consequences of their use (Kemp, 1993; Shrivastava, 1995a).

 Regardless of industry context, prevention entails risk, but we argue that
 for two reasons, industry growth influences how returns to this risk affect
 profitability. According to discounted cash flow analysis, the level of an
 industry's growth moderates the expected probabilities of return (Brealey &
 Myers, 1991), because the expected payoff of any investment risk is higher in
 high-growth industries. Another factor relates to the technology life cycle
 (Abernathy & Utterback, 1978). In general, industry growth accelerates the
 maturation of a technology, which rapidly reduces the levels of risk inherent
 in investing in a long-lived technology at its emergent point. Thus, firms that
 invest in a pollution prevention policy, although adding to risk, also have a
 higher prospective return in a high-growth industry. Firms that fail to invest
 in newer technologies would suffer comparatively. Likewise, a pollution
 prevention policy will face a lower prospective return in a low-growth or
 declining industry. Rapid turnover of technologies in high-growth industries
 may also promote the learning-based organizational spillovers that were
 described above.

 Organizational capabilities. Another major reason that we expected re-
 turns to environmental performance to be higher in high-growth industries
 involves organizational capabilities.3 To make this argument, we refer to the
 two primary environmental thrusts discussed above: compliance, the so-
 called end-of-pipe approach, and prevention, the system that stresses source
 reduction and process innovation (Hart, 1995). Although a bureaucratic

 3 We do not address the issue of human resources in this section (as we did in the analogous
 section on direct effects), as we feel that here most such arguments would be speculative. For
 example, one line of reasoning might run something like this: in high-growth industries, em-
 ployee growth is higher, and firms will be less likely to suffer from the organizational inertia
 that blocks pro-environmental change (Shrivastava, 1995a). Such conditions might also provide
 "a climate conducive to risk-taking and persistent problem solving" (Drumwright, 1992: 32),
 which promotes environmental improvement.

 management style may be matched to compliance, use of a more organic
 style is necessary to capture the gains associated with going beyond com-
 pliance, because the latter generates the type of innovative culture (Aiken &
 Hage, 1971) that enhances prevention efforts. The likelihood of an organic
 structure's being in place depends partly on industry growth.

 Low-growth industries are more likely to be populated by mature firms
 selling standardized products (Hofer, 1975). Under such conditions, organ-
 izational structures can be expected to be hierarchical, inflexible, and bu-
 reaucratic (Burns & Stalker, 1961). Within such organizations, then, adopt-
 ing policies and procedures associated with pollution prevention would be
 difficult, as they require a loosening of organizational structures and norms.
 Furthermore, such changes might well degrade performance if more mecha-
 nistic (Burns & Stalker, 1961) structures are associated with high perfor-
 mance in mature industries (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). For higher-growth
 industries, one would expect more organic structures to be in place, a situ-
 ation that would facilitate pollution prevention efforts. An organic structure
 may also allow a firm that has more unabsorbed slack (Singh, 1986) to invest
 in environmental improvements.

 Intangible resources. In this section, we discuss two intangible re-
 sources, reputation and political acumen. Both resources can work for or
 against a firm. With respect to reputation, we expect the connection between
 environmental performance and profitability to be stronger as industry
 growth rises. Assuming, as above, that consumers respond to reputations for
 environmental stewardship, the question is why such reputations are easier
 to construct in high-growth industries.

 Growing industries are much more likely to experience entry by new
 players, and they are subject to methods and rules of competition that are
 still in flux (Porter, 1980). Initial reputations are still being established. If it
 is true that "the cumulative investments that firms consistently make in
 different domains over a long period of time are more likely to influence the
 cognitive interpretations of stakeholders" (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 254),
 then it follows (1) that an initial reputation is partly a matter of firm choice
 (for instance, trying to be known for being green versus being known for
 customer service) and (2) that once established, a reputation is difficult to
 change. This latter point is important, as firms in older, more mature indus-
 tries tend to have preexisting reputations on numerous other dimensions.
 Shrum and Wuthnow (1988), for example, found that the performance-
 reputation association was tighter in photovoltaics, a growth industry, than
 in nuclear power, a mature industry. It is also true that when a firm is in an
 older, basic manufacturing industry, detriments to its reputation tend to
 affect consumer perceptions of the entire industry, as the Exxon Valdez
 disaster demonstrated (Jennings & Zandbergen, 1995; Koen, 1992). Such
 spillovers would tend to dampen the returns to positive environmental per-
 formance that occur in low-growth industries.

 A second intangible asset follows from an examination of political strat-
 egy. How would the development and use of political resources differ in

 high- and low-growth industries? High-growth industries tend to be younger
 industries. Yoffie (1988) argued strongly for use, in such a setting, of a
 political strategy that stresses establishment of an institutional framework
 amenable to all players. That is, in a young industry the focus tends to be on
 the industry as a whole, and not on capturing direct firm-specific advantages
 vis-'a-vis competitors.

 In lower-growth industries, the situation is more complex. Political ac-
 tion in such settings is more proactive (Raelin, 1984). Here, political strate-
 gies tend to center on so-called rent-seeking (Buchanan, Tollison, & Tullock,
 1980), the securing of competitive advantage via political means. Leone
 (1986) provided many examples of such tactics (generally, in accounts of
 mature industries), such as firms favoring pollution control regulation
 whose costs fell disproportionately on their competitors. Independent as-
 sessments of environmental performance, such as those developed by the
 Investor Responsibility Research Center (1995), often include expenditures
 for pollution control. In this case, a high-spending firm may appear to be
 more environmentally conscious, while actually impairing its cost position
 in its industry, and hence, its profitability.

 In our discussion of the contrasting political tendencies of compliance
 and prevention firms in the preceding section, we noted that a compliance
 policy stresses a political strategy for competitive advantage, but a preven-
 tion policy stresses technical and organizational solutions instead. In a high-
 growth environment, the political actions associated with a compliance
 strategy are out of step with the needs and prevailing attitude of the industry
 and should yield less success. Likewise, success in lower-growth environ-
 ments often demands reliance on the political strategies characteristic of a
 compliance policy.

 The preceding remarks suggest that the growth rate of an industry mod-
 erates the connection between environmental performance and profitability.
 Hence,

 Hypothesis 2. The level of an industry's growth will mod-
 erate the relationship between the environmental perfor-
 mance and profitability of firms in that industry; the
 greater the industry growth, the greater the positive im-
 pact of environmental performance on firm profitability.

 Sample, Methods, and Measures

 We began with the group of firms assigned environmental ratings by the

 firms spans all industrial classifications. We drew data on the firms for the
 years 1991 and 1992, using these years (1) because the first FRDC ratings

 were made in 1991 and were based on data from that year and previous
 years4 and (2) because two years seemed to us to represent an adequate
 period in which to test the influence of environmental performance, without
 letting too much time lapse between the measurement of the dependent and
 independent variables. The two-year period and lagging all independent
 variables that did not represent change scores by one year allowed us to test
 for causality.

 We drew a number of financial statistics from COMPUSTAT for each
 company. We removed utilities, whose returns are subject to statutory limits;
 70 observations per year were removed for this reason. Also removed were
 firms with missing data for one or more variables, predominantly the adver-
 tising, industry concentration, and firm sales growth variables. For 1991, 137
 firms were excluded because of such missing data, and for 1992 exclusions
 were roughly the same. We then deleted a small number of observations for
 firms that had either grown or shrunk by more than 50 percent in either of
 the two years (3 firms in 1991). We used this procedure because these firms
 may have experienced major sell-offs, restructurings, or acquisitions that
 would have made them a source of bias (firms that had themselves been
 acquired were not rated by the FRDC). The predictive power of the models
 increased greatly after we removed these firms, which suggests that includ-
 ing them would have introduced misspecification to our models. Finally, we
 removed firms for which data were available for 1991 but not 1992, or vice
 versa (24 firms in 1991). The final sample size was 243 firms.

 Environmental ratings were based directly on the scores given to the
 sample firms by the FRDC. These scores are based on a number of criteria,
 such as compliance records, expenditures, and other initiatives used to meet
 new demands, to reduce waste reduction, and to support environmental
 protection organizations. Thus, the ratings are well-matched to our theory,
 which explicitly highlights compliance and prevention efforts by firms. Not
 based on self-reports, the FRDC ratings correlate negatively and significantly
 with 1989 firm toxic releases per unit of sales (p < .01) and an index devel-
 oped by the Investor Responsibility Research Center (1995) to track fines and
 penalties in 1989 (p < .02). The 1989 figures were the most recent figures
 available during 1991, as there is a lag between the reporting of such infor-
 mation and its issuance by the federal government. The ratings are internally
 adjusted for industry conditions, and virtually all industries contain firms
 with high and low ratings (a more complete description of the FRDC rating
 system appears in the Appendix). As the FRDC ratings were not systemati-
 cally updated during this period, we held them constant for the two years.

 4 Unfortunately, unlike many social science phenomena, such as product recalls, hostile
 acquisition attempts, and job changes, for which the number of discrete events in a year can be
 counted, assessments such as the FRDC ratings are difficult to associate with an exact time
 frame. This follows from the consideration of data from previous years in the decision calculus
 in a later year. Thus, we felt that it was proper to include 1991 data in our analysis. However,
 separate results for 1991 and 1992 are provided in our tabulated results.

 We reverse-coded the FRDC scale to run from 1 to 5, so that high values
 reflect good environmental performance.

 Our dependent variable was a company's return on assets, or ROA, a
 generally accepted measure of firm performance. In choosing control vari-
 ables, we began with a list of the seven causal variables most prevalent in
 prior studies of performance (Capon, Farley, & Hoenig, 1990). These were
 industry concentration, firm growth rate, firm size, capital intensity, re-
 search and development intensity, advertising intensity, and market share.
 We dropped market share from consideration, because of a complete lack of
 data, and also dropped research and development, because many data were
 missing and the variable was consistently insignificant in trial regressions.
 We added industry growth rate, as our hypotheses cast this variable in a
 moderating role. Drawing on Capon and colleagues' (1990) findings, we
 expected the signs of these controls (including industry growth) to be posi-
 tive, except for firm size, which had no consistent effect in that study, and
 capital intensity, which weighed in negatively when measured at the firm
 level.

 We operationally defined the controls as follows: Industry concentra-
 tion was measured as the four-firm concentration ratio at the four-digit Stan-
 dard Industrial Classification (SIC) level and was taken from the 1987 Cen-
 sus of Manufactures (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992). Recently pub-
 lished reports now provide these data for nonmanufacturing firms for the
 first time (e.g., U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995). Firm growth rate was
 a firm's annual change in sales, expressed as a percentage. The natural loga-
 rithm of sales volume served as a proxy for firm size, and capital intensity
 was defined as the ratio of assets to sales. Industry growth was the average
 annual increase in sales for four years (1991 observations) or five years (1992
 observations); we could not go further back because of the revision of the
 Standard Industrial Classification system in 1987. For industry growth, we
 used the most consistent set of data we found, from the U.S. Bureau of the
 Census, which provided numbers at the three-digit SIC level. Because we
 pooled two years of data, we included a dummy variable set equal to 1 if an
 observation was from 1991 and to 0 otherwise. The purpose of this variable
 was to pick up fixed effects that varied between the two years. All variables
 except for the FRDC ratings changed between 1991 and 1992.

 As noted above, numerous firms had missing values for advertising
 intensity, so we undertook a special procedure to fill in these data (the
 figures provided above for missing data refer to conditions obtaining after
 the following procedure had been carried out). We began by measuring ad-
 vertising intensity as annual expenses for that function divided by firm size.
 For a small number of observations, size was not available, so we used
 annual industry averages printed in Advertising Age.

 To test Hypothesis 2, we used an interaction term formed by multiplying
 the FRDC environmental variable and industry growth. As is often the case,
 the interaction term was highly correlated with its constituents, a situation
 that can produce multicollinearity and unstable regression estimates. There-

 fore, we employed the procedure suggested by Aiken and West (1991) to
 confront this problem. The Aiken and West approach calls for "de-meaning"
 (or centering) the direct terms by subtracting the mean of each variable from
 the values for each observation. Coefficient estimates for equations without
 the interaction term are not changed. More importantly, as we show below,
 the interaction term created by the multiplication of the two de-meaned
 direct variables displays little correlation with those direct terms when it is
 inserted thereafter.5 We used ordinary least squares regression techniques.
 With only two years and 243 firms, we chose not to correct for autocorrela-
 tion under the assumption that our statistical approach should reflect our
 data, which look far more like a cross section than a time series.6

 RESULTS

 Descriptive statistics appear in Table 1. Correlations are generally low,
 with the exception of the relationship between the firm growth rate and
 ROA, and the industry growth and interaction terms, which are strong and
 positive. The last correlation provides initial support for Hypothesis 2. Of
 special note is the pattern of correlations between the interaction term and
 its constituent terms. Because we constructed the interaction term used in
 the correlations and regressions by multiplying the de-meaned industry
 growth and environmental ratings variables, correlations with those vari-
 ables are modest, and one correlation is negative. If we had used an inter-
 action term formed by simply multiplying together the industry growth and
 environmental ratings variables, their correlations with the interaction term
 would have been .95 and .28, respectively. Thus, our goal of constructing a
 meaningful test of direct and interactive effects by reducing multicollinear-
 ity was achieved.

 Table 2 shows regression results with 1991 and 1992 data pooled. Model
 1 includes the control variables. The coefficient on the firm growth rate is
 positive and highly significant, as is the coefficient on advertising intensity.
 Of the remaining control variables, capital intensity is significant and acts in
 the expected direction, firm size and the 1991 dummy variable are signifi-
 cant and positive, and the concentration ratio is insignificant. In this equa-
 tion, industry growth is significant and positive, demonstrating an effect
 separate from that of firm growth. Thus, of five control variables for which
 we had prior expectations, four were significant predictors of profitability
 and acted in the expected direction. This observation added to our confi-
 dence in the regression modeling, because it indicated that we were picking

 5 We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this procedure.
 e We also checked for the presence of heteroskedasticity in our estimation using an option

 available in the statistical package SHAZAM (White, Wong, Whister, & Haum, 1990). There is
 no single test for heteroskedasticity, and its presence could not be established. To double-check,
 we generated the regression equations again, employing White's (1980) correction for hetero-
 skedasticity. Results were very similar to those we present here.

 up the effects of previously established central tendencies in our models.
 Total explained variance is at or above levels obtained in other studies
 estimating return ratios and using control variables (e.g., Huselid, 1995;
 Ilinitch & Zeithaml, 1995; Tosi & Gomez-Mejia, 1994).

 Model 2 tests Hypothesis 1 by including a direct effect for the environ-
 mental performance variable. Its coefficient is positive and significant at the
 p < .004 level, providing solid support for Hypothesis 1. Although the in-
 crease in the equation's R2 is modest, it should be borne in mind that the
 equation already contains seven control variables. However, this increment
 in explained variance is highly significant, indicating that the impact of the
 environmental performance variable is not due to collinearity with other
 variables in the equation. Model 3 tests Hypothesis 2 by adding the interac-
 tion term to the regression equation. As with the addition of the environ-
 mental performance variable, the variance explained rises modestly, but
 significantly. The pattern of the coefficients on all the variables from the
 previous model changes little. Of particular importance is the fact that the

 coefficients on the environmental performance variable and industry growth
 variables shift very little in either value or significance level, showing that
 our strategy of de-meaning those variables produced the desired stability in
 regression estimation. The interaction term is significant and acts in the
 hypothesized direction. Thus, our results show that although the contribu-
 tion to the explained variance in firm performance made by our variables of
 interest is modest, higher environmental performance is associated with
 higher financial performance, and the relationship is strengthened as indus-
 try growth rises.

 To explore this effect further, we evaluated model 2 by taking the partial
 derivative of the regression equation with respect to the environmental per-
 formance variable, yielding the following:

 8(ROA)I8(environmental rating) = 1.59 + (0.51 x de-meaned industry growth).

 Setting this expression equal to 0 and solving for industry growth yields a
 value of -3.14 percent for de-meaned industry growth. That is, increasing
 environmental performance improved the bottom line in all cases where
 (de-meaned) industry growth was greater than -3.14 percent, which is true
 in virtually all of our data. Thus, our results indicate that "it pays to be
 green" as a rule, and that this relationship strengthens as industry growth
 increases. The industry context facing a firm is a key determinant of the
 effect of environmental performance on financial profitability, confirming
 Hypothesis 2.

 To examine the robustness of our results, we split our data by year and
 conducted analyses of 1991 (models 4, 5, and 6) and 1992 (models 7, 8, and
 9) separately. Results, shown in Table 3, provide support for our findings. In
 terms of our control variables, the value of the coefficients is quite consistent
 as we compare analogous models (for example, compare model 1 to models
 4 and 7). But there are some shifts in significance levels. The coefficient on
 the environmental performance variable drops just below generally accepted
 significance levels in 1991 (p .10 and .11 in models 5 and 6, respectively),
 perhaps because of the degrees of freedom lost by splitting the data. How-
 ever, this variable is significant in 1992, as shown in models 8 and 9. The
 interaction term is significant in both 1991 and 1992. In all cases, the sig-
 nificance levels of the increases in variance explained follow the signifi-
 cance levels of the coefficients on the variables added. Our general conclu-
 sion, therefore, is that support for our hypotheses is robust.

 CONCLUSION

 In this concluding section, we return to our motivation for this study,
 review our results, and take a step back to try to place them in perspective.
 At this point, we feel it necessary to reiterate that our variables of interest do
 not account for more than a modest level of variation in firm performance.
 For example, in models 2 and 3 respectively, the variation explained rises by
 roughly 1 percent of the total variance and 4 percent of the explained vari-

 ance. But given that a number of well-established control variables were
 entered into the equation, we consider the finding of relatively consistent
 patterns of significance and coefficients on our variables of interest of clear
 scholarly value. In the remarks that follow, we attempt to provide further
 insight on the issues raised, while staying within the bounds of what our
 data analysis yielded.

 Returns to Corporate Social Performance: Inching Closer to Resolution

 Wood and Jones (1995) attributed the inconsistent statistical findings on
 the relationship between corporate social performance and economic per-
 formance to "stakeholder mismatching," or comparing the economic out-
 come desired by one set of stakeholders (e.g., shareholders) to corporate
 actions desired by another set of stakeholders (e.g., environmental activists).
 For example, the fact that profit and corporate crime are positively correlated
 (Baucus & Near, 1991) might be due to the fact that such behavior often
 results in no traceable cost or consumer reaction.

 In many settings, this interstakeholder dichotomy is a sharp one, and it

 1997 Russo and Fouts 551

 generates equivocal findings with respect to how corporate social perfor-
 mance affects profits. However, we emphasize that the interests of distinct
 stakeholders are not orthogonal as a rule, or even necessarily aligned un-
 evenly. Indeed, the Economist has argued that society is entering "the era of
 corporate image, in which consumers will increasingly make purchases on
 the basis of a firm's whole role in society: how it treats employees, share-
 holders, and local neighborhoods" (1994: 71). Thus, to the extent that ac-
 tions by downstream users and consumers elicit desired corporate behavior,
 stakeholder interests may parallel one another. As a social issue, environ-
 mental concerns are somewhat unique in terms of how strongly they appear
 to be manifested in the marketplace. This occurs because environmental
 concern correlates strongly with income, and therefore with purchasing lev-
 els (Roper Organization, 1990). But it should be noted that since the relative
 influence of consumers is not democratic but is based on what they spend,
 marketplace outcomes will not always reflect social equity considerations.
 Factors internal to firms also result in environmental concerns being a
 unique social issue. Our theoretical development is in broad agreement with
 Post (1991) and Post and Altman (1992), who argued that environmental
 issues are more systemic than other social issues and affect a broader con-
 stellation of organizational functions. In fact, the recently developed ISO
 14000 international environmental management standards aim to institu-
 tionalize the idea of a systemic approach (Tibor & Feldman, 1996). Through-
 out our application of the resource-based view of the firm, this systemic
 dimension of environmentalism underlies our theory of how proactive poli-
 cies translate into internal competitive advantages. By way of contrast, a
 good example of a corporate social policy that lacks this systemic nature
 would be investment in South Africa, which would tend to be more sepa-
 rable from the core elements of a firm. This observation could help to explain
 Meznar, Nigh, and Kwok's (1994) finding that announcements of withdraw-
 als from South Africa resulted in losses in shareholder wealth.

 Taken as a whole, our study indicates that the resource-based view of
 the firm can be applied fruitfully to corporate social responsibility issues.
 This in turn suggests a greater breadth of application for resource-based
 theories. Our dependent variable in this case is economic performance, but
 our overall thrust is consistent with a theoretical framework that could pre-
 dict corporate social responsiveness or choice of political strategy. Hart
 (1995) used such an approach, positioning social legitimacy as a perfor-
 mance criterion when he applied resource-based theory to corporate envi-
 ronmental performance. To the extent that corporate social policies are sys-
 temic, this view may explain the type of social complexity underlying some
 forms of sustainable competitive advantage.

 The Moderating Influence of External Conditions on Corporate Strategy

 We found evidence that the connection between environmental perfor-
 mance and economic performance strengthens in higher-growth industries.
 Although the idea that outcomes of more traditional organizational initia-

 tives and strategies are partially contingent on external environments is
 well-established (Prescott, 1986), our study extends this notion to encom-
 pass environmental initiatives. The results also square with Collis and Mont-
 gomery's (1995) assertion that fitting internal resources to external demands
 is a critical strategic issue.

 If in the long run the external constraints on firms are not legal or
 regulatory, but physical (Hart, 1985), firms will need to be even more atten-
 tive to those demands. Prospering under such conditions will demand in-
 novative thinking. Perhaps one avenue open to managers is to use their
 capabilities and resources to push an industry through what Shrivastava
 (1995b) called "eco-renewal" and find ways to improve industry growth
 through environmental initiatives. Such a renewal would benefit a firm not
 only directly, but also indirectly, by changing the nature of the competition
 it faces in ways that enhance returns to its resource base.

 Our theory led us to believe that industry growth moderates the rela-
 tionship between corporate social policies and performance. Might other
 variables also influence this relationship? The answer almost certainly is
 yes. In studying the complexities of industrial change, Mitchell recognized
 the necessity "to treat some factors as independent in what we recognize is
 really a non-linear multi-equation system and probably a chaotic one at that"
 (1989: 227). We have made simplifying assumptions here, and subsequent
 research may identify other causal agents that act on our system of variables.

 Identifying Research Needs

 Although in our analysis, the benefits of improved corporate environ-
 mental behavior appear to outweigh its costs, the exact calculus of this
 comparison is by no means clear and demands further examination. One
 conspicuous research implication is that if superior environmental perfor-
 mance drives higher returns, researchers need to identify the full chain of
 variables connecting the end links. If, as we assert, company-initiated poli-
 cies play a role in improving economic performance, an important study
 could follow companies before and after important pro-environment
 changes, to gain insight on which policies yield the most acute bottom-line
 effects. Researchers are likely to find that better information on these poli-
 cies is needed. It would also be helpful to understand where returns to
 environmental performance end. That is, at some point, do resources be-
 come so focused on environmental issues that a firm shortchanges other key
 functions, such as customer service?

 Research that is explicitly longitudinal would also offer benefits. If one
 accepts the proposition that industries generally move from high growth to
 lower or even negative growth (Hofer, 1975), then with respect to environ-
 mental performance, a logical outcome of our study is that the resource
 endowment of a firm will have to change accordingly, because the resource
 base that yields rents in the early stage may be less productive thereafter. For
 example, the resources represented by political strategy will need to evolve
 with time. This process of developing new capabilities is fraught with dif-

 ficulty, and we agree with Barney (1986) that how firms recognize the need
 to change key resources over time and act upon these imperatives is a subject
 that deserves further development.

 Also poorly understood is the precise role of consumption behavior in
 the social performance-economic performance equation. Empirical analysis
 of the purchasing behavior of downstream users and consumers with respect
 to environmental product attributes is clearly warranted. One research proj-
 ect with great potential returns would be a panel study of downstream users
 and consumers that followed purchases across time and could track what
 influenced the change to and continued purchase of green products. It could
 also confirm how closely actions match attitudes.

 Managing for Environmental Quality and Economic Performance

 As noted above, a general danger with shaping a firm's resources for the
 long run is that industry transitions may render previously critical resources
 of marginal value. If, as Hart (1995) suggested, industrial society will evolve
 to the point where sustainable development is the norm, then technological,
 organizational, and human resources that serve a firm's environmental aims
 now should be even more valuable then. But protecting and enhancing the
 value of resources requires careful oversight and supportive actions. For
 example, a firm's pro-environment reputation demands continued invest-
 ment in consistency of action, so that the firm's advantage does not erode
 from within. As recent attacks on The Body Shop have shown (Entine, 1995),
 although there is considerable "unclaimed reputation 'space' with respect to
 corporate environmental performance" (Hart, 1995: 995), significant risks
 await firms that do not hold true to expressed principles.

 One keystone issue for corporations is how to treat existing environ-
 mental standards. There is evidence that many corporations regard pollution
 limits as minimums and try to exceed minimal compliance levels and po-
 sition themselves for future changes in policy (Business Week, 1990). This
 would appear to be a wise strategy, as increased popular interest in the
 environment may translate into a tightening of standards. In fact, in the
 specific context of environmental regulations, the idea of trying to burden
 competitors with greater regulatory mandates via the pursuit of regulation
 that is asymmetric across competitors (Leone, 1986) could actually backfire
 if consumers reward consistent excellence in this regard. Furthermore, the
 increasing availability of environmental information "implies that the lag-
 gards in environmental performance will more likely suffer at the hands of
 consumers, while those following an effective proactive approach will
 thrive" (Dean, Fowler, & Miller, 1995: 12).

 Another reason to go beyond compliance is that the organizational in-
 novation with which such a strategy is associated is well matched to the
 trend in environmental regulation itself. The pattern of regulatory legislation
 in America appears to be evolving from one of "command and control" to
 one that uses market-like mechanisms, such as offsets, "bubbles," and trad-
 able emissions permits, to achieve environmental gains (Hahn & Hester,

 1989). Such a trend will benefit firms that have promoted flexibility in their
 approach to environmental policy, because using market tools to improve
 the environment allows firms to tailor their responses to their own needs and
 to seek innovative solutions to meeting their responsibilities. More gener-
 ally, however, we believe that moving aggressively toward environmental
 improvement will help firms to become more entrepreneurial on a number
 of key dimensions that we have noted above.

 Cairncross labeled the rise of environmental concern "perhaps the big-
 gest opportunity for enterprise and invention the industrial world has ever
 seen" (1992: 177). We have not identified and measured every link in a
 complex causal chain, but our study suggests that shrewd managers have
 recognized this possibility and set to work assembling the organizational
 resources necessary to capitalize on this opportunity. Managers who instead
 resist and contest pressures for environmental improvement risk not only a
 profound loss of productive energy, but also a bottom-line loss of equal
 proportions.

 APPENDIX

 The Development of the Environmental Ratings Used in This Study

 The following are excerpts from the Franklin Research and Development Corporation's
 1989 publication, which provides a concise statement of what each rating indicates. The FRDC
 lists these four specific questions it asks when evaluating companies:

 Is the company in compliance with state and federal environmental regulations? Does it
 have major environmental lawsuits pending? Does it have a record of environmental contro-
 versy? Has it gone beyond the letter of the law in dealing with pollution problems?

 Where comparative environmental studies of an industry have been conducted, how has

 the company performed relative to others in its industry?

 What efforts has the company made in reducing the generation of hazardous wastes and in

 the proper disposal of those wastes it generates?

 Does the company contribute to, or otherwise support, nonprofit environmental protection

 organizations?

 We transformed the FRDC ratings to the following numbering system, under which high

 numbers mean better environmental performance.

 5: The company has taken exceptional initiatives in environmental matters with a reputa-
 tion for going beyond its peers in pollution control or hazardous waste reduction. The company
 has shown unusually strong support for environmental organizations.

 4: The company has demonstrated a strong concern in limited areas for the environment. It
 has no major environmental controversies pending. It has been moderately supportive of envi-
 ronmental organizations.

 3: The company has an environmental record that is mixed, distinguishes itself neither

 positively nor negatively on the environment, or is not in an industry with substantial envi-
 ronmental challenges.

 2: The company has an environmental record characterized by occasional major environ-

 mental controversy or litigation. It has fared poorly in environmental studies of its industry.

 1: The company has a consistent history of pollution control or other environmental prob-
 lems. The company is currently at the center of a major environmental controversy where the
 responsiveness of its actions are questionable. It has taken few or no steps to support environ-
 mental organizations.
