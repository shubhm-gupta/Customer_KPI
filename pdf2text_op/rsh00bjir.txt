Employees and High-PerformanceWork
Systems:Testing inside the Black Box
Harvie Ramsay, Dora Scholarios and Bill Harley

Abstract

Most work on high-performance work systems has examined only the direct
relationship between a set of management practices and performance outcomes.
This presumes that any connection operates through the incentive and moti-
vational effects captured as `high-commitment' or `high-involvement' employee
outcomes. No attempt has been made to examine the alternative, Labour
Process conceptualization, which expects performance gains from new man-
agement practices to arise instead from work intensification, offloading of
task controls, and increased job strain. Using data from WERS98, we tested
models based on high-performance work systems and labour process approaches.
Both were found wanting, and we consider the possible implications of these
failures.

This paper seeks to test the competing claims of theories advocating and
criticizing so-called `high-performance work systems' (HPWS) in order to
advance the debates about the nature and outcomes of emerging approaches
to labour management. In an attempt to fill gaps in past research, the
analysis explores linkages from HPWS practices to employee outcomes and
via these to organizational performance. The paper utilizes data from the
1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS98) to construct indi-
cators of HPWS practices, of employee outcomes and of organizational
performance as a means to explore associations between these phenomena.

The paper is divided into four main sections. In the first, an account is
provided of alternative theorizations of HPWS as a means to establish a
research agenda. The second section describes the features of the WERS98
data set and lays out the method used to operationalize HPWS and test
different models in this study. The third presents the results of the multi-
variate analysis used to test the models, and the concluding section considers
the implications of the findings.

1. Introduction: high-performance work systems

For the last decade or so, management scholars, especially in the Anglo-
phone countries, have been declaring the arrival of a new conceptual
approach to the ways in which certain employee management practices
impact positively on the `bottom line'. They have argued that effective
human resource policies offer organizations their best avenue for establish-
ing robust competitive advantages (e.g. Barney 1995). From this has
emerged the notion of a `high road' approach to management, in which
organizations choose to compete primarily on quality, and rely especially
on human resource development and employee contributions to succeed in
this.

Increasingly prominent in discussions of high-road approaches is the
concept of the high-performance work system, in which a range of inno-
vative human resource management (HRM) practices is used in certain
combinations or bundles which attain synergistic benefits through an inter-
active and mutually reinforcing impact (Huselid 1995). There are different
emphases in accounts of high-performance work systems, with some stress-
ing `high-involvement management' (HIM) and others `high-commitment
management' (HCM). More details of the specific HR practices associated
with HPWS and its variants are provided later in the paper, but briefly,
the strategy entails managements ceding a degree of control to employees
and introducing a range of progressive methods which increase employee
welfare. These include measures such as involvement programmes, team-
based work, enhanced training and development, forms of gain-sharing and
high-wage reward systems (Adler and Cole 1995; Appelbaum and Batt 1994;
Milkman 1997).

Two key issues emerge from existing studies of HPWS. The first concerns
the extent to which management practices work together as systems or
bundles. Huselid (1995) is emphatic about the systemic links between
practices. Although his factor analysis identified two dimensions among his
high-performance practices, one of which included employee skills and what
he called `organizational structures' and the other employee motivation, he
concluded from his subsequent analysis (Huselid and Becker 1996) that these
could safely be combined into a single measure. Numerous other studies
have explored the presence in some companies of an effective `bundle' of
HPWS practices (Arthur 1992; Kalleberg and Moody 1994; MacDuffie

1995; Ichniowski et al. 1997; Pil and MacDuffie 1996; Becker and Huselid
1998; Delaney and Huselid 1996; Becker et al. 1997).

One difference has been between those who have argued for a contingency
approach, in which the specific bundles would vary by sector and business
strategy (Arthur 1994; MacDuffie 1995; Youndt et al. 1996; Appelbaum et al.
2000), and the universalist, one-style-fits-all view, towards which Huselid
was drawn by his results. The latter view appears to have gained the ascend-
ancy, though with the modification that a combination of broad types of
practice in an overall `architecture' of policies provides room for different
detailed implementation in different settings (Becker and Huselid 1998: 87±91).
Wood and de Menezes (1998: 506), meanwhile, argued against the pack-
age view, instead treating `high-commitment management' as a matter of
degree.

The second key issue is that there is a consensus among those researchers
who have reported a link between HPWS and organizational performance
measures (see Huselid and Becker 1996; Cutcher-Gershenfeld 1991; Ichniowski,
Shaw and Prennushi 1997; Arthur 1994; Youndt et al. 1996; Appelbaum et al.
2000; MacDuffie 1995) that the associations reflect a causal link which flows
from practices through people to performance.1 Explanations of how and
why this link should work rely on theories of employee motivation in
response to the types of practice described by HPWS theory and have
become so embedded, especially in US management research, as to be taken
largely for granted. In brief, the implicit argument is that HPWS practices
may be taken at face value, as employee-centred and empowering. Em-
ployees, in turn, find that their needs are met by the opportunities and
benefits these practices provide, and respond by taking initiatives without
instruction and showing loyalty and enthusiasm for their employer.

These arguments have tended to focus on the efficacy of a range of
employee involvement initiatives,2 but the HPWS approach takes things
further by proposing a far wider portfolio of efficacious innovations.
Huselid summarizes the argument for the effect of these succinctly:

An increasing body of work contains the argument that the use of High
Performance Work Practices . . . can improve the knowledge, skills and abilities of a
firm's current and potential employees, increase their motivation, reduce shirking,
and enhance retention of quality employees while encouraging nonperformers to
leave the firm. (Huselid 1995: 635)

There is room for differences of emphasis within the literature on HPWS.
One focus is on `high-commitment management' (HCM) (affective and
normative rather than merely continuance commitment, in Allen and Meyer's
(1990: 1) terms), reducing turnover, absenteeism and costs through a re-
duction in the need for control and monitoring. Another stresses `high-
involvement management' (HIM) (see Lawler 1986), concentrating on the
enhanced opportunities for employees to take initiatives, arising from their
empowerment to take productive decisions. These are seen as intertwined
with trustworthy information flows, and are in turn dependent on training

investments to give employees the capability to contribute; the backing of
progressive procedures for such things as grievance handling or equal
opportunities, for instance; and performance incentives or stakeholding
innovations such as employee share ownership to lend a material edge to
their contributions.

It is this logic of interdependent effects that makes the HPWS argument
distinctive. It entails a causal path in which worker outcomes mediate
between HPWS practices and performance. Yet though these connections
are crucial to the argument, the linkages from HPWS to employee outcomes
and thence to organizational performance remain almost entirely untested.3
Most contributors have taken it as all but demonstrated that the impact on
worker experience and response must also have been positive, since this was
expected to be the route through which HPWS practices would have their
measured performance effect. That the changes are beneficial to employees
as well as employers is usually rather vaguely asserted Ð as in Huselid
again: `Presumably some of the value created by adopting more effective
HRM practices will accrue to employees' (1995: 667). Subsequently, Becker
et al. admit that the analysis of performance `does not provide direct
evidence of how such a system creates that value . . . there is very little
research that ``peels back the onion''. . .' (1997: 2).

An alternative view of the nature and outcomes of HPWS is informed by
what we term the `labour process' (LP) critique. There are numerous dif-
ferences of emphasis within the labour process tradition, and indeed what
constitutes `labour process theory' remains contested.4 None the less, we
characterize this alternative approach as LP because its basis is a recognition
that a fundamental and perennial problem for the management of labour in
capitalism is minimizing the potential gap between labour power and actual
labour as a means of maximizing profit (see Marx 1954: 486±96).

Our version of the LP approach shares with Braverman's (1974) version
of LP theory the recognition of a systemic trend in capitalism towards
the intensification of work; that is, managers are driven constantly to find
ways to make employees work longer and/or harder as a means to maxi-
mize labour input. Where we depart from Braverman's theory (1974) is his
argument that Taylorist de-skilling and direct forms of managerial control
are the key mechanisms of work intensification. Our theorization ap-
prehends alternative mechanisms. Informed by neo-Fordist theory (Palloix
1976; Aglietta 1979; Prechel 1994), our approach accepts that Taylorism
has limits and that there is, in contemporary work organization, some
move away from Taylorist strategies. Put simply, direct control and de-
skilling can be taken only so far before worker dissatisfaction and
employee±management conflict start
the
intensification process, and new ways of extracting effort have to be sought
(Clegg 1990: 211). The neo-Fordist LP critique conceptualizes HPWS
practices as an alternative approach to maximizing the contribution of
workers to production, which overcomes the limitation of Taylorist de-
skilling and direct control.

to outweigh the benefits of

Like the mainstream HPWS approach, this view sees the fundamental aim
of new management techniques as being to enhance workplace performance,
but it eschews the assumption that this will go hand in hand with positive
employee outcomes. In effect, the LP approach is concerned with the same
set of managerial practices as the HPWS approach. The key differences lie in
the anticipated employee outcomes of the practices.

In common with the HPWS account, the LP interpretation posits a
positive association between HPWS-style practices and employee discretion.
This association is conceptualized as an enhancement of discretion arising
from management's need to gain employee compliance and creative capability,
in search of which it offers `responsible autonomy' (Friedman 1977). These
changes, however, are likely to be offset by other costs, whose connection
may not be directly visible (Parker and Slaughter 1988). To the extent that
employees enjoy benefits, these will take the form of minor gains in dis-
cretion, granted as a means to gain compliance with managerial aims, which
are far outweighed by work intensification, insecurity and stress (see Harley
1995: 24±30).

The LP approach thus conceptualizes HPWS practices as leading, directly
or indirectly, to work intensification. The predicted outcome of this in
experiential terms would be that workers subjected to HPWS practices
would suffer higher stress levels than other workers. This stress would be
expected to arise directly from work practices, but also as a result of the
added responsibility associated with enhanced discretion, insecurity and
work intensification. Thus, we would expect to see both direct and mediated
effects between HPWS and stress.

To summarize the discussion so far, HPWS and LP approaches con-
ceptualize HPWS practices as likely to contribute to improved organiz-
ational performance. Moreover, they hold that HPWS practices have an
impact on employees and that it is, in large part at least, through this impact
that improvements in organizational performance are realized. It is at this
point that the two approaches part company. Conventional accounts of
HPWS argue that the practices associated with this approach enhance
employees' experience of work and that this feeds into improved organ-
izational performance. The HCM variant stresses the contribution of HPWS
practices to employee commitment as the key to performance, while the
HIM version of HPWS stresses the role of discretion. The LP critique holds
that, while HPWS practices may provide enhancements in discretion, these
come to employees at the expense of stress, work intensification and job
strain, the latter being a key explanatory factor in improved organizational
performance. The HCM, HIM and LP models of HPWS are presented in
diagrammatic form in Figure 1.

The aim of the remainder of this paper is to test these models using
the 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS98) as a means
of resolving differences between them. Our main focus is on employee
outcomes, both as important factors in themselves and as intermediate
variables in associations between HPWS and organizational performance.

Using WERS98

WERS98 provides data from both management and employees across small
and large organizations. The management questionnaire on HR practices
can be used as the basis for creating measures of HPWS-style practices
associated with different workplaces. The survey of employees sampled from

each establishment can then be matched to the equivalent workplace
management questionnaire.

The return rate from management respondents, at over 80 per cent,
compares favourably with most US studies which struggle with response
rates around or even below 25 per cent (Becker and Huselid 1998: 67).
WERS98 also focuses on the workplace level of analysis rather than the
company level,
thereby avoiding the problem of significant variation
between different plants of the same organization associated with company-
level studies (Becker and Gerhart 1996; Youndt et al. 1996).

One limitation, however, should be noted. While it is possible to relate
individuals to workplaces where particular management practices are
reported, it is not possible to know whether the actual respondents are
always among those experiencing particular practices in their workplaces.
This problem actually applies to most of the HPWS literature, which tends
to assume that all employees are treated in the same way in each organ-
ization. In the present analysis, we used employee-level data to represent
attitude measures and workplace-level data to represent the HPWS-style
practices and organizational performance outcomes. By including several
employee background variables in the multivariate analyses, we were able to
control partially for within-workplace variance in attitudes, but not for
variance in exposure to the practices.

High-performance Work System Variables

The set of HPWS management practices used as the common departure
point for the models presented in Figure 1 was based, as far as possible,
given the variables provided by WERS98, on the main contributions to the
field. There are differences in the composition of the set of practices com-
prising the HPWS used by authors (see MacDuffie 1995; Osterman 1994;
Youndt et al. 1996). Grievance handling or consultation, for example, may
be viewed as representing a traditional personnel management/industrial
relations approach to partnership, rather than an innovative one. Other
methods, such as equal opportunities policies, appraisals, harmonization,
some forms of management communication and structured selection
systems, could be viewed as bureaucratic and as representing firm-level
HRM policies rather than task-level employee-centred practices (MacDuffie
1995). Wood (1999a) examines family-friendly policies and finds them
unrelated to his measure of `high-commitment management', and there is
also some controversy concerning the role in the model of individual
performance incentives (Becker and Gerhart 1996; Wood 1999b: 394±5).
Some see these as part of a HPWS approach, while others feel they may be
divisive or diversionary by emphasizing material rewards. A distinction
is also hinted at by Huselid's (1995)
two dimensions Ð skills and
organizational structures (e.g. grievance procedures, use of selection tests,
incentive plans) and employee motivation (e.g. performance measurement,
appraisals).

508 British Journal of Industrial Relations

Our approach to developing a measure of HPWS practice was first to
identify an inclusive set of 24 HRM practices that HPWS literature (e.g.
Appelbaum et al. 2000; Huselid 1995; MacDuffie 1995; Wood and Albanese
1995) has linked to increased employee involvement and development. The
24 HPWS practice variables and the WERS98 management questionnaire
items used to construct them are described in the Appendix to this paper.
Each HPWS variable was a scaled composite of multiple items which were
either dichotomous responses indicating the existence of a practice, man-
agement reports of the proportion of non-managerial employees covered by
the practice, or management attitudes towards the practice's effectiveness.
Acknowledging the debates referred to above, we then identified a
possible subset of practices closest to the HPWS idea of enhancing employee
involvement and development, and which, as far as could be determined, are
also extended to non-managerial employees.5 This subset included practices
that enhanced involvement in problem-solving and decision-making through
work and job design (i.e. upward rather than downward communication,
employee consultation, problem-solving groups, team autonomy, involving
employees in quality management, job control); practices targeting employ-
ee motivation through incentive schemes (profit-related pay, employee share
ownership, performance-related pay); and practices aimed at the develop-
ment of employee skills (e.g. attention to induction procedures, Investor in
People accreditation, provision of job security and the existence of an
internal labour market).

This selection is dependent to some extent on the way in which we chose
to construct the HPWS variables from the WERS98 items. The Appendix
indicates that the items for formal teams and formal training, for example,
emphasize the existence of formal systems more than the degree of employee
involvement; therefore, we were less inclined to include these practices
among the HPWS-style practices. It is also possible, though, that some
organizational systems, such as formal training, team structures, appraisal
systems or management information, are effective support mechanisms for
the more innovative work organization, incentive-based and developmental
practices (e.g. Osterman 1994). An exploratory factor analysis of the 24
HPWS variables supported the notion of two distinct groups of practices
associated with organizational systems. These `systems' practices loaded on
the first two principal components in the factor analysis, leaving a further
seven factors.6

Drawing from the factor analysis, we retained the conceptual distinction
between two different types of `systems' practice and a third set of practices
in the construction of HPWS scores for each workplace.7 This allowed an
examination of the separate effects of these different subsets of practices in
the HCM, HIM and LP models. Three HPWS scores were computed from
the variables defined in the first part of the Appendix. The first score Ð
`Systems' Work Practices 1 (SWP1) Ð represented the practices that loaded
high on the first factor identified in the principal components analysis
reported above, and was computed as the sum of the standardized scores for

Employees and High-Performance Work Systems

509

workplaces on five variables: employee/union representation, consultation
committees, EEO/diversity management, family-friendly policies and sophis-
ticated recruitment/selection (Cronbach alpha=0.65). A second `systems'
score Ð `Systems' Work Practices 2 (SWP2) Ð was computed in the same
way using the practices that loaded high on the second factor: grievance
procedures, formal teams, harmonization, appraisals, formal training and
downward communication (Cronbach alpha=0.60). Finally, the third score
represented the practices expected to more closely resemble the `high-
performance' approach and so is labelled here the High Performance Work
Practices (HPWP) score. This was computed using the variables loading on
the weaker factors Ð profit-related pay, employee share ownership,
employee consultation, TQM, problem-solving groups, team autonomy,
job control, Investor in People accreditation, upward communication, job
security, internal labour market and induction procedures.8 The Cronbach
alpha reliability coefficient for the HPWP score was relatively low (alpha=
0.54); however, this is not surprising given the HPWS literature's lack of
coherence in defining what is essentially a complex, multi-component
management approach.9

Workplace Outcome Variables

The outcome variables used in the test of the HCM, HIM and LP models
were workplace performance measures drawn from the WERS98 manage-
ment questionnaire (see Appendix). This asked management to rate the
performance of their workplace in comparison with other workplaces in the
industry for financial performance,
labour productivity and quality of
product service, as well as asking how far labour productivity and labour
costs had gone up or down, and the percentage rates of absence and labour
turnover. These self-assessments must be regarded with some caution, but,
in the absence of actual workplace performance figures, they provide the
best available basis for analysis of workplace and behavioural-level out-
comes.

Intermediate Variables

Commitment,
job discretion and job strain were the key hypothesized
employee attitude predictors of workplace performance examined in the
HCM, HIM and LP models, respectively. These variables were constructed
as composites based on the sum of the standardized scores of items derived
from the employee attitude questionnaire (see Appendix for composite
descriptions and reliabilities). The commitment composite variable was
formed from three items corresponding to the concepts of affective and
normative commitment (Allen and Meyer 1990) and the job discretion
composite from three items capturing degree of influence in the job. Job
strain was measured as a two-item composite drawing on Karasek's (1979)
argument that strain arises not just from pressure per se (e.g. the perception

of working hard), but from job demands for which the requisite discretion is
not provided. One of the items used in the job strain composite, therefore,
was the perception of not having enough time to get the job done, the other
being how much employees worried about their work outside of their
working hours.

A further four variables were included as possible mediators of the
relationship between HPWS practices and commitment/job strain following
the predictions of the three models: three were employee perceptions of
management relations (support and fairness), extrinsic satisfaction (satisfac-
tion with pay) and job security. The fourth was a workplace variable, work
intensification, measured as management reports of change in workplace
labour productivity (see the Appendix for full descriptions).

Analytical Strategy

Linkages between the HPWS scores, the intermediate variables and work-
place performance, as specified in the HCM, HIM and LP models, were
examined in three stages using a series of regression analyses. The first stage
examined the effects of the three HPWS scores (`Systems' Work Practices 1
(SWP1), `Systems' Work Practices 2 (SWP2) and `High Performance' Work
Practices (HPWP)) on each of the workplace performance variables Ð
labour productivity, financial performance, product/service quality, absence
rate, turnover rate and the reduction in labour costs. These regressions used
workplace data from the management survey data set and controlled for
workplace size, age, foreign ownership, union density and sector.

The second set of regressions examined the effects of the three HPWS
scores on the employee outcomes hypothesized to mediate the relationship
between practice and workplace performance in each model. Each of the
employee attitude variables depicted in Figure 1 was regressed on the three
HPWS scores. These regressions were based on a data set created by
matching employee attitude data from the employee survey to correspond-
ing workplace HPWS scores calculated from the management survey. Thus,
in addition to attitude scores, each employee observation was assigned the
HPWS scores representing that employee's workplace. As well as control-
ling for workplace characteristics, this analysis controlled for employee's
sex, age, hours worked, employment contract, union membership, manage-
ment/professional occupation and income.

The final stage of the analysis examined the effects through which the
HPWS scores are hypothesized to affect workplace performance according
to the HCM, HIM and LP models. The first set of regressions in this
analysis examined the process through which HPWS practices result in
commitment and job strain. The HCM model hypothesizes that practices
will influence commitment primarily through enhancing employee control
and perceptions (here measured through discretion and perceptions of good
management relations) rather than extrinsic reward (satisfaction with pay).
The LP model predicts that practices will lead to negative rather than

Employees and High-Performance Work Systems

511

positive employee outcomes. In this analysis, perceptions of job insecurity
and discretion (interpreted by the LP model as a source of added
responsibility, hence pressure) were the primary experiences hypothesized
to mediate the effects of practices on strain. In addition, management-
reported work intensification (measured as change in labour productivity)
was also added as a potential explanatory variable for negative experiences.
Thus, for the HCM and LP models, the first step in the intermediate analysis
conducted regressions using commitment and job strain as dependent
variables. The matched employee±workplace data set described above was
used again here, so that commitment and job strain were measured at the
employee level. Mediation effects were shown if the influence of HPWS
practices on commitment or strain was altered when the hypothesized
intermediate variables were added to the equations.10

The second step in the intermediate analysis conducted regressions using
workplace performance as the dependent variable and examined the extent
to which the effects of HPWS practices could be explained by positive or
negative employee experiences. The HCM and HIM models predict that,
through cultivating employee commitment and/or job discretion, rather
than merely providing extrinsic rewards (pay), HPWS practices will not only
affect behavioural outcomes (low absenteeism and turnover) but also
translate into positive organizational outcomes (high labour productivity,
financial performance, product/service quality). The LP model predicts that
any positive effect of HPWS practices on these performance indicators is
generated at the cost of higher employee strain, greater insecurity and actual
work intensification, and that this will also be reflected in more negative
behavioural outcomes (high absenteeism and turnover). In addition, the
HPWS practices are expected to lead to a reduction in labour costs,
reflecting the `low-road' emphasis in LP interpretations. In each model, the
mediation effects were tested by examining the effects of adding each one of
the predicted intermediate variables incrementally to the regression model
containing the HPWS practices.

3. Results

The High-Commitment Model (HCM) and the High-Involvement Model
(HIM)

(a) Effect of HPWS scores on workplace performance
The regressions for workplace performance reported in Table 1 indicate
that, of the three HPWS scores, HPWP has the most consistent positive
effect on workplace performance. The HPWP score was positively related to
management reports of greater comparative labour productivity, financial
performance and product service quality, and lead to a decrease in turn-
over rate. The other behaviour-related outcome that is the focus of HCM
and HIM, the absence rate, was unrelated to the HPWS scores. Also, the

`systems' scores were either unrelated to performance or had a negative
effect. SWP2, for example, was significantly related to an increase in turn-
over (b=0.096) and reduced quality (b=70.078). Thus, only the practices
represented by our HPWP score appeared to conform with the expected
increases in workplace performance predicted by HPWS theory.

(b) Effect of HPWS scores on positive employee experiences
The first four columns of Table 2 show the regression equations for the
employee attitudes that the HCM and HIM expect to result from HPWS
practices, i.e. job discretion, management relations, pay satisfaction and
commitment. In each equation, the HPWP score had a positive and
statistically significant effect, supporting predictions that HPWS practices
are related to positive employee experiences. The two `systems' scores,
however, provide contradictory evidence. SWP1, in contrast to the effects of
the HPWP score, had a negative, statistically significant relationship with
job discretion, management relations and commitment, while SWP2 had
little effect except for a positive relationship with management relations.

These regressions show the effect of all three HPWS scores on positive
attitudes when entered together in the prediction equation. We cannot
conclude from these whether the effect of SWP2 is being cancelled out by
SWP1 or HPWP. We therefore repeated the analysis, this time adding each
HPWS score incrementally to the equation (i.e., first SWP1, then SWP2,
then HPWP) and comparing the explained variance (R 2) at each stage.
F-tests for the change in R2 showed that only in the case of management
relations were the `systems' scores having an independent and, as shown in
Table 2, different effect. In other words, for job discretion, pay satisfac-
tion and commitment, the addition of SWP2 in the equation did not sig-
nificantly increase the variance already explained by SWP1. Both `Systems'
Work Practice scores, therefore, had a generally negative or zero effect on
employee experiences.

(c) Intermediate effects
Equations (1)±(4) in Table 3 test for the mediation effects between the
HPWS scores and employee commitment as predicted by the HCM. These
indicate the effect on the HPWS scores of adding first job discretion, then
management relations, then extrinsic satisfaction,
incrementally, to the
model for commitment. Only the HPWP score had a direct positive effect on
commitment in equation (1) and, although the addition of job discretion in
equation (2) decreased this effect marginally, discretion could not account
entirely for the effect of the HPWP score on commitment. This finding
contradicts the HCM model's expectation that the effect of HPWS on
commitment functions primarily through increased perceptions of control.
The addition of management relations and satisfaction with pay to
equations (3) and (4), respectively, removed the significant relationship of
HPWP score to commitment, thus suggesting that the effects of HPWS
practices on commitment occur primarily by way of good management

relations (b=0.535) and to a lesser extent satisfaction with pay (b=0.129).
This is partially consistent then with the HCM model which predicts that
perceptions of management support and fairness may be one vehicle through
which HPWS practices enhance commitment.

In the analysis for the mediators of the relationship between HPWS
practices and workplace performance, we decided to focus only on the
HPWP score as an approximation of HPWS, since this measure appeared to
have the greatest effect on employee outcomes. The predictions of the HCM
and HIM were tested by comparing the results of two sets of equations: first,
regressions of the performance indicators on the HPWP score only, and
second, regressions of the performance indicators on the HPWP score and
the hypothesized intermediate variables. Examination of the decrement in
the HPWP score coefficient from the first to the second equation, as well as
the F-test for the gain in R2, indicated the extent to which the relationship
between HPWP score and workplace performance was mediated by the
HCM/HIM-predicted employee experiences.

Examination of the first step for each equation in Table 4 shows that
HPWP was positively related to comparative labour productivity, financial
performance and quality, and negatively related to turnover and absentee-
ism, consistent with HCM and HIM predictions. The direct effect of HPWP
on performance was reduced, but still statistically significant, when dis-
cretion, commitment, management relations and satisfaction with pay were
added to each of the equations. High employee commitment did explain
some of the relationship between HPWP score and high labour productivity,
financial performance and quality, although the effect, as measured by the
decrement in the HPWP score coefficient (0.008, 0.005 and 0.005 for each
dependent variable, respectively), was notably small. The extent to which
positive employee attitudes also explained the effects of HPWP score on
behavioural performance outcomes was either similarly small Ð as in the
0.005 decrement in the HPWP score coefficient for turnover Ð or non-
existent Ð as in its lack of significance in the equation for absence rate.
Thus, although the tests for addition to incremental variance were sig-
nificant, the size of the effect on HPWP score suggested that commitment
was not a strong mediator of the relationship of HPWS practices with
workplace performance. Nor was the HIM expectation that discretion
should have the greatest chance of affecting productivity and quality directly
supported by these results.

The Labour Process (LP) Model

(a) Effect of HPWS scores on workplace performance
As with the HCM and HIM, the LP model also predicts that HPWS
practices will be positively related to workplace performance indicators such
as labour productivity, financial performance and product/service quality.
Its emphasis, however, is on indicators that imply greater intensification of
work processes. In the present analysis, direct support for the LP model was

provided by the regression of management reports of increased labour
productivity (our measure for work intensification) on HPWS scores (see
Table 1). The strong positive coefficient for the HPWP score in this
regression (b=0.153) suggests that, in workplaces where these practices tend
to be used, management does perceive increased labour productivity.
However, the greater use of HPWPs does not appear to involve greater
reductions in labour costs that would be consistent with the `low road' LP
model predictions. In fact, only SWP2 appeared to have LP-consistent or
simply negative effects on workplace performance, with a strong relation-
ship to reduced labour costs (b=0.240), an increase in turnover (b=0.096)
and reduced quality (b=70.078).

(b) Effect of HPWS scores on negative employee experiences
The equations regressing employee outcomes on the three HPWS scores (see
Table 2) also partially support LP predictions. SWP1 had a generally negative
relationship with employee experiences, as is shown by the lower perceived
job discretion (b=70.030), poorer management relations (b=70.049),
lower pay satisfaction (b=70.012), lower commitment (b=70.020), and
less job security (b=70.040). SWP2, however, showed more mixed be-
haviour: it was positively related to perceived management relations but
negatively related to perceived security. This suggests that SPW2 may
contain a mix of practices that are both bureaucratic and more motivational
in their effects on employee experiences.

The HPWP score was positively related to job strain (b=0.046),
providing further support for the LP model. However, while both the
`systems' scores lowered perceptions of job security, the HPWP score
appeared to improve it. Further analysis (not shown here) found the HPWP
score on its own to have no effect on security (b=70.004); but the
introduction of the `systems' scores boosted its effect in a positive direction.
This has potentially interesting implications for examining the interactive
effects of the different subset scores on employee experience, with the
suggestion that
the presence of certain firm-level HRM policies and
structures may be generally supportive or facilitative of the effects of other
HPWS practices (e.g. Osterman 1994).

(c) The intermediate effects
The regressions testing for the effects of intermediate variables between
HPWS scores and job strain (equations (5)±(8) in Table 3) supported LP
predictions that HPWS practices would lead to job strain directly; however,
this effect was not mediated by the negative employee work experiences
included in this version of the model. The addition of job discretion to the
HPWS scores as predictors in equation (6), and of perceived security in
equation (7), did not lessen the effect of HPWP score on job strain, even
though both these potential mediators were positively related to the HPWP
score (see Table 2) and negatively related to job strain. In other words, the

adverse effects of the HPWS practices in terms of strain were not reduced by
any other potential positive outcomes.

Also evident from Table 3 is the finding that the effect of adding job
discretion was to reduce strain (b=70.028), contrary to neo-Fordist pre-
dictions. The effect of job discretion on strain, however, disappeared with
the introduction of perceptions of insecurity in equation (7), and, in turn,
the effect of insecurity remained constant when work intensification was
added in equation (8). Thus, while the results supported the LP model's
prediction that HPWS practices will have a direct effect on job strain, they
did not support the expectation that this effect would be derived from the
greater discretion afforded by the practices, or from the greater insecurity
resulting from either the practices or work intensification.

The final set of regressions (reported in Table 5) tested for the mediators
between HPWS practices (again using only the HPWP score) and workplace
performance predicted by the LP model. This was achieved in three steps:
first, by running the regression equations for workplace performance with
HPWP score only; second, by adding the employee variables to the equation
with HPWP score; and third, by adding the management-reported work
intensification variable. The addition of discretion, job strain and perceived
security into the equations (step 2 in Table 5) led to zero or very small
reductions in the coefficient for HPWP score, suggesting that, even though
these variables added significantly to the explained variance for all the
performance indicators, they did not mediate the relationship between
HPWP score and the dependent variables. Greater employee security, in
particular, was positively related to labour productivity, financial perfor-
mance and quality, and negatively related to turnover rate, but this cannot
be used to explain the effects of the HPWP score on performance.

Given that the HPWP score was found to influence perceptions of
security positively (see Table 2), the positive relationships found between
security and the performance indicators in Table 5 are only suggestive of
a `high road', rather than a labour process `low road', interpretation. In
support of LP predictions, though, the HPWP score was positively related
to reductions in labour costs and to higher levels of job insecurity, although
job security accounted for only a 0.001 decline in the coefficient for HPWP.
With regard to the effects of job strain, only in the case of labour prod-
uctivity and absence rate were the LP model's predicted relationships with
performance confirmed (b=70.023 and b=0.028, respectively). Again,
however, job strain could not be provided as an explanation for the effects
of HPWP on performance.

The addition of our measure of work intensification at step 3 accounted
for large decrements in the coefficients for HPWP score at steps 1 and 2.
This suggested that the HPWP score practices were indeed affecting
performance through work intensification. As suggested above, though, the
LP prediction that this effect resulted from negative employee experiences
was not supported. Interestingly, the addition of the work intensification
measure did result in a reduction of the coefficients for job security from

step 2 Ð most obviously for labour productivity, financial performance and
quality Ð thus perhaps interfering with some of the positive effects on the
performance of increased employee security. Once more, however, this
analysis could not confirm any direct links between workplace performance,
HPWP score and the degradation of employee experience.

4. Conclusions

The analysis presented above provides little support for HPWS or LP
theory, with all three of the models tested being called into question. Our
results confirm the relationship between HPWS-style practices and a
number of measures of workplace performance. However, the widely held
assumption that positive performance outcomes from HPWS flow via
positive employee outcomes has been shown to be highly questionable. This
most significant finding calls into question the unitarist assumption, which
underlies much mainstream management theory, that everyone benefits
from managerial innovation. Our results suggest that the HPWS orthodoxy
has been accepted far too uncritically by many scholars. Moreover, the
findings reported here caution against theorizations of work organization
that give primacy to employee orientations to work as an explanatory vari-
able for organizational performance and which are so common in main-
stream managerial literature.

The LP model, however, emerges from our analysis looking no more
robust than either of the HPWS models. While we do not step back from
our criticism of the orthodox assumption that management and labour are
both winners in the new world of work, nor do our results suggest that
we should accept the simple counter-argument that gains to management
always come at the expense for labour of degradation of work. On the basis
of the analysis presented here, this assumption is no more tenable than that
of orthodox theories of HPWS.

How can we explain the fact that none of the three models provides an
adequate account of the outcomes of HPWS? First, limitations inherent in
the WERS98 data might be responsible. It is possible that the indicators of
employee outcomes that we were able to generate using the WERS98 data
were not adequate to capture the factors that operate to generate positive
organizational performance. Moreover, even if the variables covered the
appropriate range of factors, they may have been unable to capture, in a

practices, employee response and organizational outcome used in the
analysis are perhaps too simplistic to capture the complex reality of the
implementation and operation of HPWS. It may also be the case that any
technique can be applied by organizations in different ways, more varied
than merely `high' or `low'-road, but seeming to vindicate either in different
selected cases. Over a large sample, these different ways of enacting methods

might well cancel each other out, with the result that there is no discernible
trend at the aggregate level.

We are reluctant to accept that the lack of support for the models can be
explained simply by problems with the data and statistical models. The
WERS98 represents the largest, most reliable and most current source of
data available on employee relations in Britain, and the items on employee
outcomes are for the most part well-established measures which have been
tested previously. Indeed, many of the measures that we have utilized are
similar or identical to those used in other studies of HPWS (e.g. Appelbaum
et al. 2000). Moreover, the statistical models employed are entirely appro-
priate to the data and to the research problems under investigation.

Perhaps, then, the results can be explained by limitations inherent in the
theorizations of HPWS that underlie the analysis. It is quite plausible that
outcomes flowing from managerial innovation are much less determinate
than our models apprehend. Many managements may simply be incompe-
tent (rather than either brilliantly constructive or conspiratorially exploita-
tive) at implementing and maintaining innovative approaches, with the
result that the putative outcomes of HPWS practices fail to eventuate. More
charitably,
it may be that there are major limitations to the strategic
management of labour which severely constrain the potential for innovative
approaches to be implemented successfully (see Hyman 1987). If either view
is correct, then we should not be surprised to see reality failing to be
captured by the models tested here.

Finally, the indeterminacy of labour, with its capacity to resist, passively
or actively, most managerial practices is a theme emphasized in recent LP
theory (Smith and Thompson 1998). If we accept a role for labour in shaping
outcomes, then we must expect an unevenness of outcome disruptive for
hypotheses based on simplistic managerial or labour process accounts.

elected/invited/volunteered, and whether the committees are rated by
management as being `very influential' on management decisions affecting
the work-force.

union or other employee representation, this variable was measured as a
summed score of two variables, each scored 1: whether there was consul-
tation or negotiation on all of nine issues (pay and conditions, recruitment
and selection, training, payment systems, handling of grievances, staffing or

Notes

1. Reverse causation, e.g. by performance making `headroom' for certain kinds of
people management practice, is either dismissed or rejected due to time-series
data (e.g. Huselid 1995).

putative outcomes for employees and organizations.

3. Two exceptions should be noted. Studies by Appelbaum and others (see Appel-
baum et al. 2000) have sought to measure worker responses, and indeed to include
potential negative outcomes in a pathbreaking study in three types of industry.
Patterson et al. (1997) examine the relationship of employee satisfaction and
commitment and company productivity and profitability, as well as that between
human resource management practices and these performance measures. They
show positive correlations in each case Ð but do not examine the full model by
exploring links from practices to employee responses.

4. See Ramsay (1985) for a clarification of competing labour process views, and
Smith and Thompson (1998) for an account of recent developments. A challenge
to conventional labour process theory has been provided by recent Foucauldian
elaborations which explore the ways in which managements seek to harness
work-group self-surveillance to enhance their control behind the appearance of a
measure of group autonomy (Sewell 1998); however, addressing the Foucauldian
approach is beyond the scope of this paper.

5. See Wood (1999b: 401±2) on the importance of the high-commitment concept

being extended to non-managerial employees.

6. Nine factors with eigenvalues more than or approximately equal to one and
explaining 58 per cent of the common variance were extracted through varimax
rotation. The first factor, accounting for 17.5 per cent of variance, could be
interpreted as firm-level personnel systems and structures, and included
employee/union representation, consultative committees, EEO/diversity man-
agement, family-friendly policies and sophisticated recruitment/selection. The
second factor, accounting for 8 per cent of variance, also included the variables
we had expected to find associated with HR systems Ð grievance procedures,
downward communication, existence of formal teams, formal training and
appraisal systems. The second factor could be interpreted as organizational
systems that provide support for involvement in decision-making and develop-
ment of skills in line with HPWS. The first factor composite score was more
likely to be higher in public-sector workplaces (r=0.20, p50.001) than the
second factor composite score (r=0.09, p50.001), which also supports the idea
that the first factor represents more traditional, possibly bureaucratic, systems
than the second. We interpreted the remaining factors as consisting of practices
closer to the desired conceptualization of a HPWS.

7. We also performed a series of cluster analyses on the full set of 24 practices,
consistent with MacDuffie's (1995) recommendation for empirical validation of
bundles, but no identifiable patterns were found. The cluster analysis method
estimated initial cluster centroids from a hierarchical procedure and then refined
the final solution using a non-hierarchical procedure that is less susceptible to
outliers (Hair et al. 1992: 278±9). Alternative solutions using the within-groups
linkage and Ward's method were found to be comparable.

8. Given performance-related pay's loading on the weakest ninth factor in the
factor analysis reported above, along with the conceptual ambiguity surrounding
its inclusion in HPWS (e.g. Becker and Gerhart 1996), this variable was dropped
from the analysis.

9. Also, homogeneity in multi-dimensional scales, particularly for complex
constructs, is best achieved when each component is measured by one sub-
scale (Spector 1992). Our approach to constructing the composite variables
representing HPWS from the available WERS98 data clearly was not consistent
with this criterion.

10. In all analyses testing the LP model where this measure of work intensification
was introduced, we also controlled for new technology innovation, which might
have been the one factor other than labour to raise productivity, perhaps with
less problematical consequences for employees.
