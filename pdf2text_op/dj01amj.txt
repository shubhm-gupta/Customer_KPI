 TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION

 AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: THE ROLE OF

 STRUCTURAL CONTROL AND EXPLORATION

 We explored the relationship between the degree to which total quality management
 (TQM) practices were adopted within organizations and the corresponding competi-
 tive advantages achieved. We found relatively strong support for this relationship. In
 addition, our data showed some support for the moderating influence of organizational
 structure on TQM implementation effectiveness. Specifically, two measures of organi-
 zational structure, labeled "control" and "exploration," were found to offer indepen-
 dent and interdependent influences on the financial performance of firms implement-
 ing TQM programs.

 Much has been written about total quality man-
 agement (TQM) practices and the many benefits
 that these practices bring to the organization that
 successfully adopts them. Notably, a considerable
 number of organizations have tried to implement
 these practices and have failed to achieve much, if
 any, competitive advantage, while many other or-
 ganizations have implemented TQM with great
 success. Some observers have argued that the prob-
 lem lies either with the failure to fully implement
 all of the key TQM practices (Hackman & Wage-
 man, 1995) or with the absence of complementary
 assets that must be combined with TQM to achieve
 competitive advantage (Carmen et al., 1996; Wald-
 man & Gopalakrishnan, 1996).

 Exacerbating this problem is the situation whereby
 "research is not providing the corrective function for
 TQM that it could and should" (Hackman & Wage-
 man, 1995: 339). For instance, a reason given for the
 lack of conclusive evidence in the literature lies in the
 treatment of TQM as a "discrete phenomenon" (West-
 phal, Gulati, & Shortell, 1997). In fact, Hackman and
 Wageman found that only 4 percent of the 99 articles
 published between 1989 and 1993 on TQM "assessed
 the degree to which TQM interventions actually were
 in place" (1995: 321). Given the complexity and per-
 vasiveness of implementing TQM in an organization
 (Westphal et al., 1997), it is important to assess the
 degree to which TQM practices have been imple-

 mented when evaluating TQM's relationship with
 competitive advantage.

 In addition, it has been argued that for an organi-
 zation to realize the value of a TQM implementation,
 it must have an internal organizational structure that
 is capable of frilly supporting the implementation
 (Waldman & Gopalakrishnan, 1996). According to
 Shea and Howell (1998), the preferred structure for
 organizations that implement TQM balances the need
 for control of activities with the flexibility needed to
 respond and adapt quickly to the changing market-
 place. It is thus important to assess organizational
 structure when evaluating an organization's TQM im-
 plementation. The purpose of this study was to ex-
 amine the degree to which a comprehensive set of
 TQM practices was implemented in a set of organi-
 zations, the effect of organizational structure on im-
 plementation effectiveness, and the corresponding
 competitive advantages gained through TQM. The
 setting for this examination was the general medical
 hospital industry. This industry is particularly appro-
 priate for the study of the effectiveness of TQM pro-
 gram implementation since it commenced using
 TQM as an industrywide recipe for success in the
 mid to late 1980s and continues this effort to the
 present day (Westphal et al., 1997).

 THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT

 Recent literature has begun to describe and eval-
 uate TQM as a potential source of competitive ad-
 vantage (Powell, 1995). The implementation of
 TQM is accomplished through a set of practices
 that supports the TQM philosophy (Dean & Bowen,
 1994). TQM philosophy dictates that the practices

 function as an interdependent system (Hackman &
 Wageman, 1995) that can combine with other orga-
 nizational assets to generate competitive advantage
 (Powell, 1995). As Schendel (1994) pointed out,
 competitive advantage is based not on individual
 assets or practices that can be easily duplicated, but
 on the combination of a series of assets that he
 labeled "compound assets." Drawing from the re-
 cent literature on TQM (Dean & Bowen, 1994;
 Hackman & Wageman, 1995; Powell, 1995), we
 identified seven key or common practices that
 combine to support the TQM philosophy. These
 practices are: top management team involvement,
 adoption of a quality philosophy, emphasis on
 TQM-oriented training, focus on the customer, con-
 tinuous improvement of processes, management by
 fact, and use of TQM methods.

 To gain the full potential of TQM, a hospital must
 implement all seven of these TQM practices to the
 greatest extent possible. According to industry ex-
 perts, proper implementation of TQM in hospitals
 is a critical determinant in enhancing organiza-
 tional performance (Shortell et al., 1995; Westphal
 et al., 1997). As Carmen and his colleagues (1996)
 pointed out in their study of TQM in hospitals,
 some organizations are much more deliberate and
 comprehensive in their implementation of TQM
 than are others. This variability in implementation
 efforts emphasizes the importance of focusing on
 the depth of the implementation, not just on the
 mere presence of a TQM program. Unfortunately,
 very few past researchers have attempted to so mea-
 sure degree of implementation (Hackman & Wage-
 man, 1995).

 Preliminary evidence from Powell (1995) indi-
 cated that TQM-adopting firms do obtain a compet-
 itive advantage over firms that do not adopt TQM.
 Consequently, theory and research suggest that the
 greater the degree to which a comprehensive set of
 TQM practices is adopted by a hospital, the greater
 the competitive advantages achieved, and the
 higher the hospital's performance. Therefore, the
 following hypothesis is offered:

 Hypothesis 1. The degree of implementation of
 TQM practices in a hospital is positively re-
 lated to the hospital's performance.

 A number of scholars have argued that a support-
 ive organizational structure is needed to enhance
 the effectiveness of TQM implementation (Shea &
 Howell, 1998; Waldman & Gopalakrishnan, 1996).
 Sitkin, Sutcliffe, and Schroeder (1994) argued that
 the effectiveness of total quality management de-
 pends on an organization's ability to balance con-
 trol and learning. The need for control is evident in
 TQM's use of formal scientific methods for the

 elimination of variation using statistical process
 control (Hackman & Wageman, 1995). The need for
 learning is evident in TQM's emphasis on organi-
 zational learning and continuous improvement
 (Grant, 1996).

 Shea and Howell (1998) presented compelling
 arguments that the monodimensional mechanistic/
 organic structural scale proposed by Burns and
 Stalker (1961) is no longer appropriate in a TQM
 environment. Instead, they suggested two dimen-
 sions-the first focusing on level of standardization
 and the second on level of decentralization. They
 argued that standardization of TQM techniques and
 feedback loops helps an organization to control its
 systems and processes. However, decentralization
 is also necessary to allow employees to explore and
 experiment with creative process improvement
 ideas.

 Recent theory and research on organizational
 structure, independent of the TQM literature, is
 coming to the same conclusion. Eisenhardt and
 Tabrizi (1995) argued that organizational structure
 must have a stabilizing (that is, controlling) and
 creative (exploring) impact on organizations, espe-
 cially in turbulent environments. Similarly, Sut-
 cliffe, Sitkin, and Browning (1999) argued that or-
 ganizational structure must both standardize opera-
 tions across an organization to ensure the reliability
 of outcomes (the control dimension) and at the
 same time keep the organization open and flexible
 to new ideas (the exploration dimension). Perhaps
 summing this up best, Stacey maintained that
 organizations need to maintain a creative tension
 "between the clear-cut, rigid forms of control re-
 quired to handle the knowable and the spontaneity
 necessary to handle the unknowable" (1992: 184).
 Evidence from recent studies in the hospital in-
 dustry provides some support for the need to have
 both the control and exploratory dimensions of
 structure for the successful implementation of
 TQM. Carmen and his colleagues (1996), in their
 in-depth study of ten hospitals, found that a con-
 tinuous learning culture enhanced the relationship
 between continuous improvement and hospital
 performance. Shortell and coauthors (1995) found
 similar results, but they also emphasized the need
 for a formal, strategic quality plan to be present to
 ensure superior efficiency. Finally, Motwani,
 Sower, and Brashier (1996) prescribed a structured,
 standardized approach for the successful imple-
 mentation of TQM in hospitals. Given this theory
 and preliminary research, the following hypotheses
 are advanced:

 Hypothesis 2. In a hospital characterized by a
 greater focus on control in its structure, the

 degree of implementation of TQM practices
 will be more strongly, positively related to hos-
 pital performance.

 Hypothesis 3. In a hospital characterized by a
 greater focus on exploration in its structure,
 the degree of implementation of TQMpractices
 will be more strongly, positively related to hos-
 pital performance.

 METHODS

 Data Collection

 The study was conducted within a single indus-
 try, general medical hospitals (Standard Industrial
 Classification code 8062). By controlling for overall
 industry effects, we were able to limit confounding
 influences and focus on the key variables of inter-
 est. In addition, TQM has been recommended to
 the members of this industry as a strategy that will
 assist them in dealing with their turbulent environ-
 ment, although the degree of implementation has
 varied considerably.

 Both primary and secondary data were gathered
 for the analysis. From a list of 55 standard metro-
 politan statistical areas (SMSAs) in the United
 States that contained at least 15 general hospitals,
 we randomly selected 19 metropolitan areas. Then,
 in the fall of 1996, we sent questionnaires to the
 chief executive officer and the director of quality at
 each of the 512 hospitals in these 19 SMSAs. Fi-
 nally, we combined the survey data with secondary
 information available for the responding hospitals.
 We received at least one questionnaire from each
 of 193 hospitals, achieving an overall response rate
 of 38 percent. From 36 of these (19%), we received
 questionnaires from both the CEO and the director
 of quality; from 56 (29%), we only got back the CEO
 questionnaire; and from 101 (52%), we only re-
 ceived the questionnaire sent to the director of
 quality. These responses resulted in a total of 229
 returned surveys and an individual response rate of
 22 percent.

 In an effort to assess the potential for response
 bias, we made comparisons across a number of
 available variables for both the responding and the
 nonresponding hospitals for the 19 SMSAs using
 data from the 1995 American Hospital Associa-
 tion's Annual Survey of Hospitals. The mean re-
 sults for nonrespondents did not differ signifi-
 cantly from those for respondents when we
 compared assets, number of employees, profitabil-
 ity, or services offered. As a result, there does not
 appear to be systematic response bias in the finan-
 cial and operating characteristics of the hospitals
 sampled.

 Variables and Measures

 Organizational performance. Organizational fi-
 nancial performance, adjusted for industry effects,
 has been used as a proxy for the supranormal rents
 associated with competitive advantage (Mont-
 gomery & Wernerfelt, 1988; Powell, 1995). To en-
 sure the completeness and timeliness of the infor-
 mation, we obtained the principal measure of
 performance for the study directly from the respon-
 dents in our survey instrument. There are many
 precedents in the literature for obtaining perfor-
 mance information on a primary basis (e.g., Covin,
 Slevin, & Schultz, 1994; Powell, 1995). The five-
 item measure used in this study was adapted from
 scales used by Powell (1995) and Ramanujam, Ven-
 katraman, and Caraillus (1986). Specific items for
 this scale are listed in the Appendix.

 The coefficient of reliability for the perceived
 performance measure was .90. To further verify the
 reliability of this measure, we conducted a one-way
 analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the similarity
 among the within-organization responses (Amason,
 1996). The results revealed that the between-hospi-
 tals variance was significantly greater than the
 within-hospital variance (F = 3.80, p < .001), sug-
 gesting substantial agreement among the within-
 hospital respondents. Direct comparison was also
 made across the five-item scales received from the
 36 hospitals that had multiple respondents. On
 these five-point scales, 93 percent of the responses
 were exactly the same or within one category. As an
 additional test, these responses were also split into
 two groups, those from the directors of quality and
 those from the CEOs. T-tests conducted on the
 means of each of the performance items demon-
 strated no significant differences between the two
 groups.

 To test the convergent validity of this perceptual
 measure, we averaged the 1996 and 1997 returns on
 assets (ROAs) relative to those of competitors for 57
 hospitals in 6 of the 19 SMSAs in the original
 sample. Data were obtained from the American
 Hospital Directory database. The correlation be-
 tween the two-year average archival ROA relative
 to competitors and our perceptual performance
 measure was significant (r = .40, p < .01).

 In addition to the perceptual measure, we also
 obtained each hospital's overall score from the lat-
 est audit conducted by the Joint Commission on
 Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. This
 industry-expert-rated measure is based on a compre-
 hensive audit of 49 standards related to internal hos-
 pital processes conducted once every three years.
 Hospitals are under considerable institutional pres-
 sure to perform well in these areas (Westphal et al.,

 1997). Thus, although this measure is not a direct
 assessment of competitive advantage, it may be an
 alternative proxy for measuring competitive advan-
 tages gained through successful TQM programs (Coff,
 1999). To more fully assess the relationship between
 TQM and organizational performance, we tested the
 hypotheses using both the perceived financial perfor-
 mance measure and the industry expert rating of per-
 formance.

 TQM practices. The seven TQM practices exam-
 ined in our analysis have been identified in recent
 research (Dean & Bowen, 1994; Hackman & Wage-
 man, 1995; Powell, 1995); the Appendix gives the
 specific scales and items used. We sought to com-
 prehensively gauge the degree to which TQM had
 been implemented within an organization with
 these 36 items. A factor analysis of the items con-
 firmed the existence of seven factors. Each item
 loaded on the expected scale, and eigenvalues
 ranged from 0.91 to 17.5, with 72 percent of the
 cumulative variation explained (p < .001). Reliabil-
 ity coefficients (alphas) and one-way ANOVAs
 were calculated; the alphas ranged from .85 to .92,
 signifying that the scales were reliable. Further-
 more, the F-tests associated with the one-way
 ANOVAs for each of the scales were significant. In
 sum, our scales appeared to demonstrate accept-
 able psychometric properties.

 We constructed the factor scores by averaging
 each organization's item responses for the respec-
 tive scales. These seven factor scores were then
 subjected to a final factor analysis to determine if
 the TQM construct represented one or more latent
 variables. Both the principal components and max-
 imum likelihood techniques provided similar re-
 sults, with all seven of the variables loading on a
 single factor. The eigenvalue for this factor was
 4.89, which explained 70 percent of the variation.
 Therefore, in our data set, only one factor was iden-
 tified representing the construct of degree of TQM
 practices adopted. We computed the aggregated
 average of these seven variables to create the
 TQM practices variable that was used in the sub-
 sequent analysis. The coefficient alpha for this
 scale was .93.

 Organizational structure. To measure organiza-
 tional structure, we adapted the seven-item scale
 originally developed by Khandwalla (1977) and re-
 cently used by Covin et al. (1994). The items were
 factor-analyzed to verify the existence of two dis-
 tinct factors representing control and exploration.
 This analysis confirmed the existence of these two
 factors in our data set. The first factor, structural
 control, accounted for 46 percent of the variance,
 with an eigenvalue of 2.29. The three items loading
 on this factor measured the degree that the organi-

 zational structure emphasized the control of proce-
 dures, systems, and job descriptions. The reliability
 associated with this scale was .66. The second fac-
 tor, structural exploration, consisted of two items
 measuring the exploration capability of the organi-
 zations with respect to allowing the flow of finan-
 cial and operating information throughout the or-
 ganization and the freedom to depart from past
 practices to adapt to a changing environment. This
 factor had an eigenvalue of 1.06 and accounted for
 21 percent of the variance. The reliability of this
 scale was .67. Once again, the specific items used
 are listed in the Appendix.

 These two scales should be considered explor-
 atory since this is the first study to use these two
 distinct factors to represent the control and explo-
 ration aspects of organizational structure. Khand-
 walla's (1977) original scale demonstrated a reli-
 ability of .68, similar to the ones exhibited by these
 two scales. Nunnally (1978) considered this level of
 reliability acceptable for the early or initial stages
 of basic research. Future studies should increase
 the number of items in each scale to increase their
 reliability.

 Control variables. Following prominent studies
 of the hospital industry (e.g., Ketchen, Thomas, &
 Snow, 1993), we used the number of hospital beds
 as a proxy for organization size. We obtained these
 data from the 1995 American Hospital Associa-
 tion's Annual Survey of Hospitals.

 Hospital ownership has also been recognized as a
 potentially important variable in this industry. For-
 profit and not-for-profit hospitals can be expected
 to have different organizational goals and unique
 groups of stakeholders (Zajac & Shortell, 1989).
 Thus, it is important to classify each organization
 into one of these two categories (1 = "for profit,"
 2 = "not-for-profit"). These data were collected
 from the 1996 edition of the Hospital Blue Book.

 Since the market for resources is regional for
 hospitals (Ketchen et al., 1993), it is important to
 include a measure of market growth in the SMSA in
 which the hospital operates. The growth rate for
 each local market area was calculated using the
 linear trend in the natural logarithm of the popula-
 tion estimates. The population data (1991-95) were
 obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.

 The level of competition in the hospital industry
 may also influence organizational performance,
 and it is measured at the local market area, or
 SMSA. In line with recent research (Boyd, 1990),
 we chose to use a Herfindahl index to measure this
 construct in our study. Calculated using market
 share data as input, the Herfindahl index repre-
 sents perfect competition when it registers a score
 of 0, and a score of 1 portrays a monopoly situation.

 Market share information for 1994 was obtained
 from the 1995 American Hospital Association's An-
 nual Survey of Hospitals for all hospitals in the 19
 SMSAs represented in the study.

 RESULTS

 The descriptive statistics of the variables used in

 the hypothesis tests are displayed in Table 1. The
 collinearity diagnostics, including the variance in-
 flation factors, all indicated that multicollinearity
 was not a problem. In addition, Table 1 contains
 the means and standard deviations of the seven
 individual TQM practices detailed in the Appendix
 along with their correlations relative to the two
 performance variables.

 Tables 2 and 3 show the results of hierarchical
 regression analyses. Hypothesis 1 was tested by
 comparing the increase in variance explained from
 model 1 to model 2 (Tables 2 and 3). Model 1
 represents the regression of the control variables on
 the performance variable (perceived financial per-
 formance in Table 2 and industry-expert-rated per-
 formance in Table 3), and model 2 adds TQM prac-
 tices to both sets of regressions. In each instance,
 the test statistic (F; Cohen, 1968) for the change in
 the multiple squared correlation statistic (R2) is
 significant.

 The results indicate that the degree of TQM prac-

 tices implemented is positively and significantly
 related to both the perceived financial performance
 of a hospital (t = 2.93, p < .01) and its industry-
 expert-rated performance (t = 2.00, p < .05). There-

 fore, Hypothesis 1 is well supported by our data.
 The results indicate that the degree to which TQM
 practices are implemented is significantly related
 to both of these measures of organizational perfor-
 mance, providing evidence of the robustness of this
 relationship.

 To explore the moderating influence of organiza-
 tional structure postulated in Hypotheses 2 and 3,
 we created model 3 by adding the first-order inter-
 actions between structural control and exploration
 and TQM practices to model 2 for both perfor-
 mance measures. The associated F-tests displayed
 in Tables 2 and 3 signify that significant additional
 variance is explained with respect to financial
 performance in Table 2, but not with respect to
 industry-expert-rated performance in Table 3.
 Therefore, we found some empirical support for the
 moderating impact of organizational structure with
 respect to organizational performance, since each
 of the two-way interaction terms, TQM with struc-
 tural control (t = -2.88, p < .01) and TQM with
 structural exploration (t = 2.19, p < .05), was sig-
 nificant. These results partially support Hypothe-
 ses 2 and 3.

 To determine the exact nature of these moderat-
 ing relationships identified in Table 2, we con-
 ducted additional interpretative analyses. Using
 standard graphical techniques, we found that hos-
 pitals operating with relatively high structural con-
 trol exhibited a stronger relationship between the
 TQM practices implemented and financial perfor-
 mance and that hospitals with relatively lax struc-
 tural controls did not demonstrate a significant re-

 trast, the relationship between TQM and financial

 lower levels of structural exploration. Figure 1 dis-
 plays the graphs of these contingent effects. These
 findings offer new and practical insights into the
 complementary nature of organizational structure
 and TQM practices.

 for industry-expert-rated performance. This finding
 provides some tentative support for the arguments
 of Sutcliffe et al. (1999), and it suggests that the
 relationship between the degree of TQM imple-
 mentation and financial performance is influenced
 by levels of both structural control and exploration.

 Our results suggested additional ad hoc analysis

 in light of the work of Sutcliffe and colleagues
 (1999). These researchers argued that control and
 exploration processes may be "synergistic" within
 an organization, signifying that these processes
 may be interdependent and mutually reinforcing.
 To test this possibility, we added a three-way in-
 teraction term to model 3; the results appear as
 model 4 in Tables 2 and 3. The three-way interac-
 tion, TQM with control and exploration, is signifi-
 cant and positive (t - 2.05, p < .05) for the finan-
 cial performance equation, but it is not significant

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

 Theoretical Implications

 This study has addressed whether the capabili-
 ties generated by TQM are related to competitive
 advantage. With respect to our principal hypothe-
 sis, we found strong empirical support for a posi-
 tive relationship between the degree of TQM im-
 plementation and organizational performance. We
 also found some empirical evidence that this rela-
 tionship between TQM implementation and orga-

 nizational performance was moderated by organi-
 zational structure.

 The results of this study contribute to the rapidly
 developing total quality management literature
 (Westphal et al., 1997) in that it is the first large-
 scale study to confirm the expected positive rela-
 tionship between the degree of implementation of
 TQM practices and overall organizational perfor-
 mance. Recognizing that TQM practices develop
 along different time frames within each organiza-
 tion (Carmen et al., 1996), identification of the ex-
 tent to which these practices have been imple-
 mented throughout an organization allows for a
 more complete understanding of TQM's value
 (Hackman & Wageman, 1995). In short, TQM ap-
 pears to be more than an either/or proposition. Our
 study reveals that one important aspect of TQM
 success is the degree to which the entire TQM
 philosophy has been implemented; the rhetoric
 that surrounds it and the mere presence of a TQM
 program are not sufficient for success. For example,
 one of the respondents from a hospital in Phoenix
 reported that "although the top administrators give
 CQI [continuous quality improvement] lip service,
 their actions do not support it and few resources
 are provided." Future researchers are encouraged
 to include a measure of degree of implementation
 when studying TQM programs.

 Westphal and his colleagues (1997) have pointed
 out that the information emanating from large-scale
 empirical research on TQM has been scarce and
 inconclusive. The most noteworthy exception is
 Powell's (1995) study of 39 firms that implemented
 some TQM practices. He found that although TQM-
 adopting firms outperformed nonadopters, many of
 the basic TQM practices failed to correlate directly
 with organizational performance. We have built on
 Powell's (1995) findings by examining the progress
 that each studied hospital made "moving up the
 experience curve" toward full implementation of a
 comprehensive set of TQM practices. Notably, we
 found that the hospitals that had more completely
 implemented a comprehensive array of TQM prac-
 tices outperformed those that had less well-devel-
 oped programs.

 Powell (1995) also wrote that complementary or-
 ganizational resources might need to be in place for
 some of the TQM practices to be effective, but he
 did not empirically investigate this relationship.
 Our study breaks new ground in the TQM literature
 by identifying a complex relationship between or-
 ganizational structure and TQM implementation
 success. This finding supports recent conceptual
 arguments that both control and learning are nec-
 essary in order to take advantage of TQM in chang-
 ing environments (Sitkin et al., 1994).

 Hospitals that exhibited strong emphasis on
 structural control of procedures, operations, and
 work activities exhibited a stronger relationship
 between their TQM implementation and financial
 performance. This finding supports observations
 made by Lillrank, Shani, Kolodny, Stymne,
 Figuera, and Liu (1998) that continuous improve-
 ment can effectively be integrated into an organiza-
 tion via job descriptions and other administrative
 procedures. By standardizing the use of specific
 TQM tools and techniques within an organization's
 formal procedures, it appears that hospitals can
 continuously improve effectiveness and efficiency
 (Shortell et al., 1995).

 Hospitals that demonstrated a higher level of
 structural exploration also displayed a stronger re-
 lationship between TQM implementation and fi-
 nancial performance. It appears that organiza-
 tions that provide employees access to key
 information and empower them to adapt their
 processes to environmental changes are better
 able to use TQM for competitive advantage. This
 finding reinforces Hackman and Wageman's
 (1995) arguments that TQM needs a strong learn-
 ing environment in which to function since em-
 ployees are expected to use data about their work
 processes for continuous improvement.

 Our findings also provide critical insights for the
 recent dialogue on the need to balance both control
 and learning within an organization (Eisenhardt &
 Tabrizi, 1995; Sutcliffe et al., 1999). Not only did
 we find that both structural concepts enhanced the
 relationship between TQM implementation and fi-
 nancial performance separately; we also found that
 control and exploration appeared to work synergis-
 tically to enhance this relationship even further.
 Sutcliffe and colleagues (1999) presented three pos-
 sible scenarios in their discussion of the need to
 balance control and learning. The first portrays the
 balance as antithetical, with emphasis on either
 control or learning at the expense of the other. The
 second scenario describes control and learning as
 orthogonal concepts that are each important to or-
 ganizations. The third scenario presents a synergis-
 tic system whereby control and learning are mutu-
 ally reinforcing. Sutcliffe and colleagues discuss an
 example of a high-tech manufacturing firm that
 demonstrated that breakthrough learning within
 their TQM system could be quickly routinized into
 their organizational processes for efficiency. Our
 findings in the hospital industry provide some new
 evidence that TQM-adopting organizations have
 also experienced the synergistic effects of balanc-
 ing structural control and learning.

 The recent metaphor of jazz improvisation in
 organizational theory (Weick, 1998) has heightened

 our awareness that organizations must balance ap-
 parently paradoxical processes in a manner that
 allows them to continually adapt to their environ-
 ments. Our finding with respect to the complemen-
 tary impact of two seemingly opposing structure
 variables supports the implications found in this
 theoretical insight.

 However, our conclusions must be tentative
 about the moderating impact of structure on TQM
 implementation success because we failed to find a
 moderating effect of organizational structure on im-
 plementation success for the industry-expert-rated
 measure of performance. One possible explanation
 for this nonfinding is that the financial perfor-
 mance measure is a more valid and reliable proxy
 of competitive advantage than the expert-rated-
 performance measure. Buttressing this argument
 are the high correlations (Table 1) between all
 seven of the TQM practices and the financial per-
 formance measure (average r = .29); only five of the
 seven TQM practices were correlated with the ex-
 pert-rated-measure, however (average r = .19). No-
 tably, the two practices that were not correlated
 were "customer driven" and "continuous improve-
 ment"-both known to be critical to competitive
 advantage (e.g., Dean & Bowen, 1994). Future re-
 search should explore multiple performance mea-
 sures in other industries to determine if our lack of
 findings was due to the problems with our perfor-
 mance measures or due to a more complicated re-
 lationship than was explored in this study.

 Managerial Implications

 This study has important implications for manag-

 ers. First, it encourages them to invest in the time and
 resources necessary to implement comprehensive
 TQM programs, not just selected aspects of TQM. It
 also suggests that seven specific practices-top man-
 agement team involvement, quality philosophy,
 TQM-oriented training, customer-driven changes,
 continuous improvement, management by fact, and
 TQM techniques-appear to operate as an integrated
 system.

 Second, this study suggests the importance of
 ensuring that a supportive organizational structure
 is in place. Managers have been offered rather sim-
 plistic structural prescriptions in the past (Eisen-
 hardt & Tabrizi, 1995), but the evidence from this
 study provides tentative support for the argument
 that firms must balance both control and explora-
 tion in order to use TQM in a way that is both
 effective and efficient. An organization seems to
 need to provide the structural mechanisms that
 enable TQM techniques to be woven into its fabric
 (Lillrank et al., 1998) while allowing for the devel-

 opment and integration of new knowledge and
 ways to create customer value (Grant, 1996). If
 these things do not happen, firms may encounter a
 situation in which TQM doesn't add value.

 Limitations

 Despite these encouraging results, several limita-
 tions of this study should be emphasized. First, the
 sampling frame limits the generalizability of the
 results. The organizations in this study were drawn
 from a single industry, general hospitals. Although
 this sampling frame allowed us to control for global
 environmental factors and to provide results for a
 major service industry, it does limit the generaliz-
 ability of results. Since health care involves life-
 and-death decisions involving activities that are
 often highly regulated, the insights gained here
 about total quality practices may not apply to other
 industries.

 The two performance measures used in this
 study must also be viewed within the context of the
 hospital industry. The use of perceived financial
 performance is appropriate for most industries, but
 the industry-expert-rated measure is specific to the
 hospital industry and represents a hospital's ability
 to meet institutional demands. This industry-
 specific measure appears to be little related to a
 hospital's ability to earn superior rents, focusing
 instead on the ability to achieve process objectives
 ultimately related to appropriate patient care. Coff
 (1999) presented strong arguments that rents asso-
 ciated with competitive advantage can be shared
 across multiple stakeholders. If this is true, then the
 use of multiple performance indicators appropriate
 for the industry under study, should be considered.
 It may well be that the advantage attributable to
 TQM may be appropriated across shareholders,
 which would then be reflected in both traditional
 and nontraditional measures of performance. This
 potential outcome should be tested using alterna-
 tive measures of performance, as was done in this
 study. Therefore, it would be beneficial for future
 research to look at other industries in order to val-
 idate the above results in different settings.

 Second, this study was cross-sectional. Although
 the model developed from the theory implied cer-
 tain causal relationships, the causality could not be
 confirmed with our cross-sectional research design.
 A longitudinal study would be beneficial in order
 to confirm the directionality of the relationships
 identified in our results.

 Third, the concept of total quality management is
 sufficiently diverse that it is difficult to compre-
 hensively measure it (Steel & Jennings, 1992). We
 measured the concept of teamwork indirectly as the

 practice labeled "top management team involve-
 ment." However, some scholars have argued that
 teamwork throughout an entire organization is in-
 tegral to the TQM philosophy (Hackman & Wage-
 man, 1995). Thus, researchers conducting future
 studies of TQM may want to assess teamwork more
 explicitly and throughout entire organizations to
 make this TQM implementation measure more ro-
 bust.

 Finally, the scales used to measure structural
 control and exploration should be considered ex-
 ploratory, given their modest reliability coefficients
 and small number of items. In future studies using
 these scales, use of additional items dealing with
 structural controls and exploratory mechanisms
 would increase the reliability of these two con-
 structs.

 Conclusions

 Despite the limitations discussed above, the
 study provides several important contributions to
 the literature. Notably, it clarifies the relationship
 between the degree of implementation of TQM
 practices and organizational performance and ten-
 tatively identifies complementary variables whose
 synergistic effect enhances this relationship. The
 study findings provide relatively robust support for
 the aggressive adoption of TQM in its entirety. As
 Hackman and Wageman (1995) suggested, total
 quality management, properly implemented and
 combined with the appropriate organizational vari-
 ables, may be a vehicle that allows organizations to
 dynamically maintain a fit with their environments
 in a competitive and sustainable fashion.
