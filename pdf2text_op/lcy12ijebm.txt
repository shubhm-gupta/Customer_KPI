ABSTRACT 

This  paper  examines  the  effect  of  supply  chain  and  third  party  involvement  on  product 
innovation  performance.  The  concept  of  supply  chain  network  is  studied  as  the  type  of 
external  member  collaboration  for  firm  new  product  development.  This  study  collected 
information  about  208  manufacture  firms  from  Taiwan;  we  investigated  the  contingent 
effect of supply chain member involvement on product innovation performance. The result 
indicate that external member involvement have positive impacts on a product innovation 
performance, and third party involvement within the supplier involvement is found to be as 
important  a  moderator  for  the  relationship  between  external  member  involvement  and 
product  innovation  performance.  The  relationship  between  customer  involvement  and 
market  performance  was  positively  moderated,  but  between  supplier  involvement  and 
design performance was negatively moderated by third party involvement.

1. INTRODUCTION 

One  of  prevailing  findings 

in  concurrent 
inter-firm  network  and  supply  chain  management 
research is that customer and suppliers can reap great 
potential  benefits  by  working  together  the  new 
product  development  (NPD)  process.  Over  the  past 
two decades, several researchers have shown that new 
product  development  has  become  an  increasingly 
important  to  the  development  and  maintenance  of  a 
strong  position 
increasingly  competitive 
business  arena  [15,  56].  Consequently,  the  demands 
on  new  product  development  performance,  in  terms 
of speed, performance, quality, and cost, have become 
more stringent. Today’s leading enterprises operate on 
a  global  basis,  cooperating  with  suppliers,  partners, 
and  a  multitude  of  stakeholders  to  deliver  product 

in  an

packages  [45].  Therefore,  new  product  development 
must come from within the supply chain or network. 
Companies  experience  constant  pressure  to 
deliver superior value to the customers. In addition to 
resource  inputs,  this  requires  a  set  of  processes  to 
coordinate  efforts  and  improve  results.  Increasingly, 
many  of  these  capabilities  and  resources  reside 
outside the boundaries a single firm. Earlier and more 
extensive  involvement  of  suppliers  and  customer  in 
new  product  development  is  one  of  the  ways 
companies can enhance product development in terms 
of productivity, speed, quality [14, 50] market share, 
sales volume, and market growth. Suppliers provide a 
source  of  innovative  ideas  and  critical  technologies 
[5,  12].  Customers  provide  demand  and  market 
knowledge [35, 40, 65, 66]. However, several studies 
demonstrate  that  managing  supplier  involvement  in 
product  development  poses  several  challenges  [11, 
30]. On the other hand, other scholars believe that the 
network and the relationships in themselves have an 
impact  on  how  industrial  firms  gain  and  deal  with

chain  relationships  focus  on  the  auto  industry  [14], 
and  tend  to  emphasize  operations  and  total  quality 
management 
than  marketing.  However, 
companies  do  not  develop  new  products  simply  to 
improve quality or reduce costs. There are market and 
financial  performance  incentives  as  well.  Therefore, 
this study further clarifies the supply chain members 
involved  in  the  new  product  development  process. 
Specifically,  design  and  market  performance  help

A  comparison  of 
that

them from general operational performance financial

scholars have challenged the conventional notion that 
innovations  in  the  supply  chain  context  originate 
from  the  buyer  alone.  In  the  current  complex

Based  on  this  concept,  this  study  shows  that 
innovation results from interactions within buy-seller 
relationships 
that  a 
substantial  part  of  the  innovation  process  occurs 
between  buyers  and  sellers  in  the  supply  chain  [28, 
36]. This has led to the emergence of a large body of

2.1 Effects of Customer Involvement 

The  importance  of  lead  customers  in  defining 
product  innovation,  and  therefore  reducing  the  risk 
associated  with  the  market  introduction,  has  been 
recognized  since  at  least  the  1970s  [24,  49,  52,  53, 
59, 61, 62]. A review of previous studies reveals the 
following  advantages  of  customer 
involvement:

providing  complementary  knowledge,  providing  an 
understanding of customer demand; auxiliary pricing, 
etc.  Gemunden,  Heydebreck,  and  Herden  [25] 
showed  that  customer  contact  is  a  prerequisite  for 
success, and that allowing customers to participate in 
the  early  stages  of  new  product  development  is 
important  [38].  Research  by  Sherman,  Souder,  and 
Jenssen  (2000)  [54]  shows 
the 
customer in the R&D team reduces the development 
time of new products. However, these findings are the 
requirements; 
result  of  a  company’s  one-way 
customers  only  provide 
the 
participation is therefore relatively low. According to 
Gadde  and  Snehota’s  [23]  classification  of  high 
involvement,  a  high  level  of  customer  involvement 
must include relation-specific investment and a high 
level  of  interaction.  The  most  obvious  effect  of 
customer participation in new product development is 
better  time  performance  in  market  and  technical 
development  [14,  54];  these  are  important  market 
performance  indicators.  Previous  studies  show  that 
customer  participation  primarily  affects  market 
performance,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  assists  in 
technical  aspects  such  as  design  performance. 
Therefore, this study infers the following hypothesis:

Research  on  new  product  development  shows 
that  three  of  these  firm-centered  factors  include 
design  for  cost,  design  for  quality,  and  design  for 
manufacturability  are  important  for  the  creation  of 
product 
[14].  Looking 
beyond the individual firm is necessary to recognize 
the  importance  of  technology  knowledge  in  the 
supply  chain  [58].  Although  many  studies  focus  on 
integrating  customer  requirements  into  new  product 
development  efforts  [26],  supplier  involvement  has 
only  recently  received  significant  attention  [46]. 
Along  with  the  need  to  integrate  multiple  linked

in-house capability can reduce the time it takes for a 
product  to  go  from  conception  to  the  market  place, 
improving  cost  and  quality,  and  achieving  better 
design performance [50]. Petersen et al. [46] used the 
inclusion  of  suppliers  in  new  product  development 
teams  to  verify  that  supplier  involvement  enhances

Benedetto [57] found that good suppliers facilitate the 
growth  of  a  product’s  market  share  and  improve 
financial  performance.  Supplier  involvement  boosts 
the design and market performance of manufacturers. 
Therefore, this study hypothesizes the following:

In

inter-organization  collaboration  improved  innovation

opposite to be the case. Wynstra, et al. [69] found that 
early  supplier  involvement  does  not  lower  costs  or 
improve  quality,  and  can  even  result  in  worse  than 
expected  results.  Belderbos,  et  al.  [10]  showed  that 
the involvement of third parties, such as universities 
or  research  institutions,  could  improve  productivity 
and  result  in  greater  sales  performance  in  the 
innovative product market. Universities are therefore 
an

innovation  knowledge.  Lynch  and  O’Toole  [38] 
conducted  a  survey  of  Ireland’s  manufacturing 
industry  and  found 
that  as  much  as  57%  of 
respondents involved third parties in the new product 
development. The main reasons for this involvement 
included 
requirements,

and  lowering  costs,  risks,  and  development  time.

3. METHODS 

 

3.1 Sample 

The primary sample of this study consisted of 
R&D  managers  and  executives  of  Taiwanese 
manufacturers. This study examines four major types 
of  manufacturing:  livelihood  industries  (including 
SIC08,  09,  10,  11,  13,  14,  22,  31),  the  chemical 
industry (including the SIC12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 
21),  information  and  electronic  industry  (including 
the SIC 26, 27, 28, 30), and metal machinery industry 
(including  the  SIC  23,  24,  25,  29).  These  industries 
were  targeted  to  produce  a  large  enough  sample  for 
subsequent  industry  analysis.  These  specific  SICs 
were  chosen  because  they  are  some  of  the  most 
visible  and  important  manufacturing  industries.  A 
questionnaire was used for data collection. This study 
received 245 surveys, but 37 of them were unusable 
as  several  parts  were  missing  or  the  responses 
appeared 
them 
unacceptable  for  data  analysis.  This  led  to  208 
useable  responses.  Table  1  describes  the  sample 
statistics  that  indicate  that  85.8%  of  the  responses 
came  from  the  targeted  SIC  codes.  The  majority  of 
development 
respondents  were

Supplier  involvement  was  measured  on  a 
four-item scale adapted from Lim et al. [34]; Walter 
[64]  and  Song  and  Benedetto  [57].  The  items 
included  (1)  suppliers  involved  in  early  stages  of 
product  development;  (2)  supplier  input  for  parts 
design;  (3)  supplier  input  for  prototype  test;  and  (4) 
product  development  people  meeting  suppliers. 
Supplier  input  for  parts  design  showed  a  low  factor

Customer  involvement  was  measured  on  a 
five-item  scale  adapted  from  Lim  et  al.  [34].  The 
items  included  involvement  in  the  early  stages  of 
product development, using customers as a source for 
ideas, 
customers’  needs,  using 
information  from  customers,  and  meetings  between 
product development people and customers. The last 
item showed a low factor loading, and then deleted.

Third party involvement was measured by five 
items  developed  specifically  for  this  study.  These 
items captured supplier and customer involvement in 
the  early,  prototype  test,  co-design,  information 
sharing, and meeting stages. 

Control  variables.  The  literature  suggests  that 
several 
industrial  variables  may  affect  product 
innovation performance. This study included several 
variables  commonly  used  as  control  variables  in 
research 
management 
studies, 
including 
turbulence,  and 
technological turbulence. The market turbulence and 
technological  turbulence  scales  were  adapted  from

This  study  used  LISREL  8.72  to  analyze  the

approach proposed by Anderson and Gerbing [4]. The 
factor  loading  t  value  was  between  7.85  and  15.18, 
and each of the measurable variables was significant 
that  was  consistent  with  Anderson  and  Gerbing  [4]. 
The  average  variance  extracted  (AVE)  of 
the 
measurable  variable  was  between  0.46  and  0.69, 
except that customer involvement was lower than the 
0.5 level recommended by Forrnel and Larcker [22]; 
the  others  variable  were  all  accepted.  These  results 
show that the proposed measurement model achieved 
a  good  convergent  validity.  Discriminant  validity  is 
obtained when all pair wise latent-trait correlations of 
constructs are significantly different from 1 [4]. Table 
3  shows  that  our  construct  measures  met  this 
requirement.  A  more 
criterion  of 
discriminate  validity  is  that  across  all  possible  pairs 
of constructs the variance extracted for each construct 
must  be  greater  than  the  squared  latent  correlation 
between a pair of constructs [22]. Table 2 shows that 
the diagonal elements representing the squared roots 
of  average  variance  extracted  values  for  each  of  the 
constructs  were  greater 
the  off-diagonal 
elements, thereby achieving discriminant validity.

4. RESULTS 

 

Regarding 

Following the Baron and Kenny [8] approach, 
the  main  and  moderating  effects  were  tested  using 
hierarchical multiple regression analyses. To mitigate 
the  potential  of  multicollinearity,  each 
scale 
constituting  an  interaction  term  was  mean  centered 
[1]. Table 4 summarizes the results.   
the  hypotheses

organization involvement enhance product innovation 
performance,  we  found  that  customer  involvement 
was  significantly  related  to  market  performance 
(β=.324  , p＜.001). However,  customer  involvement 
was  significantly  related  to  design  performance 
(β=.251,  p ＜ .001).  As  expected, 
the  supplier 
involvement  was  significantly  related  to  design

(Hypothesis  2b).  This  finding  revealed  a  different 
facet  of  customer  involvement,  partially  supporting 
Hypothesis  2a.  Moreover,  third  party  involvement 
was  significantly  related  to  design  and  market 
performance  (β=.323,  p ＜.001 ；β=.144,  p ＜.01). 
Third  party  involvement  had  a  moderating  effect  on 
the  relationship  between  supplier  involvement  and 
design  performance  (β=.-.142,  p ＜ .05),  but  no 
moderating  effect  on  market  performance.  This 
means  that  higher  levels  of  third  party  involvement 
increase  the  negative  relationship  between  suppliers 
and  design  performance.  These  results  support 
Hypothesis  3a,  but  not  Hypothesis  3b.  To  plot  this 
interaction  effect,  we  constrained  the  variables  in

specific 
characteristics and objectives of each type of partner 
suggest  that  different  partners  will  bring  different 
results.  In  this  sense,  the  decision  to  pool  resources 
with  another  organization  depends  on  weighing  the 
risks  against  the  expected  results [47]. Supply  chain

more  significant  impact  on  product  innovation  [39]. 
By considering the individual impact of each type of 
partner,  this  study  shows  that  supplier  involvement 
are  the  single  partners  who  most  impact  on  the 
achievement  of  product  design  with  more  degree  of 
performance. When third party and suppliers involved

time,  its  impact  is  weakened.  This  finding  indicates 
that  some  factors  remain  to  be  explored.  Future 
research stage to the sequence from the process and

5.2 Implications for Management 

and 

The  findings  of  this  study  contain  useful 
managerial  implications.  In  the  current  competitive 
environment,  the  achievement  of  product  innovation 
success  is  becoming  increasingly  important.  This 
study  shows  that  different  types  of  collaborative 
relationships  can  be  a  critical  success  factor  in 
achieving innovative products. The practical value of 
these  findings  lies  in  better  understanding  how  the 
type  of  a  collaborative  relationship  affects  its  own 
performance. Therefore, managers must be aware of 
the 
importance  of  partner  suitability,  network 
mechanisms, and continuity of collaboration, as these 
are  the  factors  that  determine  superior  collaborative 
performance 
the 
development of the firm’s competitive advantage.   

in  product 

innovation 

This  study  shows  that  the  involvement  of 
different  external  organizations  produces  different 
results.  This  provides  businesses  with  a  practical 
choice  of  partners.  For  example,  when  companies 
wish  to  pursue  design  performance,  they  must  not 
overlook  the  effects  of  the  expertise  of  industry 
customers  on  product  innovation  performance,  in 
addition to supplier and third party participation. If an 
organization  wants 
its  market 
performance,  its  can  employ  the  customer  and  third 
party participation model, with customer participation 
being the most important factor.

5.3 Limitations and Future Research 

This study is not free from limitations. It would 
be  desirable  to  have  complete  information  on  the 
degree  of  product  innovation,  either  using  a  richer 
category  of  innovation  or  qualitative  measures  of 
innovation  performance.  In  addition, 
this  study 
examines 
third-party  participation  using  only 
universities  and  government  research  institutions. 
However,

technologies or new businesses should emphasize the 
participation  of  third-party  research  organizations 
[48].  Most  technologies  coming  out  of  universities 
are  at  the  early  stages  of  development  [60].  The 
commercialization  of  such  emerging  technologies 
often takes a long time, while the development of this 
stage  is  usually  a  sudden  correction  or  refining 
conditions,  and  further  develop  firm  business  new

has the need for external organizations to participate 
in 
individual 
organizations  participating 
in  product  design 
performance have a positive influence on the results. 
However,  when  the  company  involves  third-party 
suppliers  and  research  institutions  in  new  product 
development,  the  effect  was  less  significant.  This 
result  agrees  with  the  previous  study,  showing  that 
when the basic research expertise of universities and 
research  institutions  is  applied  to  the  interaction  of 
suppliers, it is less effective. This study suggests that 
for  enterprises  wishing  to  improve  the  quality  of 
existing  products  or  decrease  supplier  costs  using 
technical  knowledge, 
improving  product  design 
performance will be a significant help. However, care 
must  be  taken  when  introducing  the  basic  scientific 
research  of  third-party  researchers  due  to  differing 
objectives,  schedules,  and  cognitive  differences. 
Future  studies  should  examine  different  product 
innovation and industry life cycles to confirm if this 
difference  really  exists.  Future  research  should  pay

third parties on product innovation performance, and 
is  not  applicable  to  all  industries.  For  example,  it  is 
not applicable to the hot topic of service innovation. 
Future  research  on  this  topic  should  examine  the 
service  industry  or  non-profit  organizations,  and 
explore the effects that external organizations have on 
innovation performance. Secondly, in addition to the 
moderating variable of third party that is employed in 
this  study,  future  research  should  consider  other 
variables or mechanisms, such as the discovery by De 
Luca and Atuahene-Gima (2007) [17] that knowledge 
integration mechanisms have a moderating effect on 
product  innovation  performance  in  inter-functional 
cooperation.  Further 
could 
examine 
inter-organizational  collaboration  and 
innovation 
performance.  Lastly,  we  would  like  to  point  out  the 
generalizability of these finding. Although the data in 
this  study  is  limited  to  Taiwan,  the  patterns  of 
collaboration  in  Taiwan  are  similar  to  those  of  the 
China.
