Media Reputation as a Strategic
Resource: An Integration of Mass

Communication and Resource-Based

Theories

David L. Deephouse

Louisiana State University

The resource-based view proposes that reputation is a resource
leading to competitive advantage. Past research tested this by using
Fortune ratings to measure reputation, but these ratings are theoreti-
cally weak. This paper integrates mass communication theory into past
research to develop a concept called media reputation, deﬁned as the
overall evaluation of a ﬁrm presented in the media. Theoretical and
empirical analyses indicate that media reputation is a resource that
increases the performance of commercial banks. © 2000 Elsevier Sci-

Reputation is receiving increased attention in strategic management because
it may be an intangible resource leading to sustained competitive advantage
(Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989). For instance, Hall (1992) found that U.K.
executives ranked reputation as the most important of thirteen intangible re-
sources. Using Fortune’s survey of America’s Most Admired Corporations to
measure reputation, past research found the Fortune ratings had a positive effect
on stock market and accounting performance (McMillan & Joshi, 1997; Roberts
& Dowling, 1997; Rupp & Hamilton, 1996; Srivastava, McInish, Wood, &
Capraro, 1997; Vergin & Qoronﬂeh, 1998). Unfortunately, inference is limited
because of well documented problems with these measures (Baucus, 1995; Brown
& Perry, 1994; Fombrun, 1996; Fryxell & Wang, 1994; Sodeman, 1995; Wood,
1995). Thus, much more research is needed to adequately examine the complex,
multidimensional reputation concept (Dollinger, Golden, & Saxton, 1997; Fom-
brun & Shanley, 1990; Gatewood, Gowan, & Lautenshlager, 1993).

This paper contributes to this gap in the research in two main ways. First, it
revisits the reputation concept and develops a variant called media reputation,
deﬁned as the overall evaluation of a ﬁrm presented in the media. Second, this

paper provides theoretical and empirical support for the conjecture that media
reputation is a strategic resource leading to competitive advantage. Detailed
analysis of the determinants and other consequences of media reputation is
beyond the scope of this study. The paper is structured as follows. The ﬁrst section
develops the media reputation concept by integrating reputation, communication,
and resource-based theories. It concludes by proposing that a more favorable
reputation increases performance. The second section describes the sample, the
measurement procedures, and the dynamic model used to test the proposition in
a panel of commercial banks. The third section reports the results. The paper
concludes with several research implications.

Theory Development

This section develops the conjecture that media reputation is a strategic
resource for ﬁrms in four steps. First, it brieﬂy reviews the resource-based view
of the ﬁrm and the general challenge of empirically testing the theory. Second, it
reviews the reputation concept and the use of the Fortune ratings as a measure of
reputation. Third, it presents an overview of research in mass communication and
its application to management that suggests why the media could be important in
the reputation process. The section concludes by integrating these research
streams to develop a formal proposition that a more favorable media reputation
increases performance.
Testing the Resource-Based View of the Firm

The resource-based view of the ﬁrm focuses on the assets, skills, capabilities,
and so forth, tied semipermanently to a ﬁrm that it uses to create competitive
advantage in its product markets (Barney, 1991; Caves, 1980; Hall, 1992; Werner-
felt, 1984). Many factors may be resources, such as: plant and equipment;
geographic location; knowledge and skills of employees, managers, and teams;
corporate structure, culture, and control systems; and brand loyalty (Barney, 1986;
Castanias & Helfat, 1991; Fiol, 1991; Rumelt, 1987; Wernerfelt, 1984). Many
theoretical papers listed different resource properties that indicate how beneﬁcial
a resource may be (Barney, 1991; Chi, 1994; Conner, 1991; Dierickx & Cool,
1989; Peteraf, 1993; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). Because consensus on a set of
properties that are analytically independent of each other has yet to emerge, this
paper uses those presented by Barney (1991): rare, valuable, imperfectly imitable,
and nonsubstitutable. These four incorporate many properties mentioned in other
papers, such as tangibility and social complexity.

Researchers are grappling to develop ways to test the resource-based view of
the ﬁrm. In their review of research methods in strategic management, Hitt,
Gimeno, and Hoskisson (1998: 13) wrote: “Empirical testing of the resource-
based view faces signiﬁcant challenges.” Godfrey and Hill (1995) pointed out that
the most valuable resources are unobservable— once they are observed (and later
measured), they are easier to imitate. Godfrey and Hill (1995) still endorsed trying
to measure resources

One approach to testing for the existence of a resource that incorporates
suggestions of Godfrey and Hill (1995) and Hitt et al. (1998) uses a two-step

process. The ﬁrst step identiﬁes a potential resource(s) and then analyzes it
theoretically in terms of the properties identiﬁed in past research. The second step
measures the proposed resource and shows it has a positive effect on performance.
One example of this approach is the work of Powell and Dent–Micallef (1997),
who focused on resources related to information technology (IT) among U.S.
retailers. Based on a survey of retail executives, they found that human and
business resources complementary to IT increased performance, but IT itself had
no effect because of its commodity-like nature. Another example is a study by
Russo and Fouts (1997), who focused on the importance of a ﬁrm’s environmental
performance in a multi-industry study using archival data. They found that higher
environmental ratings from Franklin Research increased return on assets, even
after controlling for other determinants of performance identiﬁed in a meta-
analysis (Capon, Farley, & Hoenig, 1990). This paper uses a similar two-step
process in examining media reputation.

Reputation and the Fortune Ratings

Past research proposed that a positive reputation is a resource leading to
competitive advantage (e.g., Barney, 1991; Hall, 1992). Reputation is used in a
number of disciplines, such as sociology and game theory, and each discipline has
its own conceptual deﬁnition. Reputation is deﬁned in this paper as the evaluation
of a ﬁrm by its stakeholders in terms of their affect, esteem, and knowledge (The
American Heritage College Dictionary, 1993: deﬁnition 1; Dollinger et al., 1997;
Fombrun, 1996: 37; Hall, 1992: 138). Reputation is an intangible asset that
belongs to the ﬁrm (Hall, 1992, 1993). A ﬁrm’s reputation is produced by the
interactions of the ﬁrm with its stakeholders and by information about the ﬁrm and
its actions circulated among stakeholders, including specialized information in-
termediaries (Daellenbach, Sharma, & Vredenburg, 1998; Fombrun, 1996; Logs-
don & Wartick, 1995). A ﬁrm builds its reputation not just by word but also, and
perhaps more importantly, by deed (Caudron, 1997; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990).
As noted by Hall (1993: 616), a positive reputation “is usually the product of years
of demonstrated superior competence.” Nevertheless, there are cases when rep-
utation diverges from competence. For instance, Argenti (1998) described how
Dow Corning’s product reputation tumbled during the silicone breast implant
controversy, even though scientiﬁc studies in places like the New England Journal
of Medicine and the Harvard Medical School were unable to implicate the
implants. Also, Wal-Mart was better known for buying American made products
than Kmart, even though Wal-Mart imported twice as much as Kmart did
(Thompson, Pinegar, & Kramer, 1995). A positive reputation is important for
competitive advantage because it signals stakeholders about the attractiveness of
the ﬁrm who are then more willing to contract with it (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990;
Weigelt & Camerer, 1988).

Empirical studies of reputation’s status as a resource used Fortune’s survey
of America’s Most Admired Corporations to measure reputation. This survey has
been published every year since 1982. Released early in the year, the Fortune
ratings are compiled from surveys of executives, directors, and analysts conducted
in the previous fall. Respondents score ﬁrms on eight attributes using a scale from

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT, VOL. 26, NO. 6, 2000

0 to 10. Research used not just the overall score to measure reputation but also its
individual attributes to measure corporate social responsibility, innovativeness,
and management quality (e.g., McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988;
McGuire, Schneeweis, & Branch, 1990; Rupp & Hamilton, 1996). Empirical
research found the overall score on the Fortune ratings had a positive effect on
stock market and accounting performance (McMillan & Joshi, 1997; Roberts &
Dowling, 1997; Srivastava, McInish, Wood, & Capraro, 1997; Vergin & Qoron-
ﬂeh, 1998).

Although these ﬁndings provide some support for the idea that reputation is
a source of competitive advantage, the conclusions that can be drawn from these
results are limited because of weaknesses in the Fortune ratings. First, the Fortune
ratings are highly correlated with ﬁnancial performance. For instance, Fombrun
and Shanley (1990) and Fryxell and Wang (1994) showed that all eight items on
the Fortune ratings loaded on a single factor. To address this, Brown and Perry
(1994) developed a method for removing the performance halo by regressing the
Fortune ratings on various performance measures and then using the residuals as
reputational and corporate social performance ratings. Still, Baucus (1995) criti-
cized the halo adjustment process as introducing different sources of variation and
being difﬁcult to replicate. Second, Fortune’s choice of executives, directors, and
analysts represents a limited set of stakeholders (Fombrun, 1996; Fryxell &
Wang, 1994; Wood, 1995). Other important stakeholders include customers,
suppliers, government agencies, special interest groups, employees, and so forth
(Clarkson, 1995; Fombrun, 1996; Freeman, 1984). Third, the Fortune ratings exist
only for the large U.S. ﬁrms in the survey. There is no evidence that reputation is
a resource increasing the performance of smaller or non-U.S. ﬁrms. And although
the Financial Times and Fortune recently introduced reputation measures for
global companies using an worldwide survey, these measures have some of the
same weaknesses of the U.S. Fortune ratings (e.g., both publications survey only
executives, analysts, and directors, although on an international basis). Finally,
Sodeman (1995) pointed out that the real purpose of the Fortune ratings was not
for the scientiﬁc study of reputation or social performance but to sell magazines,
a fact freely admitted by Fortune. In this light, it is likely these data were used
because they were easily available and longitudinal. As Wood (1995: 197– 8)
noted, this measure was “about the only game in town.” These weaknesses imply
the need to revisit the complex, multidimensional reputation concept (Dollinger et
al., 1997; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Gatewood et al., 1993) and develop a more
theoretically informed version of this abstract concept. This paper begins ﬁlling
this need by integrating mass communication research with reputation and re-
source-based research.

Mass Communication Research and its Application to Management

Mass communication research examines many topics, including the content
of the mass media, its production and delivery to audiences by media organiza-
tions, and the resulting effects on audiences (Ball–Rokeach & Cantor, 1986; Gans,
1979; Shoemaker & Reese, 1991; Smith, 1995). General conclusions from this
research form the basis of the two-part assumption that the media record public

knowledge and opinions about ﬁrms and inﬂuence public knowledge and opinions
about ﬁrms. This assumption, although based on research mainly about public
issues (e.g., Gans, 1979), has been used in management research (Brown &
Deegan, 1998; Chen & Meindl, 1991; Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Elsbach, 1994).
To wit, Fombrun and Shanley (1990: 240) observed: “The media themselves act
not only as vehicles for advertising and mirrors of reality reﬂecting ﬁrms’ actions,
but also as active agents shaping information through editorials and feature
articles.” The following highlights the communication research underlying this
assumption before reviewing management literature that used this assumption.

Much communication research has suggested the media record public knowl-
edge and opinions. Humans need to be aware of their social and physical
environment, and this need is both cultural and biological (Shoemaker, 1996). A
central function of the media is surveillance; the media specialize in providing
information about important aspects of the environment (Lasswell, 1949). News
“is an attempt to reconstruct the essential framework of an event” (Schramm,
1949: 288). From the individual journalist’s perspective, a thorough, unbiased
recording of events, issues, and opinions about them is an important practice
norm. A majority of journalists view their role as neutral disseminators of
information, according to Weaver and Wilhoit (1986). Similarly, the preamble of
the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists (1996) states: “The
duty of the journalist is to further those ends (justice and democracy) by seeking
truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues.” Of
course, these roles and duties are norms, not universals. The extent to which
journalists follow them may depend on a number of factors that are beyond the
scope of this paper. Individual media writers and their employing organizations
want to avoid being accused of bias and being publicly embarrassed by having to
retract inaccurate stories (Hallin, 1986; Tuchman, 1977). For example, Janet
Cooke and The Washington Post lost their 1980 Pulitzer Prize when it was
discovered the main subject of the story was a composite fabrication. Market
competition for audience attention and concomitant advertising dollars is an
increasingly important factor as newspapers become more market- and reader-
focused (Underwood & Stamm, 1992). If one media outlet’s coverage of events
or editorials consistently diverged from the public’s knowledge of events and
perhaps its opinions of them, then circulation may fall and reduce proﬁtability
(Schudson, 1978). In sum, although organizational constraints preclude an exact
reconstruction of every event and solicitation of every opinion, there are pressures
at multiple levels for the media to record thoroughly important events, issues, and
opinions about them for the public.

Research also suggests the media inﬂuence public knowledge and opinions,
particularly agenda-setting theory that initially proposed that media coverage of
certain issues raises the salience of these issues in the public’s agenda (McCombs
& Shaw, 1972). The possibility that the media can inﬂuence the public has its
origins in research on public opinion by Lippmann (1922) and on the effects of
Nazi and Communist propaganda (George, 1959; Lasswell, Leites, & Associates,
1965). Some research takes a microlevel approach and examines the media’s
effect on individuals. For instance, Ball–Rokeach, Rokeach, and Grube (1984)

found that a 30 minute TV show that they produced and aired in one market
resulted in a greater change in individuals beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors than in
a comparable control market. Other research takes a macro approach, using
content analyses of media and poll data of public opinion. For instance, Behr and
Iyengar (1985) found that lead CBS news stories on inﬂation and energy led to
increased public awareness of these issues in the same two-month period, using
the two-stage method to account for reciprocal effects. Ader (1995) showed that
increased attention to pollution in The New York Times was followed by increased
concern about pollution in the general public measured by the Gallup Poll 3
months later.

More recently, agenda-setting moved beyond issue salience to examine
media effects on attitudes and behaviors and the media’s inﬂuence on the social
construction of reality (Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, & Sasson, 1992; Roberts,
1992; Smith, 1995). Contingencies to agenda-setting have also been identiﬁed.
For instance, media coverage may have less effect on the public if the issue is
more obtrusive, that is, if the public has direct experience with it (Ader, 1995;
Zucker, 1978). And ﬁnally, if the media affects the public’s agenda, a further
question is what determines the media’s agenda, that is, media content (Mc-
Combs, 1992; Shoemaker & Reese, 1991). As noted above, the media cannot
record all events and opinions. Reviewing past research, McCombs (1992) ob-
served that most events and opinions appearing in the news represented main-
stream politicians, academics, and journalists.

The assumption that media coverage records and inﬂuences public knowl-
edge and opinion is applicable to reputation because media coverage is a reason-
able indicator of the public’s knowledge and opinions about ﬁrms within a few
months of the publication date. Some members of the public may have direct
knowledge and opinions of an event or issue that reporters gather for newspaper
stories. These stories may then inﬂuence those members of the public without
direct experience or strongly held opinions. For instance, knowledge and opinions
about the Exxon Valdez oil spill spread from those who lived on Prince William
Sound through the media to the rest of the world. And from a practical perspec-
tive, the agenda-setting effects appear more rapidly ,within 3 months, according
to Ader (1995) and Behr and Iyengar (1985). than the annual ﬁnancial measures
used in this research design. When the media data are aggregated to an annual
measure, the nuance of temporal dynamics may be attenuated. Brown and Deegan
(1998: 27) recognized these issues in their study comparing media and annual
report attention to the environment over multiple years: “Whether community
concern is driven, with a fairly limited time lag, by media attention (as the
majority of studies seem to indicate), or whether media attention reﬂects com-
munity concern (this being the minority view that media coverage is market
driven) is not crucial to our purposes.”

In addition to Brown and Deegan (1998) and Fombrun and Shanley (1990),
this assumption has been used in past management research. For instance, Chen
and Meindl (1991) used the agenda-setting and social constructionist view to
examine how changing portrayals in the media of Donald Burr, CEO of People
Express Airlines, inﬂuenced individual’s perceptions of him. Case studies from an

impression management perspective used the media as both a record of events and
as an indicator of social evaluation (e.g., Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Elsbach,
1994; Elsbach & Sutton, 1992).

A few notable studies used the media in statistical studies of reputation.
Fombrun and Shanley (1990) and Wartick (1992) focused on the relationship
between media coverage and the Fortune ratings but measured reputation with the
Fortune ratings. Their theoretical treatment of the media differs from the per-
spective taken here. They assumed the media contain information available for
processing by stakeholders in making reputational assessments, consistent with
the signaling role of reputation (Weigelt & Camerer, 1988). This paper enriches
their view with the mass communications perspective that assumes the media
record and inﬂuence public opinion. This perspective moves the media beyond a
provider of signals to a participant in the social construction process (Gamson et
al., 1992; Smith, 1995). More consistent with this perspective is Ferrier (1997).
He used media reports as indicators of a ﬁrm’s reputation for being a tough
competitor and found this reputation increased success in dyadic competition.

The Media Reputation of a Firm and its Resource Properties

Given these reviews, this section proceeds to integrate these theories, which
can lead to better models of strategy phenomena (Hitt et al., 1998). The media
reputation of a ﬁrm is deﬁned as the overall evaluation of a ﬁrm presented in the
media. This evaluation results from the stream of media stories about a ﬁrm. The
production of this stream is described next. The section concludes by examining
the resource properties of media reputation.

The information reported in the media comes from many sources. Company
press releases are one source, and many have public relations departments that
provide a steady stream of information to the media (Shoemaker & Reese, 1991).
Stakeholders are another source. Individuals write opinion pieces and letters to the
editor. The government and specialized rating agencies, such as Moody’s or the
Council on Economic Priorities, evaluate ﬁrms and issue their evaluations in press
releases (Fombrun, 1996). A third source is media workers (Shoemaker & Reese,
1991). Reporters write news and feature stories using various sources, and editors
and columnists also write about ﬁrms. The speciﬁc stories that appear are based
primarily on media workers’ judgments of importance and deviance from the
norm in both negative and positive directions (Shoemaker, 1996; Shoemaker,
Danielian, & Brendlinger, 1992). Other factors include proximity, timeliness,
human interest, and conﬂict, but these may have contingent relationships with
importance and deviance (Itule & Anderson, 1994; Shoemaker et al., 1992).

Conﬂicting information often appears in the media as reporters seek balance
in a story (Society of Professional Journalists, 1996). They will ask a ﬁrm to
respond to a stakeholder evaluation or ask a stakeholder to respond to a ﬁrm
action or statement. One evaluation may lead to a competing or even a supporting
evaluation by another source. Criticism by a stakeholder may raise the urgency of
its claims to managers (Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997). Thus, the media provide
a forum where ﬁrms and stakeholders debate what constitutes a good ﬁrm and
which ﬁrms have good reputations (Gamson et al., 1992; Hynds, 1994). Over

time, the stream of stories about a ﬁrm includes a record of many ﬁrm activities
and many stakeholders’ evaluations.

The media also provide information to stakeholders, reducing information
asymmetry. Some stakeholders lack direct experience with a ﬁrm. Instead they
rely on information intermediaries, such as the government, rating agencies, and
the media, who, “screen, spin, and broker information for us; they help us make
sense of companies’ complex activities – and so affect company reputations”
(Fombrun, 1996: 139; McQuail, 1985). The media report the evaluations of other
information intermediaries and provide a consolidated source of information for
stakeholders. The media thus is a counteracting institution that reduces stakehold-
ers’ uncertainty about a ﬁrm’s characteristics, ﬁlling reputation’s signaling role
(Akerloff, 1970; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Weigelt & Camerer, 1988). Given
these attributes of media reputation, the next step is to examine media reputation
in terms of the resource properties mentioned above: valuable, imperfect imita-
bility, nonsubstitutability, and rarity (Barney, 1991; cf. Chi, 1994; Conner, 1991;
Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Peteraf, 1993; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990).

A resource has the value property if it enhances efﬁciency or effectiveness
(Barney, 1991). In general, reputation facilitates value creation by signaling
current and potential exchange partners, including employees, suppliers, inves-
tors, and customers (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). In contracting with these
partners, a good reputation provides at least three valuable strategic beneﬁts: (1)
it allows a ﬁrm to lower cost; (2) it allows a ﬁrm to increase price; and (3) it can
create competitive barriers. If media reputation is a resource, it should add value
to the ﬁrm in at least one of these ways. To demonstrate the value property, we
describe how a media story can confer all three strategic beneﬁts. The example is
a newspaper story listing Twin Cities’ ﬁrms with family friendly human resource
policies, such as ﬂex-time and on-site child care (Hage, 1989). This story indicates
the quality of the ﬁrm as a workplace and signals employees about
it. A
well-regarded ﬁrm can offer lower wages to employees who prefer family-
friendly policies to wages, thus lowering costs. This ﬁrm also may attract higher
quality employees. They may be more efﬁcient and less likely to shirk, reducing
costs of production and of controlling for moral hazards. They may help the ﬁrm
improve quality and develop better products, enabling it to raise prices. Finally,
certain employees may only want to work for a family friendly ﬁrm. This creates
a competitive barrier because they would seek employment at the ﬁrms mentioned
in the story ﬁrst. Thus, a media story can confer valuable strategic beneﬁts.
Similar reasoning can be applied to other stories, including critical ones.

The imperfect imitability property refers to the challenges and costs a ﬁrm
faces when trying to copy a resource of another ﬁrm (Barney, 1991). The content
of media stories is produced through a complex interaction of individual media
workers, their working routines, the organizations they work for, external inﬂu-
ences (including ﬁrm and stakeholder sources of news), and ideology (Shoemaker
& Reese, 1991). Thus, media reputation is a collective concept connecting the
ﬁrm, media workers, stakeholder sources of news about ﬁrms, and the readers of
news. Media reputation develops over time through a complex social process
involving the ﬁrm and its stakeholders, an important characteristic of reputation

generally (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Company reputation was perceived to
have one of the longest replacement periods, according to Hall’s (1992) survey of
U.K. executives. The length of time needed to develop a good media reputation
suggests it has the property of time compression diseconomies that reduces
imitability (Dierickx & Cool, 1989). There is also the lack of an open market for
reputations, except for the acquisition of the ﬁrm itself (Caves, 1980; Conner,
1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Peteraf, 1993). In sum, the complex and social
nature of media reputation implies it may be hard to imitate (Barney, 1991).

the same strategies. Barney (1991) pointed out

A resource also should be nonsubstitutable (Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool,
1989). Substitutability means there are other resources that allow a ﬁrm to
implement
that a favorable
reputation represents a psychological contract between the ﬁrm and its stakehold-
ers and differs from long-term formal commitments like contracts or guarantees
that might substitute for a good reputation. Because ﬁrms try to do both, he
concluded they are not close substitutes. Similarly, although product manufactur-
ers may have the same guarantees, some may have better reputations for reliabil-
ity. For instance, customers use the reliability ratings of J. D. Power or Consumer
Reports to form judgments of reliability for a particular product, and collectively
this contributes to an overall reputation for reliability. Barney (1991) also points
out that very different resources can be strategic substitutes. A study that measures
many resources can test if one is a substitute for another, but the current lack of
generalizable resource measures makes this difﬁcult (Godfrey & Hill, 1995; Hitt
et al., 1998). The recognition that product-market positions and resources “are two
sides of the same coin” (Wernerfelt, 1984: 171) can be used to assess substitut-
ability of these different resources indirectly. Product-market positions represent
bundles of underlying resources (Wernerfelt, 1984). The inclusion of these
positions in a model partially controls for these resource bundles. Like Russo and
Fouts (1997), who included many strategy variables, this study includes measures
of product market position and tests to see if they attenuate the effect of media
reputation on performance. Lastly, to the extent resources are unobservable,
speciﬁcation of an autoregressive model controls for these unobservable resources
(Dess, Gupta, Hennart, & Hill, 1995; Godfrey & Hill, 1995; Jacobson, 1990).

The last property is rarity. A resource is rare to the extent that other ﬁrms do
not have the same resource. Barney (1991: 107) pointed out that rarity is difﬁcult
to evaluate. One necessary condition for rarity is variation in the media reputa-
tions of ﬁrms, such that some have better reputations than others do. This is
analogous to differences in brand loyalty among products in an industry, such as
soft drinks.

In sum, the media record much information about a ﬁrm, including its
activities and evaluations of it by stakeholders. Media reputation, the overall
evaluation of a ﬁrm presented in the media, may also inﬂuence other stakeholders’
knowledge and opinions about a ﬁrm. A favorable media reputation may have the
resource properties of rarity, value, imperfect imitability, and nonsubstitutability.
Thus:

Proposition: A more favorable media reputation increases perfor-
mance.

Methods

Sample and Data Sources

This proposition was examined empirically in a population of commercial
banks competing in a single metropolitan area from 1988 through 1992. The
population of banks was located in the metropolitan area of Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Minnesota, U.S.A. (Twin Cities). A metropolitan area was selected because bank
antitrust regulators deﬁned a competitive market in banking as a metropolitan area
during the period under study (Berger, 1995; Federal Reserve Bulletin, 1991;
Liang, 1989; Smirlock, 1985). Banks in a single market compete by offering
similar products to similar customers and by seeking similar factors of production,
such as employees (Chen, 1996). Banks in a single market also compete for
reputation among the same set of stakeholders. Thus, this site is a good location
to test if media reputation affects performance because it controls for differences
in community values and product and factor markets.

The banks were identiﬁed from the Call Reports database of U.S. bank
regulators. The Call Reports are detailed ﬁnancial statements required by regu-
lators. The unit of analysis is the bank-year. The period 1988 through 1992 was
selected to emphasize measurement accuracy over a ﬁve-year period within
resource constraints (Sudman, 1976). There were 121 independent banks in the
Twin Cities during the period, six of which were publicly traded. After entries and
exits, the total number of observations totaled 526. Financial variables were
measured from the Call Reports; media reputation was measured by a content
analysis of newspaper archives; and hypotheses were tested with regression. Thus,
the research design integrated quantitative and qualitative methods to test the
resource-based view of the ﬁrm, as suggested by a recent review (Hoskisson, Hitt,
Wan, & Yiu, 1999: 447).
Dependent Variable: ROA

Relative return on average assets (Relative ROA) was the performance
measure used here. Because bank assets change over time, average assets were
used in the denominator, consistent with bank regulatory practice. Reger, Du-
haime, and Stimpert (1992: 195) declared that “ROA is the most meaningful
ﬁnancial indicator in the banking industry. . . ” (cf. Gilbert, 1984; Mehra, 1996).
ROA measures how well a ﬁrm utilizes its assets and controls for differences in
size and capital structure. Relative ROA is the difference between a bank’s ROA
and the average ROA of all Twin Cities’ banks in that year. This measure thus
indicates how well a bank is doing relative to its competitors. It also controls for
many economic and industry structure factors that vary over time, such as general
business conditions and concentration.
Independent Variable: Media Reputation

Past research implies that local print media best covers local businesses.
Palmgreen and Clarke (1977) showed that newspapers had a stronger effect than

television in setting the public’s agenda for local issues. Moreover, Stempel
(1991) found that 67.3% of the respondents to a nationwide survey got their news
about local businesses from the local newspaper; television, radio, and other
people all scored less than 27.1%. Audience recall is stronger from newspaper
stories (DeFleur, Davenport, Cronin, & DeFleur, 1992; Robinson & Levy, 1996),
and recall of information about a bank may lead to action regarding it (Fiske &
Taylor, 1984; Schramm, 1949). Together, these studies imply that newspapers
would be the best media source of public knowledge and opinions about banks.
The selected newspapers were the Twin Cities’ two metropolitan dailies, The
Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Saint Paul Pioneer Press. These two have the
largest circulations in the area. Readers include customers, suppliers, employees,
regulators, and other stakeholders. Thus, these two papers should provide a good
source for measuring media reputation using content analysis.

The sample of articles included all letters to the editor, all editorials, all
columns, and a stratiﬁed sample of the remaining articles. All letters, editorials,
and columns were included because they represent interpretations of ﬁrms that are
overt attempts to inﬂuence attitudes (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). There was a
two-step process for selecting the remaining articles. For each bank with fewer
than eight articles in a year, all articles were selected to increase accuracy. For
banks with more than eight, a total of eight plus 25% of the remaining number of
articles were randomly selected. A sampling fraction of 25% is well above that
used in past communication research (e.g., Dickson, 1992; Riffe, Aust, & Lacy,
1993). In total, this sampling procedure yielded 1277 articles.

Coding the articles entailed identifying and rating recording units (Weber,
1990). This paper deﬁned a recording unit as the evaluation of an individual bank
in a single article. Because many articles mention several banks, 2071 recording
units were identiﬁed. Only 275 (13.3%) were from letters, editorials, and col-
umns; the rest (86.7%) were from news articles. Each recording unit was rated as
favorable, unfavorable, or neutral, following common practice in media research
(Janis & Fadner, 1965; Weber, 1990). A summary of each rating follows. A
recording unit was rated favorable when a bank was praised for its actions or
associated with actions that past research indicated should increase a ﬁrm’s
reputation. Examples of the latter include: awards given to the bank or its
employees (Fombrun, 1996); monetary or in-kind donations (Fombrun & Shan-
ley, 1990); and director linkages to other organizations (Weigelt & Camerer,
1988). An unfavorable rating occurred when a bank was criticized for its actions
or associated with actions that past research indicated should decrease a ﬁrm’s
reputation. There were few of the latter, except for legal or regulatory charges.
More often, an author or source criticized a bank’s actions. The essence of a
neutral rating was the declarative reporting of role performance without evalua-
tive modiﬁers. Essential roles for banks included lending, holding deposits,
purchasing from suppliers, trying to expand market share and proﬁtability, and so
forth This rating was also given when there was a balance of favorable and
unfavorable reporting.

The author read and coded full text versions of all sampled articles. A
colleague was instructed to use the same coding scheme on a random sample of

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT, VOL. 26, NO. 6, 2000


1102

D. L. DEEPHOUSE

52 articles from the ﬁrst year of coding (23%). The two raters agreed on 65 of the
71 recording units (91.5%), suggesting high intercoder reliability (Weber, 1990).
After the coding was complete, a second colleague coded a random sample of 30
articles from a different year. The two coders agreed on 83.3% of the codes.
Together, these checks enhance the reliability of the coding process (Weber,
1990).

The recording units were aggregated into annual measures suitable for
statistical analysis using the Janis-Fadner coefﬁcient of imbalance (Janis &
Fadner, 1965). Initially developed for analyzing wartime propaganda, it measures
the relative proportion of favorable to unfavorable articles while controlling for
the overall volume of articles. Each article is given equal weight in the measure,
consistent with past research (Brown & Deegan, 1998; Dickson, 1992). The
resulting variable was called the coefﬁcient of media favorableness. Its formula is:

Coefﬁcient of media favorableness 55(f 2 2 fu)/(total)2 if f . u;

0 if f 5 u;
(fu 2 u2)/(total)2 if u . f;

where f 5 number of favorable recording units for a bank in a given year; u 5
number of unfavorable recording units for a bank in that year; and total 5 the total
number of recording units for the bank in that year. The range of this variable is
(21, 1), where 1 indicates all positive coverage, 21 indicates all unfavorable
coverage, and 0 indicates a balance between the two over the year.

Given that performance is measured by ROA and media reputation by the
coefﬁcient of media favorableness, the proposition that ﬁrms with more favorable
media reputations have higher performance is tested with the following hypoth-
esis:

Hypothesis: The coefﬁcient of media favorableness is positively re-
lated to ROA.

Control Variables

Variables were added to control for other effects on performance. Larger
banks should be more proﬁtable than smaller ones because they may tacitly
collude to control prices, have greater economies of scale or scope, or have
superior efﬁciency (Demsetz, 1973; Gale, 1972). The latter two reﬂect underlying
resources. Smirlock (1985) and Berger (1995) found support in the banking
industry for the superior efﬁciency argument of Demsetz (1973). Thus, including
market share enhances the assessment of nonsubstitutability because market
positions and resources are two sides of the same coin (Wernerfelt, 1984). Firm
size was measured using market share of deposits, consistent with prior bank
research (e.g., Berger, 1995; Smirlock, 1985).

A ﬁrm’s product market strategies should have an impact on performance
(Rumelt, Schendel, & Teece, 1994). Principal product market strategies in bank-

ing are asset allocation decisions (Santomero, 1984). Banks have to decide how
much and when to invest in each asset category, such as real estate lending. A
resource underlying these allocation decisions is managerial ability to identify
proﬁtable markets (Castanias & Helfat, 1991), so their inclusion partially tests the
resource property of nonsubstitutability. This paper used the four asset strategies
common to Reger et al. (1992), Mehra (1996), and Swamy, Barth, Chou, and
Jahera (1996): Commercial Loans, Real Estate Loans, Individual Loans, and
Agricultural Loans. Each asset strategy was measured as a proportion of total
assets.

The lagged dependent variable was also included. It controls for unobserv-
ables (Dess et al., 1995; Godfrey & Hill, 1995; Jacobson, 1990). It also reﬂects the
possibility that changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable
over multiple time periods (Fomby, Hill, & Johnson, 1984; Hitt et al., 1998).
Finally, inclusion of this variable enhances the causal inferences that can be drawn
(Hitt et al., 1998).

The sample forms a panel combining individual banks over ﬁve successive years
(Greene, 1993). Several issues must be addressed to analyze the data. The ﬁrst,
and perhaps most important, is sample selection. After completing data collection,
we discovered that all banks were not covered by the media in every year.
Speciﬁcally, 265 of the 526 observations had measures of media reputation.
Because media reputation is measured only for banks covered by the media, there
may be sample selection bias (Heckman, 1979). That is, results based on the banks
with media scores may not apply to all the banks in the period, raising general-
izability concerns. To correct for this potential bias, Heckman’s (1979) two-step
procedure was used. The ﬁrst step tests whether or not a bank was in the estimated
sample (i.e., had any media coverage). This was estimated with a probit model on
all 526 observations. Larger size and having locations in the central cities and
counties of the Twin Cities were signiﬁcant predictors of being covered in the
media. The probit estimates are used to create a variable called the “inverse Mills
ratio.” The second step adds this variable to the regression model to correct for
sample selection bias.

Two other important issues in panel data are heteroskedasticity and autocor-
relation,
two violations of ordinary least squares regression (Greene, 1993;
Kennedy, 1985). The latter was assumed to be ﬁrst order autocorrelation, consis-
tent with most econometric work using annual data (Greene, 1993; Jacobsen,

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT, VOL. 26, NO. 6, 2000

1988). Durbin’s t-statistic was used to assess the presence of autocorrelation when
a lagged dependent variable is in the model (Durbin, 1970). This statistic equaled
2.28 (p , .39, n.s.), so autocorrelation was not a problem here. Heteroskedas-
ticity was evaluated by examining plots of residuals versus ﬁtted values and
independent variables. The “megaphone opening left” shape of the residual plot
versus loans for agricultural production suggested that the error variance was
inversely proportional to this variable. A special case of generalized least squares
called weighted least squares was used to produce unbiased, minimum variance
estimates (Greene, 1993; Kennedy, 1985).

A ﬁnal issue is multicollinearity among independent variables. This was
evaluated using condition numbers (Belsley, Kuh, & Welsch, 1980). The largest
value of 24.2 was less than the 30 suggested as being cause for concern (Belsley
et al. 1980; Kennedy, 1985).

Hierarchical weighted least squares regression was used for the ﬁnal esti-
mates. Model 1 estimated the control variables, including the sample selection
correction. Model 2 added the coefﬁcient of media favorableness to assess its
impact on the model. The weighted least squares transformation negates the
interpretability of R2 goodness of ﬁt measures. Consequently, Models 1 and 2
were compared statistically using F-tests computed with sums of squared errors
(Greene, 1993; Grifﬁths, Hill, and Judge, 1993). Pseudo R2 statistics are reported
for reference, although this statistic should be interpreted cautiously.

Results

Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlations among all
study variables for the 265 observations having media coverage. The mean of the
coefﬁcient of media favorableness was .22, and its standard deviation was 0.37.
These results indicate that media reputation differed among banks in the sample,
a necessary condition for resource rarity. The coefﬁcient of media favorableness

was correlated .14 with ROA, suggesting that media reputation has less of a
ﬁnancial performance halo than the Fortune ratings do (Brown & Perry, 1994).
Moreover, its correlation with market share of deposits was 2.12 (n.s.), implying
that size was not related to a favorable media reputation.

Table 2 presents the weighted least squares estimates. Model 1 presents the
results for the model of control variables. The coefﬁcient for the log of market
share was positive (b 5 .09) and signiﬁcant (p , .05), consistent with expecta-
tions. Coefﬁcients for asset strategies were nonsigniﬁcant. The lagged dependent
variable was positive and signiﬁcant, as expected.

Model 2 added the coefﬁcient of media favorableness. The estimated coef-
ﬁcient for this variable was positive (b 5 .22) and signiﬁcant (p , .05). Adding
this variable signiﬁcantly improved the ﬁt of the model (DSSE 5 .02; F(1,255)
5
4.77; p , .05). Because lagged ROA is in the model, a larger coefﬁcient of media
favorableness increases ROA over the past year (Hitt et al., 1998). The pseudo R2
increased from .37 to .39. There were no noteworthy changes in the other
coefﬁcients. In sum, these results support the paper’s principal hypothesis that the
coefﬁcient of media favorableness improves ROA.1

An alternative hypothesis worth investigating, however, is that ROA in-
creases the coefﬁcient of media favorableness. This was evaluated using tests of

Granger causality, which examine if a dependent variable predicts an independent
variable (Granger, 1969). Granger’s original test regressed past values of the
original dependent variable (ROA) and past values of the original independent
variable (coefﬁcient of media favorableness) on the current value of the indepen-
dent variable. The coefﬁcient for lagged ROA was not signiﬁcant (b 5 .02; SE 5

Discussion and Conclusion

The resource-based view of the ﬁrm proposed that a favorable reputation is
an intangible asset that increases ﬁrm performance (Barney, 1991; Hall, 1992).
Empirical research testing this has been constrained by using the atheoretical
Fortune ratings to measure reputation (Baucus, 1995; Fryxell & Wang, 1994;
Sodeman, 1995). This paper incorporated mass communications theory to develop
the concept media reputation, deﬁned as the overall presentation of a ﬁrm in the
media. Theoretical and empirical analysis indicated that media reputation was
valuable, rare, nonsubstitutable, and imperfectly imitable, four properties of a
resource (Barney, 1991). Thus, media reputation may be useful in reputation
research and the resource-based view of the ﬁrm.

This paper found that media reputation increased the pseudo R2 of ROA by
0.02. Although this could be considered small on an absolute scale, it is less so in
the context of the Twin Cities banking market and past research by Russo and
Fouts (1997). The latter found that including a ﬁrm’s environmental rating in a
model predicting ROA increased the explained variance by 0.01, a 4% change in
the variance explained. The inclusion of media reputation in this paper increased
the pseudo R2 by more than 5%. In their regressions, Russo and Fouts (1997)
included control variables appropriate for multi-industry studies (Capon et al.,
1990). This paper included bank-speciﬁc variables used in past research (Berger,
1995; Mehra, 1996; Reger et al., 1992; Swamy et al., 1996). Analysis of the ﬁrst
derivative indicates that if a Twin Cities bank increased its media reputation by
0.37 (one standard deviation), its relative ROA would increase by .08 percentage
points. In a sample where the average ROA was 0.84%, this change of almost
10% could help fund the development of other resources. Such increases in
performance can be critical in competitive markets.

Given the promising results for media reputation, an important subject for
future research is understanding the determinants of media reputation. Correlation
and Granger causality tests did not suggest that size and performance had an
important impact, but the relationships between these variables and media repu-
tation may be more complex. Other factors may also have an effect on media
reputation. Moreover, these factors may have interactions with size and perfor-
mance. Future theoretical development and empirical testing is necessary to
uncover these determinants and relationships.

JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT, VOL. 26, NO. 6, 2000


MEDIA REPUTATION

1107

Another subject for future research is the intermediary status of media
reputation among the concepts of ﬁrm action, stakeholder opinion and action, and
performance. One important issue is that the media could not report a ﬁrm’s action
without the ﬁrm taking the action. For instance, the media couldn’t have written
about a bank’s charitable giving, a common practice among Twin Cities ﬁrms
(Galaskiewicz, 1997), without knowing about a bank’s giving (or lack thereof).
And without the actions, their favorableness could not be evaluated. A limitation
of this paper is that it did not separate the direct effects of ﬁrm actions on
performance and the indirect effects of the actions through the reputation process.
For instance, the direct effect of charitable giving on performance is negative for
it reduces net income. Reputation theory proposes a positive indirect effect
because the public favors ﬁrms that donate in contracting decisions (Fombrun,
1996). The extent to which the public learns about charitable giving from the
media or some other source, such as the ﬁrm or a friend, is also an issue.
Determining the order, direction, and magnitude of these effects is an important
issue for future research.

In the context of the resource-based view of the ﬁrm, two properties of a
resource that could be addressed better are nonsubstitutability and rarity. Finding
variation in the distribution of media reputation is a necessary, but not sufﬁcient,
condition for rarity. The challenge of evaluating rarity was raised by Barney
(1991). Nonsubstitutability was inferred by assuming that product market posi-
tions and past performance reﬂected bundles of underlying ﬁrm resources, con-
sistent with Wernerfelt (1984). As research improves its ability to measure
resources, future research could incorporate them as direct controls.

There are many methodological choices for research measuring media rep-
utation with content analysis (Weber, 1990). One choice is the speciﬁc media
outlets sampled. This study of local business sampled daily newspapers because
of past research on how people learn about local business (DeFleur et al., 1992;
Stempel, 1991). Other studies of large U.S. ﬁrms analyzed television news
(Wartick, 1992) and business periodicals (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Including
other media sources should improve the speciﬁcity of the analyses and increase
our understanding of media reputation. A second choice is the document coded.
This study coded the full text of articles to improve measurement accuracy, but
others coded only titles or abstracts (e.g., Fombrun & Shanley, 1990).

A third methodological choice is the type of article. This study sampled all
types: news, letters to the editor, editorials, and columns. Certain types of articles
may have different impacts, however. To investigate this, a post hoc analysis was
conducted. As noted in the research design, most of the ratings of banks (86.7%)
came from news articles. A coefﬁcient of news article favorableness was calcu-
lated for these and substituted in the regression model. The pattern of parameter
estimates was similar to those reported in Table 2, and only 4 of 265 observations
were lost. Most notably, the coefﬁcient of news article favorableness was positive
and signiﬁcant (b 5 .23; SE 5 .10; p , .05). For non-news articles, unfortu-
nately, sample sizes dropped by over 80%, and regression estimates were non-
signiﬁcant. In sum, future research could investigate the robustness and costs of
different content analysis methodologies.

There are limitations to this study that should be investigated in future
research. Although this study demonstrated that reputation applies in a sample
outside the large corporations rated by Fortune, future research could examine if
these ﬁndings generalize to samples besides Twin Cities banks. Another limitation
of this study is that it only used accounting performance because most observa-
tions were from privately held banks. An advantage of studying publicly traded
ﬁrms, like those in the Fortune ratings, is that stock market performance is
available. A third limitation is spuriousness. Although the research design con-
trolled for many ﬁrm-level and contextual variables, there may be other variables
that drive the relationship between the coefﬁcient of media favorableness and
ROA (Cook & Campbell, 1979; Kennedy, 1985). Fourth, media reputation
captures the evaluations of ﬁrms made by many different stakeholders, but this
measure is relatively coarse in that it captures only those evaluations that are made
publicly. Although this suggests these stakeholders have greater urgency (Mitch-
ell et al., 1997), private evaluations by other stakeholders may also be important
for competitive advantage. Future research might examine the ﬁrm’s reputation
from the perspective of different stakeholders and investigate their relative im-
portance using other measures. Finally, the assumptions about media coverage are
based on research that primarily studied policy issues, not business issues. Future
research should examine if such assumptions hold for business issues. The
dynamics of such relationships also warrant greater attention.

The ﬁnding that media reputation may inﬂuence performance has one central
implication for managers: they should seek to cultivate positive evaluations by the
media. This should not be done just by sophisticated public relations; instead, it
should have a foundation in actual actions throughout the ﬁrm (Caudron, 1997;
Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Hall, 1993). The post hoc analysis of news articles is
supportive of this admonition. News stories included reports of ﬁrm actions. Some
of these actions (like charitable donations) are viewed favorably in reputation
research, and others are viewed positively by stakeholders. As research uncovers
the determinants of a positive media reputation, further practical implications can
be expected.

To conclude, this study expands our knowledge of reputation as a resource.
It develops a variant of the reputation concept called media reputation, deﬁned as
the overall evaluation of a ﬁrm presented in the media. Theoretical analysis of its
resource properties and empirical testing of its impact on performance provides
evidence that media reputation is a strategic resource.

These two models were also estimated with net income per employee as the dependent variable (Mehra,
1996). Results (available on request) were similar to those for ROA, which enhances conﬁdence in the
results (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). Model 2 was also run with the number of favorable and
unfavorable articles as independent variables, excluding the neutral articles. Both were signiﬁcant at the
